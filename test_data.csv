her unfavorable ratings have hit that makes her more popular than the bubonic plague obamacare osama bin ladens corpse its not much to go on but the atlantic decided to run a piece by chimamanda adichie titledwhy is hillary clinton so widely loved your response to seeing the name chimamanda adichie was probably huh unless youre a gender studies student at an ivy in which case you know exactly who she is and love her chimamanda adichie is a nigerian novelist whose we should all be feminists is big in those circles the clinton campaign is unbearably awkward and this panegyric by adichie was an obvious attempt to channel some of that canned obama poetry and like most hillary branding it fails badly there are howlers like there are millions who admire the tapestry of hillary clintons past and there are people who when hillary clinton becomes the first woman to be president of the united states will weep from joy its not quite a hymn to comrade stalin nor is it getting there by any means except a tow truck and then theres the phrasing oh the phrasing hillary clinton was guilty immediately when she stepped into the view of the american public as the first lady of arkansas this is an awkward attempt to channel that obama poetry but instead it reads like a dvd manual badly translated from the japanese the atlantic piece is full of lines that straddle the border between tineared propagandistic cliche and just bad writing she was a lawyer full of dreams she was guilty of not being a traditional first lady she offended the old patriarchal order then theres the theme of the article which is to just deny reality a conservative writer labeled her a congenital liar when she was first lady and the label stuck because it was repeated over and overand it was a convenient label to harness misogyny if she was a liar then the hostility she engendered could not possibly be because she was a first lady who refused to be still and silent liar has reemerged during this election even though politifact a respected source of information about politicians has certified that she is more honest than most politicians the perfect timing for that defense would have been not right after hillary clinton shouted at a rally that she had been in new york on but dont worry hillary is more honest than most politicians a site supporting her said so other words have been repeated over and over with no context until they have begun to breathe and thrum with life especially emails the press coverage of emails has become an unclear morass where emails must mean something terrible if only because of how often it is invoked how about classified emails or illegal server or violation of regulations dealing with the handling of classified material thats got lots of context or coverup the people who love hillary clinton know that the it system at the state department is old and stodgy nothing like a blackberrys smooth whirl hillary clinton was used to her blackberry and wanted to keep using it when she became secretary of state people who love hillary know that she love high tech blackberry hillary love blackberry she is a lawyer full of dreams who fights for the children of migrant workers and loves their smooth whirl politifact thrums with life says her blackberry is more honest than the iphone hillary has many dreams of thrumming blackberries whirling smoothly that offend the traditional stodgy patriarchal order it system the american conservative media saw an opportunity to blow the emails story out of proportion soon followed almost bashfully by the rest of the american media is that how it works in nigeria because thats not how it works in america there is no objective basis on which to equate hillary clinton to her opponent theyre both mammals they need oxygen to live theyre better writers than chimamanda adichie the people who love hillary clinton see the failings of the general american media where news entertains rather than informs they bristle when benign stories about her are covered with an ominous tone they bristle and they hug their blackberry and weep for they fear that the patriarchal stodgy it systems will prevent hillary from being the thrumming first lady of north america they know that she is a bit too careful but they understand that she has to be that she cannot afford spontaneity you would think with all those six figure speeches she could afford a little her actions so falsely magnified that she leaned into caution wrapped herself in a kind of caution that sometimes makes her appear stilted and wrapped in her caution her whirling blackberry in one hand she bristled at the public retracting her quills and occasionally hissing in an informed fashion for the children of migrant workers who admired the tapestry of her past there are millions of americans who do not have the selfindulgent expectation that a politician be perfect they are frustrated that hillary clinton is allowed no complexity get beyonce on the phone i think adichie has got another hit,1

work as an excellent article published earlier today at the daily caller demonstrates heres some of what we learned the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta the democrats campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik a top official at the justice department the dinner arrangement revealed in hacked podesta emails released by wikileaks is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server says matthew whitaker the executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust a government watchdog group kadzik who started at the doj in helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office in a sept email which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by independent counsel kenneth starr for the investigation but he defended the falsehoods saying later that he was merely relaying false information from clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time he did lie to me podesta said about clinton in a national public radio interview in clinton was acquitted by the senate in feb of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the lewinsky probe kadzik then a lawyer with the firm dickstein shapiro morin oshinsky represented podesta through the fiasco podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for years when he sought the pardon to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan a house oversight committee report released in may stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another to the clinton presidential library the first mention of personal contact between podesta and kadzik in the wikileaks dump is in an oct email sent out by vincent roberti a lobbyist who is close to podesta and his superlobbyist brother tony podesta in it roberti refers to a dinner reservation at posto a washington dc restaurant the dinner was set for that evening just a day after clinton gave hours of testimony to the benghazi committee podesta and kadzik met several months later for dinner at podestas home another email shows and in an email sent on may kadziks son asked podesta for a job on the clinton campaign ill have the lobster risotto with a side of cronyism and middle class destruction as head of the office of legislative affairs kadzik handles inquiries from congress on a variety of issues in that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the clinton investigation the justice department and fbi have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation which concluded in july with no charges filed against clinton but kadzik worked on other clinton email issues in his dealings with congress last november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation seems like a pretty important decision for a clinton crony to make the justice department declined to comment on the record for this article could the department of injustice have any less credibility for more on the shameless and shady fbi investigation into hillary clinton see,0

always easy and tempting to look at problems real or imagined outside of the beltway and solve them from afar you will recall of course how former attorney general eric holder was going to stop police shootings all over america with sensitivity training the power and force of the federal government and investigations investigations and more investigations now loretta lynch his successor also known as hillary clintons guardian angel is set to turn police shootings throughout america into big business and more power for washington her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians she reported this month accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about communitypolice relations lynch said in the days ahead the department of justice will continue to work alongside our local state tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive useful and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve the irony here is thick indeed one of lynchs goals she says is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them meanwhile lynch presides over the most egregious coverup of the most outrageous police shooting case i have ever seen in my life namely the killing of miriam carey a young black mother with baby in tow who was gunned down by washington cops and secret service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital lynch wants reports so does wnd which has been pursuing the information through freedom of information act requests and finally after being stonewalled for years a lawsuit so does the public and the family of miriam carey unfortunately lynch is holding back on a few things missing evidence the page memo with findings analysis of evidence and conclusions in the carey shooting investigation this would show the evidence and reasoning that led the department of justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers why they considered this a justifiable homicide or whether they should have based on the evidence why officers used deadly force whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies video of shooting at capitol police guard post at intersection of

shaken to the core by the latest revelations from fbi director james comey on friday october as reported by nbc news on october th fbi obtains warrant for newly discovered emails in clinton probe as reid accuses comey of hatch act violation once again the clinton scandal is creating turmoil in a presidential election that has gone way beyond unconventional indeed tom clancy could not have scripted this years presidential election and intrigues while comeys recent remarks regarding the clinton investigation have been extremely vague the issue to focus on is how hillarys use of a private computer server private email account and nonsecure digital devices to store send and receive classified materials may have drawn others into her tangled web of deception the current focus of the clinton quagmire is on whether or not the laptop computer shared by weiner and his estranged wife contains sensitive information if that laptop had been hacked both weiner and abedin could have been vulnerable to blackmail this was an issue raised by congressman louie gohmert texan republican and former judge in a fox news business interview on october in a segment that was posted under the title rep gohmert clinton is a potential victim of blackmail additional individuals may also have been drawn into this web of deception through these emails as well a chain is as strong as its weakest link the weak links begin with hillary clinton and huma abedin and may now include anthony weiner and perhaps others meanwhile there is no way to yet determine how many other weak links are out there petrified that wikileaks or perhaps a hacker may yet disclose their improper dealings with the clintons or their foundation could not these additional individuals be subject to blackmail as well lets take a moment to understand how all of this began just months earlier hillary clinton had been let off the hook by an fbi director who in his official statement on july included this excerpt to be clear this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences to the contrary those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions but that is not what we are deciding now by comeys own words anyone else might have had their security clearance lifted permanently this raises the issue about such an individual demonstrating fitness for duty as president and raises the question as to why comey did not see fit to take comparable action with ms clinton comeys ultimate decision to not present the case to a grand jury was frustrating to those who have had security clearances and fully understand just how profound an impact these transgressions might have on national security however perhaps comeys hard to comprehend decision can be traced to a meeting between bill clinton and attorney general loretta lynch less than one week before the fbi director conducted that press conference on june abc news reported us attorney general loretta lynch bill clinton meet privately in phoenix before benghazi report that article served as a predication for my article loretta lynchs private meeting with bill clinton prior to release of benghazi report why would the attorney general who sets the tone for law enforcement do this as attorney general lynch is fbi director comeys boss at the time of this meeting the justice department was not only investigating hillarys illegal use of a private email server nonsecure personal digital devices but was also conducting an investigation into the clinton foundation in fact on october breitbart reported clinton foundation fbi investigation confirmed by former assistant fbi director therefore bill clinton was likely the target of an ongoing criminal investigation yet he had a totally inappropriate private meeting with the attorney general to supposedly discuss golfing and grandchildren however just days after that meeting news organizations reported that hillary was contemplating keeping lynch on as attorney general if she won the election on july newsmax reported ny times clinton weighs keeping lynch as attorney general if she wins hillarys statement that she might keep lynch on as attorney general could have provided the incentive for lynch to go along to get along indeed lynch did precisely that during her confirmation hearing as i described in my commentary loretta lynch same as the old boss the attorney general nominees disturbing views on us immigration law my article included an excerpt from a yahooap news report attorney general nominee defends obama immigration changes here is the exchange in which lynch discussed the administrations immigrations policies lynch said she had no involvement in drafting the measures but called them a reasonable way to marshal limited resources to deal with the problem of illegal immigration she said the homeland security department was focusing on removals of the most dangerous of the undocumented immigrants among us pressed by sen jeff sessions of alabama a leading immigration hardliner she said citizenship was not a right for people in the country illegally but rather a privilege that must be earned however when sessions asked whether individuals in the country legally or those who are here unlawfully have more of a right to a job lynch replied the right and the obligation to work is one thats shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here sessions quickly issued a news release to highlight that response under later questioning by democratic sen chuck schumer of new york lynch clarified it stating there is no right to work for an immigrant who has no lawful status this was disturbing and telling clearly ms lynchs views on immigration and likely therefore on other issues are malleable and subject to revision if modifying her position is consistent with her personal goals as attorney general lynch directs the operations of the entire justice department and all those who work for that department ms lynch must understand true democracy can only exist when justice is blind and totally objective however lynch and the others who have fallen under hillary clintons corrupt sphere of influence are trapped in hillarys web of deception having fallen victim to the hillary virus throughout clintons many decades in american politics this highly contagious and virulent malady has proven to be virtually ineradicable it is not likely to change no matter the outcome of the next election,1

take them long to get established she will find a group of her countrywomen other thais vietnamese or ukrainians they will teach her the ropes where to go shopping for the kind of groceries she needs the most efficient way to send money to her relatives back home where her fellow countrymen hang out and oh yes they will also learn american culture their friends will explain about american men and american divorce law and that is where the trouble starts my vietnamese war bride an upscale frenchified thing informed me after just over a year of marriage after i had helped her family escape saigon that a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle when the inevitable the divorce came she refused a reasonable settlement offer and hired a junkyard dog lawyer to fight it in court losing she was shocked to discover that that offer was off the table keep your woman in her own country where she is comfortable and where the culture is more likely to appreciate men you make the adjustment

miles south of where another major tributary the pripyat flows in from the west from their capital in kyiv the viking princes could easily sally out in their long boats to the black sea or anywhere in western russia the sandy river beaches are good for swimming from june to september and for fishing any time it isnt frozen one can rent kayaks and rowboats or take a river cruise in the warmer months when it does freeze it is dotted with ice fishermen all it takes is a saw some bait a line and the antifreeze of ones choice there are bicycle paths along the river and on the islands in the middle of the river the city is experiencing a surge in the number of bicycle commuters the soviet system had its good points they housed everybody in highrise apartments it may not be as attractive as detached houses but it makes for a very compact city those people needed places to breathe and exercise so the city is full of parks as compact as kyiv is it is with most people living in apartment blocks it easy to get around every place in the city is within walking distance of a convenience store of some sort and restaurants and shopping centers are usually within a walk or a short bus ride young people the world over want to live in the city and kyiv is no exception it has lots of bars cafés and nightclubs the trends are toward sushi and italian food ukraine is traditional enough that young people even go to church there are orthodox churches in every neighborhood and a handful of englishspeaking congregations scattered throughout the city kyiv is home to ukraines most famous universities shevchenko university kyivmohyla academy and kyiv polytechnic institute these are their harvard yale and mit an extraordinarily high percentage of business and government leaders have graduated from them they know each other as in the united states just being admitted to these universities is a sign of intelligence and talent for a foreigner getting to know these elites is a lot easier than getting to know ivy leaguers in the united states ukraine is extremely affordable attractive inexpensive traditional markets and supermarkets of course kyiv is a very inexpensive place to live very bottom of the big mac index the hryvnya exchange rate has fallen threefold since the start of the war in donbass prices have risen especially for imports but not nearly as much the tourist will note that it is still possible to get a decent hotel room for a taxi anywhere in the city for and a meal for under that is just the start for those of us who live here metro ridesbuses and trams are even lessmake life cheap and convenient try the grocery store a pound for potatoes beets carrots onions and cabbage the staples of the ukrainian diet meat is generally under two dollars a pound although there is a lot of hue and cry about corruption in the energy business in the end it costs far less than in the united states a month to heat a house and between four and five dollars a gallon for gasoline however most ukrainians utilities are included in rent and only a few drive cars medical care is a preview of the impending obamacare disaster the state promises the moon but delivers only what it can afford the average ukrainian has to stand in a long line to get indifferent service from underequipped and underpaid doctors in shabby soviet era hospitals the flip side is that feeforservice is alive and well you can get decent care if you pay for it and it doesnt cost very much in fact ukraine is a medical tourism destination especially for fertility treatments plastic surgery and dental work an american social security check makes you rich by local standards it is a good place to live in retirement moreover any american can teach english and there are a number of entrepreneurial opportunities that dont take a lot of capital to start ukrainians are fairly uniformly slavic and they like people like themselves just us slavs western newspapers are full of horror stories about ukraine war and corruption leaders in moscow washington and europe love to point fingers at us to distract from the increasingly blatant corruption surrounding those in the west im no fan of corruption but given the fact that it is universal it is worth relating why ukrainian corruption is more comfortable to live with than that of the europe or the united states there is no hypocrisy about our corruption or rather the hypocrisy is so transparent that nobody believes the lies the virtue we still have free speech ukrainians do not lose their jobs if they are politically incorrect they are not jailed if they say what they think about middle eastern immigration if you tell a woman she looks good she might actually blush and appreciate it the corruption has kept the standard of living low which perversely has important benefits people remain traditional because they have needed the support of families just to survive asylum seeking immigrants dont come because there is nothing here for themfew jobs and nothing in the way of welfare not having immigrants leads to high levels of social capital the people actually like and trust each other i am the only american in our little development of homes they have included me in the groupeverybody knows me and says hello when i meet them on the street in the bus and in the stores in my toney neighborhood of bethesda maryland most neighbors were too occupied with their important jobs to bother being neighborly the fact that it is mostly just slavs has a couple of important corollaries there are no bad neighborhoods in kyiv people will tell you to avoid the troyeshchena but a lot of people i know live there i went to see for myself i had a couple of pleasant shots of vodka chatting with the locals i cannot imagine doing that in the anacostia neighborhood of washington dc people always stand up to give my son and me a seat on the bus or metro old ladies absolutely gush over him and engage him in small talk they support their rising generation and are tickled to death that i am raising him to be a ukrainian lastly even though the locals will tell you otherwise ukrainians are good and polite drivers they invariably stop for you at crosswalks very few will drive after even one drink fatalities per vehicle mile are about twice as high as in the west because the roads are poor but you cant blame it on the drivers young people have pride in themselves an english language toastmasters meeting students and young professionals show selfrestraint no tattoos no piercings no sloppy clothes no swearing very little smoking and no drugs they are what in the s was called squaredelightfully so they look forward to marriage and families especially the women for this reason they are perhaps not as easy as girls elsewhere but when you get one you have something of substance there are lots of places to meet young people needless to say bars and nightclubs there are studios all over town giving inexpensive dance lessonssalsa and swing are bigand hundreds of sports clubs the english language mafia club is thriving the toastmasters public speaking club attracts many of the best and brightest with meetings in english german russian and ukrainian the language exchange club also meets in several languages from may to september the river beaches are great surrounded by restaurants bars and discos ukrainians love to practice their english and welcome foreigners not too many make it this far east it is an easy place to make friends it is a good place to sit out the wests coming civil unrest one of kyivs many lovely river beaches the western press would have you believe that kyiv is a lawless wild west that is the opposite from the truth even today it is safer than any western capital city the first danger cited is vladimir putin when are the russians going to invade answer they wont throughout is history russia has expanded by stealth and opportunity they stopped when finland fought back in and georgia fought back in they swiped the baltics and part of poland only after germany had started a war that diverted the worlds attention they imposed their will on their european satellites only because the red army conveniently occupied them at the end of world war ii in ukraine they took the opportunity of political chaos in to steal crimea where by treaty they already had a large military presence emboldened they thought they had an opportunity in the russianspeaking donbass but the ukrainians resisted and that war is at a standstill putin knows full well that million ethnic russians cannot dominate million ethnic ukrainians especially under the glare of world opinion despite what the neocons may have shouted to sway the us election the russians are not coming another comforting thought is that there is nothing here worth nuking it is a benefit of staying out of nato there is no dependent class here to rise up when economic hardship hits hardship is already here there are no discontented minorities gypsies the most visible of them actually workthey sell flowers and work as junk dealers you cannot be a parasite if there is no blood to suck it is the united states and europe that have legions of restless unemployed who are only being pacified by government benefits and will rise up when governments can no longer afford them ukraines corruption is well understood by everybody as much as they complain people know how to cope with it it may take bribery to get things done but they generally do get done corruption does not result in much violence occasionally some hardnosed judge or a pesky reporter gets bumped off true but in every case the victim could have explained quite clearly why he was targeted it is not like the random killing of whites by blacks in the united states or random islamic terror in western europe ukraine has lots of land excellent agriculture abundant water reasonably good natural resources and a homogeneous and hardworking population it is not as dependent on international trade as most european countries when the world financial system collapses ukraine will come through looking pretty good they are so far down that it all looks like up and the stress lines for civil unrest simply dont exist though you may come here for the love of a wonderful woman you will find it a delightful place to make your home read more ukrainian girls have lost their love for american men,1

chancellor kamran salam from the east coast of canada thank you for taking the time to address this important issue regarding professor hall like yourself we all have been stunned by the voracity of dr mahons action we used to think academics of certain reputation were above the reach of the tentacles of the establishment we all hoped that a president would not resort to such a shameless pandering to a special interest group however bnai brith is not just a special interest group it is perhaps the most vindictive organization that has ever received prominence in the west allow me to elaborate you have correctly identified bnai brith to be behind this movement against shutting down free speech while this statement is accurate this phenomenon of targeting canadian universities and canadian society is not something that started now not too long ago it used to be branded as the hidden hand behind the hidden hand during the harper era this operation became a fullblown politically driven policy directive the legislation that dr mahon pathetically relies upon is a product of the harper era harper had an extremist rightwing background and organizations like bnai brith have channelled that extremism to accomplish their hateful agenda as early as the s i personally observed the spirit of this unholy union during my tenure as the president of muslim student association at the university of alberta although harper didnt attend that university we were not too far from the epicentre of the neoconservatism movement that was brewing in canada we fastforward years and come upon the type of events such as professor hall travesty that are products of that time in fact a web of such operations has been in full force for sometime in every aspect of canadian lives only recently we had this court ruling against canadian security intelligence service that was illegally spying on the public this gangsterlike involvement started in shortly after harper and the neocon came to power this is not to say that the public is protected from such unconscionable manoeuvring under a liberal government in fact the most notorious scandals involving government and human rights have erupted during the liberal regime take for instance the case of omar khadr travesty more creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere irish human rights activists against freedom of speech this case is something we had known albeit too late to intervene at the time and has been subsequently discredited publicly even during the harper regime the overwhelming theme was pointed out by then barely year old omar khadr who said you dont care about me this is what defines the mindset of these people bent on extremism over extremism to subdue public conscience the attack on professor hall was particularly toxic but equally sinister attacks have taken place before some decade ago now defunct canadian islamic congress faced onslaught from all sides based on planted stories and baited manoeuvring it was the largest muslim organization at a time canadian muslims became the largest religious minority one particular episode involved bnai briths planted story involving a university professor who became the target of hate crime while at the same time investigated for hate crime if it wasnt for the humane and civic behaviour of the then university president current governor general david johnston it would have become career threatening if not life threatening event of the professor top university personnel told me in private how the university faced pressure from donors that wanted that professor to disappear from the academic as well as public arena the vendetta of this sort beggars belief even today what we dont know is how many of these assaults on conscience took place and has been brewing clearly some of the faithful memberssympathizers apply it publicly such was the case of former professor turned politician irwin cotler who routinely infected the political arena with his prejudice and bias imported from the academia then there are others such as alan rock of university of ottawa that implanted manoeuvring of the political arena to the academia a third group would be lorna marsden of york university that abused authority to run a vindictive agenda yet others have found every other way possible to target a person of conscience all the meanwhile covering up all trails so the victim cannot point a finger to the attacker and has no recourse to justice or self defence it doesnt matter which category they belong to they all produce scandals and drag down the good name of the academia while agencies that are supposed to be uphold the rights and dignity of the academia stand by and for some cases join in to the atrocity this obscene attack on human rights and academic decency was once brought to light by late professor david noble who ended up suing york university and canadian jewish congress jointly for conspiring against him professor noble a jew himself faced the vilest of subjugation by organizations claiming to promote the rights of jews that wasnt enough dr noble had to take on human rights commission and other agencies that stood by either in complicity or in collusion with the university authority professor noble passed away before the lawsuit could see a day in court but soon university of ottawa would come in the picture with the infamous involvement of alan rock a man without a phd that was at the helm of the university mr rock recently left the universitybut not before leaving the universitys good name in the sewerage of politicking what dr mahon has done is bring this insidious modus operandi to yet another victim had i not have the misfortune of being on the wrong side of this modus operandi in the last years i would almost not understand what is at works here in old days such tactic would be unheardof in a university certainly such things couldnt happen in a civilized country i would exclaim so what happened to professor hall is not new what is new is the waking up of the general public your letter reverberates the emotion of everyone with conscience that came to know about professor hall people are waking up and are beginning to ask for justice for instance in the context of csis an activist jim comeau wrote i would say its time to jail the highest ranking csis to send a clear message to the rest of them do something illegal straight to prison they damn well knew what they were doing was illegal the peoples revulsion to such atrocious maligning of people of conscience was summed up in recent letter of julian assange who wrote on us general election day november yet some weeks ago in a tactic reminiscent of senator mccarthy and the red scare wikileaks green party candidate stein glenn greenwald and clintons main opponent were painted with a broad red brush the clinton campaign when they were not spreading obvious untruths pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with russia the campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publicationsbecause none exists in the end those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them a reason for censorship the first amendment cannot tolerate only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate of course recent events have allowed us to see this in the highest level of politics in the united states to anyone with an iota of conscience there is no mystery here people are making their voice clearly known in the words of claire lanyado i prefer unpredictable to criminal and evil the problem is when a president of university for whatever reason decides to use his position to serve the special interest group deliberately there is no recourse for a professor to fight himher in other cases if such atrocity were launched against a student eg the case of freemanmaloy vs lorna marsden of york university the student an antizionist jew could bring a lawsuit of misfeasance in public office with the help of yet another jewish lawyer peter rosenthal who himself is a university professor of mathematics it was struck down by the court and then it was overruled by the court of appeals at the end the university settled and dr marsden the embattled president was gone the morale of this story is the path to justice is steep but for a professor the path to justice is becoming impossible the irony is that it is the people harboring so much hate who tell others that they are committing hate crimes just because they dare speak out against an atrocity of course they pick their targets that are perceived as weak and vulnerable and they attack the target only after making sure that the target cannot run to anyone for justice thats how extremism works sincerely rafiq islam,0

that almost every malicious liefilled article about herself or he husband was written by a female indeed women seem to have a particular stake in bringing mr trump down the contrast between mrs trump and the many histrionic shrews prosecuting her husband is stark in both her interviews with cnns condescending anderson cooper and fox newss ainsley earhardt mrs trump was the embodiment of strength when a liberal woman declares shes a strong woman usually uttered in a tartlike staccato inflection shes using a cliché look at her actions youll see that strong to liberal distaff means kicking and screaming until she brings others into compliance with her worldview and ways a strong liberal woman is one who hammers you about your obligation to forkout for her trojans and her trivora and if birth control fails our liberated libertine then youre on the hook for her abortions and abortifacients and dont dare doubt any of the intemperate charges leveled by this prototype liberal succubus against a man any man to doubt her is to harm her it was not without significance that hillary clintons first general election speech in june was before planned parenthood at the time media buried the story of one named rajiv k fernando who had donated to the clinton foundation and was given a seat as hillarys nuclear weapons advisor watching this i was thinking endemic corruption the trillion debt the dire jobs report the terrifying prospect of negative interest rates and the fate of savers but hillary and her gynobrigade in media and across the country were cheering for a universal right to taxpayerpaid dilation and curettage dc melania trump on the other hand is authentically strong in her refusal to impart salacious tellall tidbits to interviewers in the way she guards her privacy and that of her family in her serene gracious and beautiful manners and bearingmrs trump exemplifies a european womans good breeding shes a class act her enemies are the cultural underclass nor does mrs trump display any of the histrionics about men exhibited by her american counterparts there are images on the internet of presidents being inappropriate with women in particular you can watch a grainy youtube clip of barack obama appearing to be showing off his crotch to giggling female reporters in another the president with frances nicolas sarkozy is eying the shapely behind of a young woman passing by much to media chagrin melania refused to get worked up about the access hollywood tape in which her husband engaged in lockerroom talk men will be men if theyre not saying it theyre thinking it more material than her mien were melania trumps words of reason on the sovietstyle witchhunt launched against her husband with media mediation she said this all sexual assault allegations should be handled in a court of law to accuse someone man or woman without evidence is damaging and unfair this was the exact verdict of famed defense attorney tom mesereau about the bill cosby pileon quit the feeding frenzy give the man his due process investigate the women counseled mesereau esq at the time the very embodiment of the malevolent liberal matriarchy rising is the sainted michelle

has shaken me to my core in a way i could not have predicted the ritualistic decapitation on the altar of a catholic priest by muslim migrants in france thats something i cant stop thinking about the machinegunning of five macys shoppers and employees by a turkish muslim immigrant arcan cetin in my neck of the woods that has shaken me to my core in a way i could not have predicted again mrs obamas pitiful case against mr trump has strengthened nothing but her dramaqueen credentials candidate clinton crowed that mrs obamas long whinge for women was a compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election about who we are as americans indeed the implicit case michelle put to women is this a mammoth national debt a shrinking job market rising lawlessness and racial strife an annual

the eighth and at some of the things that i think will happen between now and as well as what i think the landscape will look like in the year leading up to that years election it wont be a popular opinion here on ats i am sure but as of today i feel confident in saying that short of some unprecedented and wholly unforseeable revelation or event this years election is very likely a done deal hillary clinton will almost certainly be the next president of the united states with just two weeks remaining before election day as of this writing the metaanalysis of polls shows clinton possessing nearly an insurmountable lead while it is true that trump enjoys a very passionate and enthusiastic base he has done little to successfully expand that base the potential for him to find a means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters is minimal and shrinks with each passing day having come to this view i find myself free to look beyond the coming weeks and to try and get a handle on what a post world will look like frankly gazing into my allegorical crystal ball i see dark and threatening clouds gathering on our horizon clouds that could very well bring a storm of epic proportions our way election night blues the night of tuesday november the eighth could well be historic in the worst of ways this election cycle has broken several taboos and lowered the bar of political discourse in unprecedented ways it has been a season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric that has builtup a great deal of social tension we currently sit atop a very very dry powder keg of anger that is seething and highly volatile passions will be flaring among many as we watch the election results stream in on our televisions computers and phones many of those watching will be deeply deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race in this climactic moment we as a nation will be perilously close to critical mass one spark away from potential disaster four years ago a man with some degree of fame was emotionally invested in that years election and he took to social media twitter to vent his reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion that minor celebrity was one donald j trump source imagine for a moment what could happen if history repeats itself and this same man goes on a similar rant this election night imagine the violence such a display could potentially trigger then stop imagining and take a deep breath such a reaction is not just possible given the evidence it is more than likely the probable outcome trump is currently heavily invested in telling his followers that the election is rigged that they have no voice and that he is the only one who can save them this is a very very dangerous and unstable bit of social chemistry most trump supporters obviously will not lash out in violence if their candidate loses the race even if they personally feel that the outcome of the election was not legitimate however some trump supporters those in the extremes of what the media is currently calling the alt right very well could take to the streets in rage given some of the fringe support that trump enjoys i would honestly be surprised if such things were not already being planned by a handful of those on the fringe the rhetoric of revolution has been abused of late and there are always the few who take such statements far too literally across the line blunty put if election night comes and trump loses and if he takes to twitter as he did four years ago it could well result in a very long and bloody night a catastrophic night that we will look back upon with shame a night that could well poison our nation for years to come much ado about trump tv many pundits and wonks have mused over the fact that it truly does appear that trump has been laying the groundwork for a future media operation presumably a news network or service of some kind i count myself among those who have been suggesting so for a fairly long time however where i differ is that i dont see it as being quite so cut and dry any longer while i do think that trumps original thoughts or more the thoughts of those who influence trump was to create a new media conservative news venue i think that its now grown into something more i think that trump tv or whatever they end up calling it trump tv is too generic theres no inherent propaganda value in the name i think something more like trumps maga network is probably more on point will be used as a device to begin a new political party more accurately to succeed where others have previously failed im looking at you sarah palin and glenn beck by congealing the various patriot tea party and fringe right wing groups into one collective and singular entity a party firmly rooted in extreme nationalism with enough religion and conservatism thrown in to gain wider appeal my prediction is that donald trump will remain the focal point and figurehead of this coming movement using this new network much as he currently utilizes his twitter feed a platform for him to vent his late night frustrations angers and insecurities his name will be predominantly used in the branding and messaging and trump will be the face of it all the most frequent speaker and guest imagine if the apprentice had been a live streaming show and trump had the power to walk in at any moment to say whatever happened to be on his mind that is how i see trump tv however i dont see trump being the driving force behind the actual message trump is a brand after all he has made his place in this world by putting his name on buildings he didnt build shows that he didnt create and ideas he didnt originate trump works as a spokesperson the guy who says im not only the president of but im also a member the real people behind the curtain will be the mercers robert and rebekah steve bannon and to a lesser degree roger ailes as for on camera talents i think the current obvious potential faces of this new media enterprise will be hannity oreilly and lahren though im honestly not personally sure if oreilly will make the jump money is money after all and big daddy bill is sitting pretty comfortably atop the fox news heap as his career winds down regardless however of who wins the backstage power war other than the mercers who are a lock and the on camera positions the network itself will be the propaganda arm of the extreme right wing and i think it very well could end up pulling the national discourse much further to the right in the coming years particularly with the subjects of national isolationism and national identity politics,0

battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print dr eric walsh photo first liberty the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church but dr eric walsh is resisting issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons walshs ordeal began in may when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency only a week later a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventhday adventist church lee rudd the agencys human resources director then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately two days later walsh was fired at that point lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks chesin walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the constitution

an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church said jeremy dys senior counsel for first liberty no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so officials with the georgia department of health

display of support on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile filthy blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen the mayor at the time annise parker withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest in a prepared statement wednesday on walshs case welch said i cant believe im saying this but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded different categories of materials including sermons from us welch the executive director of the texas pastor council said what is happening to walsh is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons first this is state government coming after a pastor not just a rogue mayor in one city he said also the state is demanding much more material sermons sermon notes all documents without even topical or time limits it could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching bible its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study this sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor every church every denomination and every citizen of faith in america leaders of concerned women for america legislative action committee part of the nations largest public policy womens group with members also came to walshs defense penny nance ceo said the words of reverend dr martin luther king jr that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere still reverberate today especially as we witness the gestapolike tactics of his native state the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom as they discriminate against another pastor dr eric walsh is indeed a threat to every american whatever our religious beliefs can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor examine and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed walshs sermons and then fired him no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon dys told fox news when the case was filed he was fired for something he said in a sermon if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything the original state investigation of walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist state officials also joked about informing walsh of his firing the telephone call was between dr patrick oneal an agency official and kate pfirman an agency financial officer the call was captured on an answering machine which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up pfirman said and im gonna be very im gonna try to come off as very cold because i dont want to say very much if i try to make it warm ive thought that through its gonna just not theres no warm way to say it anyway then there was laughter from both parties oneal then said to inform walsh youre out and there was another round of laughter its very funny pfirman said the voicemail in the houston dispute voters ultimately soundly rejected parkers ordinance giving gays and transgendered people special rights,1

actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled democrats should ask clinton to step aside so what should the democrats do now if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process they would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article i included a quote from a us news world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are committee members a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold spots for selection by states along with an optional slots dnc members can choose to fill but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee who would they choose lets take a look at the top five options tim kaine he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee joe biden vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice bernie sanders bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list elizabeth warren elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman so she is definitely a possibility but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies michelle obama one recent survey found that percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from to so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the campaign in a recent msn article entitled in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely

below antitrump violence is already sweeping the nation if trump were to actually win the election that would likely send the radical left into a violent postelection temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before alternatively there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by hillary clinton and as i showed yesterday it appears that voting machines in texas are already switching votes from donald trump to hillary clinton if hillary clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country at this moment there is less than two weeks to go until november th and a brand new survey has found that a majority of americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day a majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on election day one in five are very concerned three of four say they have confidence that the united states will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked american democracy for more than years but just say they are very confident about that more than four in of trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of clinton as president if she prevails because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square but many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence on wednesday donald trumps star on the walk of fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pickax donald trump took a lot of hits today and not just in the presidential race with less than two weeks to go before america decides if the ex apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over hillary clinton trumps star on the hollywood walk of fame was destroyed early wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a tinseltown first and there were two other instances earlier this year when donald trumps star was also vandalized one came in january and the other happened in june this is of course not the first time the gop candidates star has been attacked or defaced since trump announced his white house bid in summer the most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at hollywood blvd in late january in june this summer a mute sign was painted on trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign in both cases trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day we have seen antitrump violence on the east coast as well earlier this month someone decided to firebomb the republican party headquarters in orange county north carolina on the building next to the headquarters someone spraypainted nazi republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika there have also been other disturbing incidents of antitrump violence all over the nation in recent days a recent lifezette article put together quite a long list and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece on oct in bangor maine vandals spraypainted about parked cars outside a trump rally trump supporter paul foster whose van was hit with white paint told reporters why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars all of this to make their statement around oct a couple of trump supporters were assaulted in zeitgeist a san francisco bar after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for trump gotnews reports the two trump supporters were attacked punched and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back lilian kim of abc bay area tweeted a

trump supporter feras jabro for wearing a make america great again baseball cap the assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app periscope there is a move to get trump supporters to wear red on election day but in many parts of america that might just turn his supporters into easy targets lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad and a hillary clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge for example this week former congressman joe walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if donald trump loses the election former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald

phone interview after being surveyed the trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election today america is more divided than i have ever seen it before and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another ironically donald trump has been working very hard to bring america together in fact he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any republican presidential candidate since if hillary clinton and the democrats win on november th things will not go well for hillary clintons political enemies the clintons used the power of the white house to go after their enemies the first time around and hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then and the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are this is something that i discussed on national television earlier this month as i write this it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a hillary clinton presidency would be but at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome out of all the candidates that we could have chosen the american people are about to put the most evil one by far into the white house perhaps donald trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate but time is rapidly slipping away and

imperative that hillary be defeated if the people choose hillary then they must and will be punished wikileaks bill clinton boasts of hillarys working relationship with muslim brotherhood by john hayward breitbart october in a speech bill clinton gave at the home of mehul and hema sanghani in october revealed to the public for the first time by wikileaks former president bill clinton touted hillary clintons working relationship with the muslim brotherhoods mohamed morsi in egypt as an example of her diplomatic skillspresident clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the iran nuclear deal in a passage that began with the standard democrat stuff happens shrugging defense for foreign policy failures finally we live in a world as i said thats full of good news and bad news the united states cannot control it all but we need a president whos most likely to make as many good things happen as possible and most likely to prevent big bad things from happening you cant keep every bad thing from happening whos most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way even the people who dont like the iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadnt been for the sanctions hillary negotiated those sanctions and got china and russia to sign off something i thought shed never be able to do i confess im never surprised by anything she does but that surprised me i didnt think she could do it the chinese and the russians to see past their shortterm selfinterest to their longterm interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race and when the muslim brotherhood took over in egypt in spite of the fact that we were inaudible she developed a working relationship with the thenpresident and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a fullscale shooting war between israel and hamas in gaza which on top of what was going on in syria and the inaudible jordan would have been a calamity for the world and when we were trying to reset our relations with russia under president medvedev she and her team negotiated a new start treaty which limits warheads and missiles and she lobbied it through the senate she had to get votes which means a lot of these republicans who say that they dont like her now are just kidding for election season they trusted her and she got it passed you cant get votes in the senate without a lot of republican support and i dont know about you but with all this tension and mr putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in syria i think its a very good thing that were in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the russians she did that youll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the iran debacle than bill clinton boasting that the sanctions barack obama lifted were superawesome as even those who dont think those sanctions should have been lifted agree mr clintons version of the iran sanctions leaves out a few details such as russias keen financial interest in keeping iranian energy out of the european market and chinas desire to use iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip but the part about the muslim brotherhood is most interesting if anything he is selling hillary clintons working relationship with egyptian islamists short because she used american diplomatic leverage for morsis benefit even before he got elected warning egyptians about backtracking to a military regime at a key moment of the postmubarak campaign when morsi was running against a former member of hosni mubaraks military there have long been rumors that more subtle forms of us pressure were used to secure morsis office as well then again in public pronouncements clinton called hosni mubaraks tottering regime stable and cautioned her obama administration colleagues against pushing a longtime partner out the door a few days ago declassified state department documents revealed clintons talking points for a meeting with morsi hailed his election as a milestone in egypts transition to democracy and stated that she was to offer the muslim brotherhood leader technical expertise and assistance from both the us government and private sector to support his economic and social programs clinton was also supposed to privately offer morsi assistance with his police and security forces which would be conducted quite discreetly after morsi was gone she declared herself exasperated with egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical realist that is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the obama administration was saying while the arab spring was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but americaaligned or at least americafearing regimes which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long as for clintons superb working relationship with morsi that eventually ended with morsis wife railing against clinton for supposedly dismissing him as a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency and threatening to publish letters from clinton to morsi that would damage the former us secretary of state meanwhile mohammed morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the egyptian penitentiary system egypt has one of those icky military governments again and while it wont have fond memories of hillary clintons support for the muslim brotherhood regime it will most likely work with whoever wins the us presidential election therefore a prospective president hillary clinton probably wont suffer too much from secretary of state hillary clintons appalling lapses in

interrogated and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock john vibes september comments irving tx an intelligent and talented th grader was arrested this week for bringing a homemade clock into school yearold ahmed mohamed is interested in electronics and has taught himself how to make his own radios and other devices he can even repair his own gokart recently he made a clock that he was proud of so he decided to take it into school and show his classmates and teachers sadly instead of celebrating his achievement one of his teachers called the police on him because they thought that it might be a bomb when the police arrived they took the threat seriously and believed that it could be a bomb as well even though it obviously wasnt eventually the police charged him with making a clock and misrepresenting it as a bomb even though he consistently told everyone that it was a clock and denied that it was a bomb when the teachers or the police suggested it the young man was then handcuffed and taken to a juvenile detention center and his clock was taken and put in an evidence room he was also suspended from school and was unable to attend a student council meeting that he was scheduled to be a part of here in high school none of the teachers know what i can do ahmed told dallas news after the incident he then explained that when he showed his engineering teacher what he created he was warned not to show it to the other teachers he was like thats really nice i would advise you not to show any other teachers ahmed said he then kept the clock in his bag until his english class when the alarm went off and disturbed his teacher after the class ahmed showed his teacher what was making the noise and she accused him of bringing a bomb to school she was like it looks like a bomb he said i told her it doesnt look like a bomb to me he explained the teacher took the clock from him and he had expected that was the end of it however towards the end of the day ahmed was pulled out of class and taken to a room filled with police officers he said that the officers then attempted to get him to admit that he tried to make a bomb they were like so you tried to make a bomb ahmed said i told them no i was trying to make a clock the officer then told him it looks like a movie bomb to me the police even admit that ahmed never once said the device was a bomb and they never had any reason to believe that it actually was one but the police still seemed to think he was lying about something even though they didnt have any proof we have no information that he claimed it was a bomb he kept maintaining it was a clock but there was no broader explanation police spokesman james mclellan said it could reasonably be mistaken as a device if left in a bathroom or under a car the concern was what was this thing built for do we take him into custody he added they couldnt possibly imagine that a young man would want to teach himself a valuable skill and share his achievement with his teachers they thought how could someone like this build something like this unless its a threat ahmed said ahmeds father mohamed elhassan mohamed believes that his family is being discriminated against he just wants to invent good things for mankind but because his name is mohamed and because of sept i think my son got mistreated he said there has since been an outpour of support on social media since ahmeds story went public he has even gotten support from mark z and president obama cool clock ahmed want to bring it to the white house we should inspire more kids like

turns into dog killing spree innocent woman shot at toddler terrorized matt agorist august comments buffalo ny in their relentless and often violent pursuit to control what citizens can and cannot put in their bodies the state leaves behind a trail of blood and suffering as the buffalo police department illustrated last week this trail often contains the blood of defenseless animals police incompetence coupled with deadly training came to a head last week and wreaked havoc on the residents of buffalo the narcotics division of the buffalo police department executed a series of drug raids last week leading to a handful of arrests and the seizure of small quantities of drugs mostly cannabis after the department released their heroic numbers to the press on how much dangerous cannabis was taken off the streets they remained conveniently silent about the dogs they slaughtered along the way on friday morning buffalo cops in their search for a lb black male raided the home of michael urban a lb white male while police were ramming the innocent mans face into his kitchen floor urban pleaded with them not to kill his dog but it was to no avail police took aim at the helpless dog who according to urban was simply standing there in a nonthreatening manner boom one officer fired but the bullet only injured urbans monthold pit bull named gotham sending him running away frightened and crying as the dog is wailing in agony another officer fires a round directly into the dogs skull exploding the innocent animals head but it gets worse urban lives on the second floor of an apartment when the second officer shot that bullet went through the floor and almost killed the tenant downstairs what just happened urban recalls as the bullet hole went through the floor through the ceiling as the dogs blood is dripping through the downstairs apartment whos accountable as gothams blood drips from the bullet hole in urbans floor and out of the hole of jami krafchaks ceiling in the apartment below cops decided to go after her too after they nearly killed her cops raided krafchaks home she was manhandled searched with no warrant and humiliated as she stood there in her nightgown neither urban nor krafchak were charged with a crime the night before the heroic cops of the buffalo narcotics division killed an innocent mans beloved pet they raided the home of cory and cindy meer according to meers lawyer matthew albert meer and his twoyearold son watched helplessly as jackboots murdered their beloved family dog damian a sixyearold pit bull meer tells artvoice that his dog was not a threat to officers he is the most family friendly dog ive ever had hes never hurt anyone said meer he would have licked the cops just like urban meer lied face down as he begged the cops not to shoot damian again this was to no avail as meers yearold watched in horror a cop blasted the family dog to death my son lost his best friend right in front of him meer said also like urban meer was not arrested however a friend at his house allegedly had a small amount of marijuana on him so the raid was justified according to police according to meers attorney he has active cases of dogs being killed by the same squad they are going to say they are going after dangerous drug dealers albert said out of the cases i have theyve hit the wrong houses numerous times found nothing numerous times and i think at best theyve found a few pills at one of these houses charges i got dismissed because they were filed wrong in the free thought project reported on a freedom of information act request for use of force incidents within the buffalo police department the information was shocking according to use of force reports buffalo police shot dogs from jan through sept seventythree of those dogs died nineteen survived to provide a comparison buffalos numbers more than triple the amount of dog shooting incidents involving police in cincinnati a municipality of similar size the numbers are what the numbers are buffalo police chief of detectives dennis richards said in an interview with wgrz in certainly no officer takes any satisfaction in having to dispatch a dog apparently however they do it is not like buffalo residents have more dogs than other parts of the country this department seemingly takes satisfaction in killing peoples dogs when asked if the buffalo police have undergone any special training in regards to dealing with dogs or the handling of dogs in a nonlethal manner chief richards said it has not come to that point in buffalo that weve implemented any of those other techniques apparently killing a dog every other week or two in a hour period is just dandy and they see no problem with it or reason to seek out training to deal with such a high rate of puppycide something has to be done however and it is far more than just training the most effective action that would need to be taken would be to drastically reduce the instance of noknock search warrants according to an aclu report percent of swat raids are searches for drugs if we want to end puppycide we have to end the drug war the two are not mutually exclusive matt agorist is an honorably

waiting for justice from a killing of his dog on a wrong address raid wtf are the judges in buffalo doing handing out noknock search warrants for refer with the track record of buffalo narcotics noknock search warrants this is the real crime the words search warrant cant even apply in these cases its more like an execution warrant the only acceptable cause to conduct a raid especially on a civilian residence is if there is a hostage situation no hostage no raid common sense so a bunch of steroid junkies have to miss out on playing war games with civilian lives well too bad we can call that an acceptable loss mike i hope and pray that everyone of these thug cops that shot dogs get shot themselves and left to bleed out in the gutter like the trash they truly are gordon klock they clearly get some nonadmitted sense of satisfaction by killing peoples pets in front of them we all are coming to know that there is absolutely no reasoning with these sadistic clowns the war on drugs has always been a scam to generate prison labor terrorize the populace whilst maintaining the naive illusion that it is all somehow morally responsible behavior to harm incarcerate people over such an exaggerated threat more likely to oneself if at all they really seem to enjoy scaring the helpless as they commit these acts of brutality that wouldve been illegal for them to do three or four decades ago katz ro tried to twitter you a link this is all on video personally i feel felony charges should be lodged against any lea that comes to someones home and shoots their dog for no reason,1

calling for a revolution in the streets and i believe that they are quite serious by michael snyder on november th the surprise victory by donald trump on november th has spawned a series of violent protests and riots all over the nation as stunned leftists continue to throw the largest postelection temper tantrum in us history protesters in large cities all across america have been disrupting public transportation looting stores hurling objects at the police and burning trump in effigy there have even been shootings at antitrump rallies in seattle and in portland hundreds of protesters have been arrested so far and organizers are promising that this is only just the beginning meanwhile large numbers of enraged leftists are physically threatening trump on twitter and some are even calling for a violent revolution sadly i believe that they are quite serious about this even some big celebrity names are starting to use the word revolution in messages to their followers on twitter katy perry has ominously warned that the revolution is coming and comedian sarah silverman has boldly declared that trump gets a chance to hear us or else we r them if he fails revolution in the streets of course other leftists are seeking less violent ways to oppose trump there is a major push to use the electoral college to block a trump presidency if that fails there are many hoping to immediately impeach trump once he takes office and other activists such as former labor secretary robert reich are calling for a new third party if their planned postelection takeover of the democratic party is not successful but for many on the radical left the time for patience is over the not my president movement is taking off like a rocket and one survey found that only percent of all clinton supporters consider trumps victory to be legitimate a protest near trump tower in new york city on saturday drew approximately people and usa today reported that the antitrump protest in portland oregon on saturday night rapidly devolved into a riot it is becoming clear that these protests are not going away any time soon and some are even beginning to refer to this movement as the purple revolution no sooner had trump been declared the th president of the united states sorosfunded political operations launched their activities to disrupt trump during obamas lameduck period and thereafter the swiftness of the purple revolution is reminiscent of the speed at which protesters hit the streets of kiev the ukrainian capital in two orange revolutions sponsored by soros one in and the other ten years later in as the clintons were embracing purple in new york street demonstrations some violent all coordinated by the sorosfunded moveonorg and black lives matter broke out in new york los angeles chicago oakland nashville cleveland washington austin seattle philadelphia richmond st paul kansas city omaha san francisco and some other cities across the united states so could we actually see a violent revolution on the streets of america is the radical left really so horrified by the prospect of a trump presidency that they would actually be willing to engage in a prolonged campaign of chaos violence and physical intimidation well the oath keepers are so concerned about what this movement could become that they have initiated an intelligence gathering operation that they are calling operation hypo clearly as oath keepers we cannot simply sit around and watch while the enemies of liberty work to use violence to initiate a communist revolution in our country as a result of the intelligence being provided by our operation sabot operatives we have initiated operation hypo we have allowed our personnel to burrow deep inside these protest organizations to collect information regarding tactics motivations schedules and logistics we had operatives at the planning meetings for the protests that occurred last evening in baltimore md and philadelphia pa our operatives have also penetrated numerous other planning organizations in cities across the country for opsec reasons the precise list of cities we are operating in will not be publicly disclosed and one thing that we already know is that the radical left is hoping to organize the largest political protest in united states history in washington dc on inauguration day i will be writing about this later today on the most important news the election of donald trump has been the single most galvanizing event for the radical left that we have seen in decades one of the early leaders of the not my president movement is filmmaker michael moore and the following are three of his key action points which he feels must be implemented immediately must quickly and decisively form an opposition movement the likes of which hasnt been seen since the s i will do my part to help lead this as im sure many others bernie elizabeth warren moveon the hiphop community dfa etc will too the core of this opposition force will be fueled by young people who as with occupy wall street and black lives matter dont tolerate bs and are relentless in their resistance to authority they have no interest in compromising with racists and misogynists prepare to impeach trump just as the republicans were already planning to do with president hillary from day one we must organize the apparatus that will bring charges against him when he violates his oath and breaks the law and then we must remove him from office must commit right now to a vigorous fight including civil disobedience if necessarywhich will block any and all donald trump supreme court nominees who do not meet our approval we demand the democrats in the senate aggressively filibuster any nominees who support citizens united or who oppose the rights of women immigrants and the poor this is nonnegotiable but of course other liberals are still in the shock and disbelief stage as i have stated before americans were more emotionally invested in this election than they had been in any election in decades and the aftermath has not been pretty this has been particularly true on college campuses all over the nation according to the new york post college administrators have been going to extraordinary lengths to soothe the deep emotional pain that many of their students are experiencing the university of michigan offered its traumatized students coloring books and playdoh to calm them are its students in college or kindergarten the university of kansas reminded its stressedout kids that therapy dogs a regular campus feature were available cornell university an ivy league school held a campuswide cryin with officials handing out tissues and hot chocolate tufts university offered its devastated students arts and crafts sessions ok not kindergarten more like summer camp at campuses from elite yale to connecticut to iowa and beyond professors canceled classes andor exams either because students asked or because instructors were too distraught to teach and it is also being reported that suicide hotlines are ringing off the hook all over the nation we have never seen anything like this ever before and i have a feeling that this not my president movement is going to absolutely dwarf the occupy wall street and black lives matter movements and considering the very high levels of anger frustration and pain that these radical leftists are feeling it is easy to see how this movement could become very violent many patriots conservatives and christians were hoping that donald trump could bring america together

rulings a statement about the prosecutions failure to prove the fundamental elements of a conspiracy charge the fulltime marylhurst university business administration student was the juror who had sent a note to the judge on the fourth day of the initial jurys deliberations in the case questioning the impartiality of a fellow juror no who the judge bounced from the jury a day later it should be known that all jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove conspiracy in the count itself and not any form of affirmation of the defenses various beliefs actions or aspirations juror wrote friday in a lengthy email to the oregonianoregonlive he expressed relief that he can now speak out freely but he wasnt ready as of friday morning to drop his anonymity he said his studies have suffered since the trial started and hes not ready for the attention revealing his identity would bring but felt it was important to defend the verdict the judge withheld jurors names during the jury selection process and trial instead referring to each by number the jury closely followed us district judge anna j browns instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence and testimony heard during the fiveweek trial he said the jury returned unanimous verdicts of not guilty to conspiracy charges against all seven defendants each was accused of conspiring to prevent employees of the us fish and wildlife service and bureau of land management from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force during the day occupation juror noted the panel couldnt simply rely on the defendantsdefining actions to convict all agreed that impeding existed even if as an effect of the occupation he wrote but we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings rather to decide if any agreement was made with an illegal object in mind the marylhurst student wrote it seemed this basic high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout prosecutors had argued that the case at its core was about the illegal taking of anothers property the heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the day takeover in and of itself was intimidating and prevented officers from the us fish and wildlife service and us bureau of land management from carrying out their work they said they argued that the alleged conspiracy began nov when ammon bundy and ally ryan payne met with harney county sheriff dave ward and promised there would be extreme civil unrest in the community if he didnt step in and block harney county ranchers dwight hammond jr and steven hammond the hammonds were slated to return to federal prison on jan and serve out a mandatory minimum fiveyear sentence for arson on federal land defense lawyers urged jurors in closing arguments not to mixup the effect of the occupation which undoubtedly kept federal employees from doing their jobs from the intent of the occupiers five of the seven defendants including ammon bundy testified many said that they were there to protest in support of the hammonds and federal government overreach because they received absolutely no response from state or local government officials to their previous efforts to spur change the defense lawyers arguments coupled with the jury instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence resonated with jurors juror noted inference while possibly compelling proved to be insulting or inadequate to diversely situated people as a means to convict the juror wrote the air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us nor was it warranted given their burden of proof juror plainly stated that fellow juror during the initial round of deliberations had zero business being on this jury in the first place juror had worked for the us bureau of land management as a ranch tech and firefighter more than years ago he had said during jury selection asked by the judge during voir dire if that experience would impede his ability to be a fair and impartial judge of the facts he said not really juror explained why he didnt alert the court immediately after he had heard juror on day one of deliberations reportedly say i am very biased it wasnt until the fourth day into deliberations that juror sent a note to the court asking if a juror who had worked previously for the federal land management agency and outright told the panel he was very biased could be an impartial judge the court flummoxed by the development a day later dismissed juror for good cause after the prosecution and defense teams agreed to the dismissal at the time parties to the case werent sure which way juror s alleged bias fell juror said he resisted the impulse to send the question sooner in an effort to give his fellow juror a chance to explain himself in his email to the oregonianoregonlive juror for the first time also contended that juror violated the judges explicit orders by hearkening to evidence that was never admitted in this case refused to consider the defendants state of mind and used imaginative theories to explain key actions juror said though he wishes that he had sent the letter on day one since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us the maryville business student said he is baffled by what he described as observersflippant sentiments in the wake of the jurys acquittals dont they know that not guilty does not mean innocent he wrote it was not lost on us that our verdicts might inspire future actions that are regrettable but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us the jury he said met with judge brown after the verdicts were announced and after the us marshals physical confrontation and arrest of bundy lawyer marcus mumford he said many of the jurors questioned the judge about why the federal government chose the conspiracy charge he said he learned that a potential alternate charge such as criminal trespass wouldnt have brought as significant a penalty the charge of conspiring to impede federal employees from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force brings a maximum sentence of six years in prison we all queried about alternative charges that could stick and were amazed that this conspiracy charge seemed the best possible option juror said maxine

of the fascist imperialists to reduce to silence all those who resist them and to reinforce the ranks of those whose who have been brainwashed the term conspiracy theorist was developed by the cia in

chair of the house banking and currency committee during the twenties he used his position in congress occasionally to crusade against the federal reserve mr chairman we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known i refer to the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks the federal reserve board a government board has cheated the government of the united states out of enough money to pay the national debt the depredations and the iniquities of the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks acting together have cost this country enough money to pay the national debt several times over this evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the united states has bankrupted itself and has practically bankrupted our government it has done this through defects of the law under which it operates through the maladministration of that law by the federal reserve board and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it louis t mcfadden june at one point mcfadden started impeachment proceedings against the entire board of the federal reserve not too surprisingly there were three attempts on mcfaddens life one shooting and two poisonings the second of which was cuccessful although still officially declared as heart failure newspapers of the time reported now that this sterling american patriot has made the passing it can be revealed that not long after his public utterance against the encroaching powers of judah it became known among his intimates that he had suffered two attacks against his life the first attack came in the form of two revolver shots fired at him from ambush as he was alighting from a cab in front of one of the capital hotels fortunately both shots missed him the bullets burying themselves in the structure of the cab he became violently ill after partaking of food at a political banquet at washington his life was only saved from what was subsequently announced as a poisoning by the presence of a physician friend at the banquet who at once procured a stomach pump and subjected the congressman to emergency treatment president john f kennedy president john f kennedy as president john f kennedy understood the predatory nature of private central banking he understood why andrew jackson fought so hard to end the second bank of the united states so kennedy wrote and signed executive order which ordered the us treasury to issue a new public currency the united states note kennedys united states note click for larger kennedys united states notes were not borrowed from the federal reserve but created by the us government and backed by the silver stockpiles held by the us government it represented a return to the system of economics the united states had been founded on and was perfectly legal for kennedy to do all told some four and one half billion dollars went into public circulation eroding interest payments to the federal reserve and loosening their control over the nation five months later john f kennedy was assassinated in dallas texas and the united states notes pulled from circulation and destroyed except for samples held by collectors john j mccloy john j mccloy president of the chase manhattan bank and president of the world bank was named to the warren commission presumably to make certain the banking dimensions behind the assassination were concealed from the public kennedys eo has never been repealed and is still in effect although no modern president dares to use it almost all of the current national debt has been created since as we enter the eleventh year of what future history will most certainly describe as world war three we need to examine the financial dimensions behind the wars towards the end of world war two when it became obvious that the allies were going to win and dictate the post war environment the major world economic powers met at bretton woods a luxury resort in new hampshire in july of and hammered out the bretton woods agreement for international finance the british pound lost its position as the global trade and reserve currency to the us dollar part of the price demanded by roosevelt in exchange for the us entry into the war absent the economic advantages of being the worlds goto currency britain was forced to nationalize the bank of england in the bretton woods agreement ratified in in addition to making the dollar the global reserve and trade currency obligated the signatory nations to tie their currencies to the dollar the nations that ratified bretton woods did so on two conditions the first was that the federal reserve would refrain from overprinting the dollar as a means to loot real products and produce from other nations in exchange for ink and paper basically an imperial tax that assurance was backed up by the second requirement which was that the us dollar would always be convertible to gold at per ounce the bretton woods resort new hampshire the federal reserve being a private bank and not answerable to the us government did start overprinting paper dollars and much of the perceived prosperity of the s and s was the result of foreign nations obligations to accept the paper notes as being worth gold at the rate of an ounce then in france looked at the huge pile of paper notes sitting in their vaults for which real french products like wine and cheese had been traded and notified the united states government that they would exercise their option under bretton woods to return the paper notes for gold at the per ounce exchange rate the united states had nowhere near the gold to redeem the paper notes by the imf estimated foreign central banks held billion us dollars however the united states had only billion in gold to redeem those paper notes so on august th richard nixon temporarily suspended the gold convertibility of the us federal reserve notes nixon announces the end of gold convertability later termed the nixon shock this move effectively ended bretton woods and many global currencies started to delink from the us dollar the nixon shock worse since the united states had collateralized their loans with the nations gold reserves it quickly became apparent that the us government did not in fact have enough gold to cover the outstanding debts foreign nations began to get very nervous about their loans to the us and understandably were reluctant to loan any additional money to the united states without some form of collateral so richard nixon started the environmental movement with the epa and its various programs such as wilderness zones roadless areas heritage rivers wetlands all of which took vast areas of public lands and made them off limits to the american people who were technically the owners of those lands but nixon had little concern for the environment and the real purpose of this land grab under the guise of the environment was to pledge those pristine lands and their vast mineral resources as collateral on the national debt the plethora of different programs was simply to conceal the true scale of how much american land was being pledged to foreign lenders as collateral on the governments debts eventually almost of the nation itself all of this is illegal as the enclave clause of the constitution limits the federal government to owning the land under federal government buildings and military bases and that enclave clause was written into the constitution by the founding fathers specifically to prevent the federal government simply seizing the land belonging to the people to sell off pledge as collateral or rent click for full size image with open lands for collateral already in short supply the us government embarked on a new program to shore up sagging international demand for the dollar the united states approached the worlds oil producing nations mostly in the middle east and offered them a deal in exchange for only selling their oil for dollars the united states would guarantee the military safety of those oilrich nations the oil rich nations would agree to spend and invest their us paper dollars inside the united states in particular in us treasury bonds redeemable through the slave labor of future generations of us taxpayers the concept was labeled the petrodollar in effect the us no longer able to back the dollar with gold was now backing it with oil other peoples oil and that necessity to keep control over those oil nations to prop up the dollar has shaped americas foreign policy in the region ever since but as americas manufacturing and agriculture has declined the oil producing nations faced a dilemma those piles of us federal reserve notes were not able to purchase much from the united states because the united states had little other than real estate anyone wanted to buy europes cars and aircraft were superior and less costly while experiments with gmo food crops led to nations refusing to buy us food exports israels constant belligerence against its neighbors caused them to wonder if the us could actually keep their end of the petrodollar arrangement oil producing nations started to talk of selling their oil for whatever currency the purchasers chose to use saddam hussein and the lie of iraqs nuclear weapons saddam hussein iraq already hostile to the united states following desert storm demanded the right to sell their oil for euros in and in the united nations agreed to allow it under the oil for food program instituted following desert storm one year later the united states reinvaded iraq under the lie of saddams nuclear weapons lynched saddam hussein and placed iraqs oil back on the world market only for us dollars the clear us policy shift following away from being an impartial broker of peace in the mideast to one of unquestioned support for israels aggressions only further eroded confidence in the petrodollar deal and even more oil producing nations started openly talking of oil trade for other global currencies gaddafi and the gold dinar gaddafi over in libya muammar gaddafi had instituted a stateowned central bank and a value based trade currency the gold dinar the gold dinar gaddafi announced that libyas oil was for sale but only for the gold dinar other african nations seeing the rise of the gold dinar and the euro even as the us dollar continued its inflationdriven decline flocked to the new libyan currency for trade this move had the potential to seriously undermine the global hegemony of the dollar french president nicolas sarkozy reportedly went so far as to call libya a threat to the financial security of the world so the united states invaded libya brutally murdered qaddafi the object lesson of saddams lynching not being enough of a message apparently imposed a private central bank and returned libyas oil output to dollars only the gold that was to have been made into the gold dinars tons of it is as of last report unaccounted for update emails surfacing as part of the investigation into hilary clintons use of a private email server for classified information confirm that the real reason for the us invasion of libya was to destroy the threat of the gold dinar becoming a panafrican currency displacing the dollar general wesley clark blows the whistle on us plans to conquer the oilrich middle east according to general wesley clark the master plan for the dollarification of the worlds oil nations included seven targets iraq syria lebanon libya somalia sudan and iran venezuela which dared to sell their oil to china for the yuan is a late addition what is notable about the original seven nations originally targeted by the us is that none of them are members of the bank for international settlements the private central bankers private central bank located in switzerland this meant that these nations were deciding for themselves how to run their nations economies rather than submit to the international private banks update emails from secretary of state hillary clinton released as part of the benghazi investigation confirm that the true motive for the attack on libya was to control the libyan oil reserves and to destroy libyas goldbacked currency now the bankers gun sights are on iran which dares to have a government central bank and sell their oil for whatever currency they choose the war agenda is as always to force irans oil to be sold only for us dollars and to force them to accept a privately owned central bank malaysia one of the few remaining nations without a rothschild central bank is now being invaded by a force claimed to be al qaeda and has suffered numerous suspicious losses of its commercial passenger jets with the death of president hugo chavez plans to impose a us and banker friendly regime on venezuela are clearly being implemented so just where is the gold germanys gold bullion where is it the german government recently asked for the return of some of their gold bullion from the bank of france and the new york federal reserve france has said it will take years to return germanys gold the united states has said they will need years to return germanys gold this suggests strongly that the bank of france and the ny federal reserve have used the deposited gold for other purposes most likely to cover gold futures contracts used to artificially suppress the price of gold to keep investors in the equities markets and the central banks are scrambling to find new gold to cover the shortfall and prevent a gold run so it is inevitable that suddenly france invades mali ostensibly to combat al qaeda with the us joining in mali just happens to be one of the worlds largest gold producers with gold accounting for of mali exports war for the bankers does not get more obvious than that mexico has demanded a physical audit of their gold bullion stored at the bank of england and along with venezuelas vast oil reserves larger than saudi arabia venezuelas gold mines are a prize lusted after by all the central banks that played fast and loose with other peoples gold bullion so we can expect regime change if not outright invasion soon can a bank foreclose on your house if they have provided nothing of real value in the mortgage a little remembered footnote in banking history occurred in december a bank was moving to foreclose on a house and the homeowner decided to fight the foreclosure in court arguing that contract law requires two contracting parties to agree to swap two items of value legally called the consideration in the case of first national bank of montgomery vs jerome daly daly argued that since the bank simply wrote a number in a ledger to create the loaned money out of think air there was no real value and therefore no legally binding consideration the lawyers for the bank admitted that this is how the bank works they create money out of thin air as a ledger or computer entry which you must repay with your labor and there was no law in that specifically gave banks the legal right to do that daly argued that because there was no equal consideration the mortgage was null and void and the attempt to foreclose invalid the jury agreed so did judge mahoney who resisted demands to overrule the jury in favor of the bank and wrote a simple streightforward decision that stated that there was no question that the mortgage contract was void because the claim that the bank simply made up the money out of thin air was not disputed by the bank itself judge mahoney was murdered with poison less than six months later and the lawyer representing daly was debarred the decision in favor of daly was then nullified on procedural grounds and the entire matter forgotten you are brainwashed you have been raised by a public school system and media that constantly assures you that the reasons for all these wars and assassinations are many and varied the us claims to bring democracy to the conquered lands they havent the usual result of a us overthrow is the imposition of a dictatorship such as the cia overthrow of irans democratically elected government of mohammad mosaddegh and the imposition of the shah or the cia overthrow of chiles democratically elected government of president salvador allende and the imposition of augusto pinochet or to save a people from a cruel oppressor revenge for or that tired wornout catch all excuse for invasion weapons of mass destruction assassinations are always passed off as crazed lone nuts to obscure the real agenda the real agenda is simple it is enslavement of the people by creation of a false sense of obligation that obligation is false because the private central banking system by design always creates more debt than money with which to pay that debt private central banking is not science it is a religion a set of arbitrary rules created to benefit the priesthood meaning the owners of the private central bank the fraud persists with often lethal results because the people are tricked into believing that this is the way life is supposed to be and no alternative exists or should be dreamt of the same was true of two earlier systems of enslavement rule by divine right and slavery both systems built to trick people into obedience and both now recognized by modern civilizatyion as illegitimate now we are entering a time in human history where we will recognize that rule by debt or rule by private central bankers issuing the public currency as a loan at interest is equally illegitimate it only works as long as people allow themselves to believe that this is the way life is supposed to be but understand this above all private central banks do not exist to serve the people the community or the nation private central banks exist to serve their owners to make them rich beyond the dreams of midas and all for the cost of ink paper and the right bribe to the right official behind all these wars all these assassinations the hundred million horrible deaths from all the wars lies a single policy of dictatorship the private central bankers allow rulers to rule only on the condition that the people of a nation be enslaved to the private central banks failing that said ruler will be killed and their nation invaded by those other nations enslaved to private central banks the socalled clash of civilizations we read about on the corporate media is really a war between banking systems with the private central bankers forcing themselves onto the rest of the world no matter how many millions must die for it indeed the constant hatemongering against muslims lies in a simple fact like the ancient christians prior to the knights templars private banking system muslims forbid usury or the lending of money at interest and that is the reason our government and media insist they must be killed or converted they refuse to submit to currencies issued at interest they refuse to be debt slaves so off to war your children must go to spill their blood for the moneyjunkies gold we barely survived the last two world wars in the nuclearbioweapon age are the private central bankers willing to risk incinerating the whole planet just to feed their greed apparently so this brings us to the current situation in the ukraine russia and china the european union had been courting the government of the ukraine to merge with the eu and more to the point entangle their economy with the privateowned european central bank the government of the ukraine was considering the move but had made no commitments part of their concern lay with the conditions in other eu nations enslaved to the ecb notably cyprus greece spain and italy so they were properly cautious then russia stepped in with a better deal and the ukraine exercising the basic choice all consumers have to choose the best product at the best price dropped the eu and announced they were going to go with russias offer it was at that point that agents provocateurs flooded into the ukraine covertly funded by intelligence agency fronts like canvas and usaid stirring up trouble while the western media proclaimed this was a popular revolution snipers shot at people and this violence was blamed on thenpresident yanukovich however a leaked recording of a phone call between the eus catherine ashton and estonias foreign minister urmas paet confirmed the snipers were working for the overthrow plotters not the ukrainian government urmas paet has confirmed the authenticity of that phone call this is a classic pattern of covert overthrow we have seen many times before since the end of ww the us has covertly tried to overthrow the governments of nations succeeding times examples include the overthrow of irans elected government of mohammed mossadegh and the imposition of the shah the overthrow of chiles elected government of salvador allende and the imposition of the pinochet dictatorship and of course the current overthrow of ukraines elected government of yanukovich and the imposition of the current unelected government which is already gutting the ukraines wealth to hand to the western bankers brazil russia india china and south africa have formed a parallel financial system called brics scheduled to officially launch on january as of this writing some nations are ready to trade with brics in transactions that do not involve the us dollar despite us economic warfare against both russia and china the ruble and yuan are seen as more attractive for international trade and banking than the us dollar hence the us attempt to fan the ukraine crisis into war with russia and attempts to provoke north korea as a back door to war with china click for larger image flag waving and propaganda aside all modern wars are wars by and for the private bankers fought and bled for by third parties unaware of the true reason they are expected to gracefully be killed and crippled for the process is quite simple as soon as the private central bank issues its currency as a loan at interest the public is forced deeper and deeper into debt when the people are reluctant to borrow any more that is when the keynesian economists demand the government borrow more to keep the pyramid scheme working when both the people and government refuse to borrow any more that is when wars are started to plunge everyone even deeper into debt to pay for the war then after the war to borrow more to rebuild when the war is over the people have about the same as they did before the war except the graveyards are far larger and everyone is in debt to the private bankers for the next century this is why brown brothers harriman in new york was funding the rise of adolf hitler as long as private central banks are allowed to exist inevitably as the night follows day there will be poverty hopelessness and millions of deaths in endless world wars until the earth itself is sacrificed in flames to mammon the path to true peace on earth lies in the abolishment of all private central banking everywhere and a return to the stateissued valuebased currencies that allow nations and people to become prosperous banks do not have an obligation to promote the public good alexander dielius ceo germany austrian eastern europe goldman sachs i am just a banker doing gods work lloyd blankfein ceo goldman sachs,1

stretch of the election hillary rodham clinton has gone to war with the fbi the word unprecedented has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired but its still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the fbi but thats exactly what hillary and her people have done coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of cnn from their hospital beds would assume that fbi director james comey is hillarys opponent in this election the fbi is under attack by everyone from obama to cnn hillarys people have circulated a letter attacking comey there are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting trump it wouldnt be too surprising if the clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the fbi the fbis leadership is being warned that the entire leftwing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after hillary and the fbis credibility is being attacked by the media and the democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the clinton foundation and hillary clinton the covert struggle between fbi agents and obamas doj people has gone explosively public the new york times has compared comey to j edgar hoover its bizarre headline james comey role recalls hoovers fbi fairly or not practically admits up front that its spouting nonsense the boston globe has published a column calling for comeys resignation not to be outdone time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women james carville appeared on msnbc to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane he accused comey of coordinating with house republicans and the kgb and you thought the vast right wing conspiracy was a stretch countless media stories charge comey with violating procedure do you know whats a procedural violation emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server senator harry reid has sent comey a letter accusing him of violating the hatch act the hatch act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of obama as the tenth amendment but the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the wikipedia article on the hatch act under the table while accusing the fbi director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against hillary ever if james comey is really out to hurt hillary he picked one hell of a strange way to do it not too long ago democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave hillary clinton a pass in a prominent public statement if he really were out to elect trump by keeping the email scandal going why did he trash the investigation was he on the payroll of house republicans and the kgb back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where vladimir putin and paul ryan talked him into taking a look at anthony weiners computer either comey is the most cunning fbi director that ever lived or hes just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a doj leadership whose political futures are tied to hillarys victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs the only truly mysterious thing is why hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected federal agency most americans like the fbi while hillary clinton enjoys a unfavorable rating and its an interesting question hillarys old strategy was to lie and deny that the fbi even had a criminal investigation underway instead her associates insisted that it was a security review the fbi corrected her and she shrugged it off but the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the fbi pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy but it was a better one that picking a fight with the fbi while lunatic clinton associates try to claim that the fbi is really the kgb there are two possible explanations hillary clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the fbi now that she believes that victory is near the same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the fbi for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign but the other explanation is that her people panicked going to war with the fbi is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign its an act of desperation when a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the fbi thats not hubris its fear of what the fbi might be about to reveal about her during the original fbi investigation hillary clinton was confident that she could ride it out and she had good reason for believing that but that hillary clinton is gone in her place is a paranoid wreck within a short space of time the positive clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the fbi theres only one reason for such bizarre behavior the clinton campaign has decided that an fbi investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival and so its gone all in on fighting the fbi its an unprecedented step born of fear its hard to know whether that fear is justified but the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation they knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions now suddenly they are no longer in control and they are afraid you can smell the fear the fbi has wiretaps from the investigation of the clinton foundation its finding new emails all the time and clintonworld panicked the spinmeisters of clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire all thats here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance but this isnt how you react to smoke its how you respond to a fire the misguided assault on the fbi tells us that hillary clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup the email setup was a preemptive cover up the clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief right or wrong that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed the clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption bribery sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years this is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out and they dont want fbi investigators anywhere near it the campaign against comey is pure intimidation its also a warning any senior fbi people who value their careers are being warned to stay away the democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the fbi its an ugly and unprecedented scene it may also be their last stand hillary clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle but shes never shown fear or desperation before now that has changed whatever she is afraid of it lies buried in her emails with huma abedin and it can bring her down like nothing else has,1

more comfortable mattress for relaxing sleep a typical human spends over of hisher entire life sleeping if relaxing sleep is this vital then attention should be given to where the art of sleeping is done the mattress however an uncomfortable mattress could also limit the quality of sleep gotten how do you know when to change mattress do you have to try several sleeping positions before you can sleep are you fond of waking up and shifting positions do you wake up with back and joint pains if you can identify with the above it is time to consider a new mattress a good mattress should provide support for your curves and natural spine limit light exposure hinders relaxing sleep there is a natural occurring hormone in the body called melatonin it is controlled by exposure to light and helps regulate your sleepwake cycle you feel sleepy when the brain secretes more melatonin which occurs majorly during the dark however less melatonin is secreted when there is light making you more alert many aspects of our life can alter the production of melatonin however during the night you could develop some habit that will influence the production of melatonin some of such are within to hours of your bedtime avoid bright light reduce the brightness of your phone or tablet if you must use it avoid latenight tv it suppresses melatonin avoid reading with backlit device sleep in a dark room use heavy curtain to shade light from outside make vigorous exercise a priority one of the many advantages of exercise is that it helps enhance sleep hardly will you see any good exerciser that does not enjoy a sound sleep at night they are hardly a victim of insomnia exercise increases the amount of time you spend in deep and restorative stages of sleep vigorous exercise makes your sleep deep however light exercise as simple as some minutes of the walk could also improve your sleep quality note however that it could take a while before you see the influence of exercise on your sleep but it will come however avoid exercising when its close to your bedtime at least hours to your bedtime is ideal carefully choose your meal the food you eat especially some hours to your bedtime also influences the level and quality of your sleep caffeine and nicotine intake should be reduced they contain a stimulant that can keep you alert for hours also do away with smoking it does not help your sleep avoid background noise you should avoid things that will interfere with your sleep regarding noise white noise is helpful an ideal one can help you block out unnecessary ones a fan is ideal as it not only maintains a consistent flow of air but also provides a continuous background noise you can get a white noise machine or even get the app on your mobile phone some white noise gives the impression of rain wind etc you could also go for a varied sound such as that of a babbling rock waterfall or a croaking frog match your pillow to your sleep position pillows are an essential sleep aid and could make a great deal between having a good night sleep or a bad one your pillow can help lower back pain by using it to support your knees if you sleep on your back while sleeping on your side your pillow could come between your knees this maintains alignment with the hips used to sleeping on your tummy a flat pillow is advised so as not to strain your neck,0

a lifelong dissident and intellectual rebel he despises political correctness which replaces real needy victims with narcissistic leftists out for a free meal though still a young man he has watched society descend into its present morass with great sadness combined with a determination to help make things better he tweets when theres something worth tweeting here october girls forget the movies that set aloof men against loveseeking women it is men who are the hopeless romantics much if not most of the time and they express this extraordinary naivety by engaging in stupid behaviors that their fathers and other male role models should have beaten out of them though feminism demographic trends and socioeconomic realities encourage women to be entitled prima donnas men add to the feedback loop by rewarding modernday princesses of course there are sensible exceptions to avoiding the following behaviors a time and a place for example can be found for defending a woman most notably your mother or wife from someone elses verbal or physical attack likewise sometimes emergencies or certain serious events mean you should put your priorities aside to help a highquality woman who gives longterm value to your life that said in the vast majority of cases acting in this way is unnecessary timeconsuming resourcedraining and plain selfdestructive for a man so here are the five things many men perversely and uselessly keep doing for women fighting for them i lost count long ago of the number of times i have seen a man step in to save a woman from either herself or a slight usually deserved against her a girl will behave like a pork chop at a restaurant club or elsewhere picking a verbal or even physical argument with an employee or fellow patron along comes captainsaveaho who might not even know the girl to protect her honor the expectation of many women that men will do this for them is bad enough let alone when a man does it of his own volition without being requested in return for risking a physical or similar altercation with other people the white knight invariably gets a smile a few words and perhaps a phone number from this point onwards though the interaction between mr white knight and the entitled damsel who causes her own distress invariably fizzles out and it is not just members of your typical white knight crowd who act this way men who are nominally good with women fall into this trap too confusing it with the opportunity to be alpha and dominate over another male the most common outcome sadly is that a womans very poor behavior is condoned by a man falling over himself to be her medieval champion fighting over them not only is this bickering usually illadvised it is often exactly what she wants this stupid behavior is only marginally better than fighting for women and the two activities consistently overlap whilst competition in life including between men over women should be largely encouraged swathes of men are effectively scrapping over last sundays leftovers on a saturday three days after the refrigerator stopped working remember a woman can be attractive but because of her attitude and behavior have very little longterm value for you countless men live with the illusion that if they toil hard enough to get the goodlooking girl it must be worth it thats simply not the case in modern times to boot a lot of sexually thirsty men nowadays are chasing physically lowyield women their fathers and grandfathers would never have noticed at best the majority of men who fight over women are dueling over the prospect of snaring a girl who one of them will probably fuck a few times if at all and if they do manage to secure the girl for a longterm relationship the pairing usually implodes down the track the man either realizes he wasted his time or suffers greatly in material terms such as by being draped divorce raped in the meantime the girls being fought over have their egos stroked time and time again unattractive girls see themselves as attractive and attractive girls with foul entitled princess personalities find themselves validated once more everything in these situations is predicated on the men fighting and proving themselves rather than the women reaching an appropriate standard of physical and emotional femininity paying for them what are you getting from the transaction with her and yes everything is transactional in malefemale relationships unless you are completely sure you have claimed the worlds best girl for yourself and even that belief is probably based on very false or temporary appearances you should ideally be investing less financially in the relationship than she is this may seem counterintuitive especially when a man is sexually valued by women for his status achievements and resources but we are not living in a time when almost every woman is marriageable a man providing for a woman can only justify it if she is of highquality and gives him something back in return on both these counts most men are paying for dud deals in every longterm relationship i have had i have put less into the relationship financially proportionallyspeaking almost always even the girls gross investment has either approximated mine or surpassed it for dates and during casual relationships too i pay for a womans time about as much as she pays for mine if not less when relationships end girls can and do play petty games over money or property you may be owed what matters however is how you conduct yourself overall only when a woman has materially invested in you or invests in you should you invest in her when patriarchy returns the malefemale dynamic will alter before that time be sure she does her fair share financially shifting or sacrificing their priorities for them meanwhile he should be do everything else for himself unlike many other selfdestructive behaviors concerning women this one can be very incremental and hard to spot it is very easy to procrastinate on your work final exams selfdevelopment goals and the rest of your social life when what you feel is a highquality woman comes along in fact nature has basically designed you to do that by throwing your biochemistry into a druglike dependency at the beginning of a courtship in addition to these problems early on men are apt to continue the shelving of their other more personal demands after the relationship is well established on a topic i will explore in more detail in another article there should be certain hours in many days or simply days in general in which women do not even enter your mind contrast this with your average man who will throw away opportunities to further himself to please his girl and often shes not his girl for much longer as his neglect of himself becomes apparent in her less attracted mind by devoting yourself to a ho you become dispensable to a ho not just psychologically but physically financially and socially as well dont let yourself rot your body finances education and other forms of selfimprovement need to be your number one focus after all they are the only things you have or dont have hours a day days a year individual girls may come and go but your obligations to yourself remain paradoxically keeping these obligations to yourself are what attract girls in the first place a man who takes proper care of his money career body and social life gets women moving to them for them sucker this is the one even my leftwing father warned me about but its something a lot of guys are yet to learn like shifting or sacrificing ones priorities moving to a girl for a girl is conducive to throwing your own needs into utter disarray every time i moved to where a girl of mine lived i did so mostly for myself whether to explore a new country for three months or find a new refreshing place to get my work done the relocation benefited me this is qualitatively far different from upending yourself to some new city for the mere chance to thrive and the desire to please a girl perhaps the saddest thing about the man who moves for his girl is that when he wants even a fraction of the favor he gave her hes often left in the lurch dont make this mistake either she must move to you or you move to her for a lot of reasons that dont revolve around her if the relationship fails and most of them do you leave yourself in an equal or better position than the one you would otherwise be in dont follow the crowd of thirsty males too many men slave away in a female desert girls are not nonexistent but theyre too often lowquality relative to what a man is willing to do for them snap yourself out of these behaviors and help your friends shake them off too you may not indulge in them regularly but the temptation to perform them at least sometimes is likely to be there more broadly we need to see a seismic shift in the way many men act become part of the solution so whats just as bad as an entitled woman a man who encourages her entitlement with obsequious validation,0

november bruce thornton is a shillman journalism fellow at the david horowitz freedom center fbi director james comeys reopening of the investigation into clintons emails has roiled once more the presidential election donald trump has called the decision courageous and bigger than watergate clinton the doj democrat senators and their media flying monkeys are all having conniption fits over their quondam champions defection calling the announcement appalling absurd strange deeply troubling an attack and unprecedented the bigger question is whether it will move enough voters over to trumps side and put him in the white house theres no doubt that comeys announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying not because it is unprecedented as the democrats keep squealing they had no such qualms when the weekend before the election special prosecutor lawrence walsh indicted a pollsurging george hw bush for his alleged involvement in the irancontra scandal no the mystery is comeys motives is comey like conrads lord jim now sacrificing his fbi careersure to be over if the notoriously vengeful clinton is elected to atone for having besmirched his office reputation and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist selfinterest or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled fbi investigators to quote one of our candidates at this point what difference does it make the real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters right now we dont know if the content of the emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter anthony weiner estranged husband of clinton vizier huma abedin will reveal something damning like say classified materials but we already know that clinton passed classified information over an unsecured server which didnt bother comey back in july so what could be in these new emails that rises above comeys sophistic extreme carelessness and reaches the statutes gross negligence or has comey found new evidence of hillarys intent his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law there had to be something that made comey subject himself to the scorchedearth wrath of the democrats whatever is found on the abedin laptop one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters they have shrugged off so many scandals lies and failures that should have sunk a candidacy that its hard to calculate what level of incompetence unpleasantness dishonesty sleaze and crime is disqualifying anymore here are the greatest hits from hillarys catalogue whitewater missing billing records from her tenure at the rose law firm renting out the lincoln bedroom to donors travelgate illegal possession of fbi files conducting illegal secret meetings of the task force on national health care reform cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail hounding the victims of her husbands sexual assaults and philandering stealing worth of china furniture and artwork from the white house claiming she landed under sniper fire in bosnia claiming she and bill left the white house dead broke shaking down wall street while assuring the orcs of capitalism that shes got their back charging exorbitant speaking fees for a half hour of banalities and bromides calling missing emails personal communications lying about the benghazi attack to the faces of the four dead americans families supporting the lie that the attacks were caused by an obscure internet video when she knew the same night that they werent perjuring herself before congress and the fbi about the emails and her private server the disastrous overthrow of ghaddafi in libya the disastrous reset with russia the disastrous nuclear deal with iran the disastrous withdrawal from iraq the corrupt clinton foundation and its wholly owned subsidiary the paytoplay state department using feminist rhetoric while taking cash from some of the planets most brutally misogynistic regimes serially flipflopping on issues like samesex marriage the trans pacific trade deal and the keystone pipeline promising to raise taxes on the middle class and put coal miners out of work her campaign staffs dirty tricks against trump and his supporters her campaign staffs incestuous relationship with the media her staffs illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation her strong support of gruesome lateterm abortions and last but not least the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health back in the day just a few of these gaffes deceptions and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for congress let alone the white house and mr trumps offenses hes talks exactly as youd expect a new york real estate developer casino owner reality television star and beauty pageant mogul to talk hes condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what bill clinton and every whitehousevisiting rapper movie star or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity when youre a star they let you do it as trump bragged of his crude sexual advances hes ignorant of policy he doesnt understand the economics of global trade he doesnt know what the nuclear triad is hes addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives he wants to build a wall with mexico he takes legal advantage of tax law hes not suitable for office he does not have the right temperament hes used bankruptcy as a business tool hes accused of groping over a dozen women including a polymorphously perverse porn star hes mean and insulting he has orange hair in short trump lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices just ask hillarys various secret service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be the voters will decide for themselves which candidates catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous but whatever happens its clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates this transformation happened decades before trump and hillary came along after bill clinton was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the white house his approval ratings were he left the white house with a rating higher than any president since harry truman including ronald reagan think about it the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the soviet union into its own dustbin of history that was the inflection point for our political culture no wonder that barack obamas lack of any realworld experience or achievement leftwing views selfconfessed drug use friends like the antiamerican racist jeremiah wright and unrepentant terrorist bill ayers and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to million voters so why now are we shocked shocked that offbrand candidates like hillary clinton and donald trump are vying for the presidency decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue wisdom and decorum have already long gone so absent a smoking howitzer in the next wikileaks dump comeys restart of the investigation which in any case will take months to complete will probably not be the gamechanging october surprise many hope for and others dread especially given a corrupt medias studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate then again the rapid erosion of hillarys support is drawing analogies to reagans late surge against carter either way on november most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria like cares for people like me or they might just finally realize that hillarys accumulated offenses are intolerable but what that standard of selection will deliver is anybodys guess,1

estados unidos y el dólar en el sistema financiero mundial no solamente a través de los intercambios comerciales en monedas locales sino por ejemplo a través de la acumulación de reservas en yuanes entre sus bancos centrales más todavía luego de que la moneda del pueblo renminbi en chino ingresó oficialmente el pasado º de octubre en los derechos especiales de giro special drawing rights la canasta de divisas de élite creada por el fondo monetario internacional fmi a finales de la década de los por añadidura los brics tienen la capacidad de articular una gran alianza financiera con poderosos eslabonamientos geopolíticos entre américa latina asia áfrica y el medio oriente los bancos regionales de desarrollo que están conformados en su mayoría por los países periféricos bien pueden servir a este objetivo el banco asiático de inversiones en infraestructura aiib por sus siglas en inglés el banco del alba alianza bolivariana para los pueblos de nuestra américa e incluso el banco del sur que finalmente arrancará antes de que termine este año asimismo se ha vuelto una imperiosa exigencia para los brics la puesta en marcha de una agencia de calificación propia que rompa con el predominio aplastante que estados unidos mantiene a través de fitch moodys y standard poors estas tres agencias de calificación más que realizar evaluaciones que se guíen por criterios de tipo técnico actúan fundamentalmente bajo impulsos de carácter político esto es como auténticas máquinas de guerra degradan las notas de los bonos de deuda soberana y con ello elevan dramáticamente los costos de financiamiento de países como grecia rusia o venezuela la cohesión económica es otro de los grandes retos si bien es indudable que se ha venido intensificando de forma sustantiva durante los años recientes entre y el comercio entre los brics como proporción de sus intercambios totales se duplicó del al china es por mucho la economía que está más integrada con los demás brics en contraste los vínculos entre países como la india y sudáfrica son marginales lo mismo sucede entre brasil y rusia por eso es muy pertinente la próxima implementación de un área de libre comercio entre los brics sin embargo además de echar abajo las barreras arancelarias entre ellos los brics necesitan promover la construcción de cadenas de valor de forma conjunta esto es integrar sus aparatos productivos para incentivar la industrialización de las economías menos aventajadas en conclusión son muchos los desafíos en el horizonte para estas cinco potencias emergentes estoy convencido de que en lo sucesivo el éxito de los brics dependerá de la capacidad que tengan para reinventarse de su creatividad para articular nuevas dimensiones de cooperación con vistas a cumplir metas de más largo alcance frente a la nueva guerra financiera que prepara estados unidos es momento de que los brics vuelvan a la carga ariel noyola rodríguez fuente russia today rusia,0

about alternative lifestyles about men who have realized what terrible misogynists they are for having sexual desires rather than searching for articles on for pickup artistry sooner rather than later all internet roads will lead to the same new world order socialist philosophy as profiling of internet users becomes more prolific and the algorithms more sophisticated in the coming years the news and information we search for will be tailored to slowly nudge us one way or the other politically one small step at a time the management of the information we get to read is already in its infancy why do you think that free app on your phone that only performs a few functions swells in size with each update that is released do you really think they give a damn about your privacy and are plugging security holes hell no the apps we download are moving from useful lowresource using services to resource hogs necessitating an upgrade in processing power every year or two because they only provide us with a free service in order to hook us so the apps can gather information about everything weve ever written on our devices for social engineers and marketing flacks the apps are becoming more sophisticated in the way they monitor everything we do which is why the apps need all that memory size and soon apps will be gathering information about everything weve ever said aloud by using the built in microphones on each device and speech recognition technology cia agents confirm microphones can easily be activated even when a device is switched completely off this type of information will be collected in giant databases such as the utah data center with the ultimate goal being the corporategovernment complex knowing more about us than we know about ourselves big brother was so yesterday orwells big brother idea never could have imagined the insidious nature of todays information technology todays information technology has put big brother on steroids the waking times details this frightful world that is already emerging as anyone who pays attention knows search engines are already tailoring information to what we search for and even what we text people about mr x weve studied the little virtual bubble you live in and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth most of the time the information one will see in this internet bubble will be customized to suit a persons interests this is why facebook relentlessly pushes the like a page or product portion of its web site this information is used to build a profile of a person that ultimately will be able to accurately predict the color of their next bowel movement if a man is interested in nongmo foods advertising and news stories will be tailored to inform him of grocers who sell organics and about news from approved outlets with stories written on the topic most of the time this will be insidious advertising and ads disguised as information hello audience were going to pitch you on becoming fullfledged obsessed consumers as if there is no other worthy goal in lifeand then were going to profile you from top to bottom to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands the utah data center is designed to store exabytes of information on all forms of communication including emails cell phone calls and internet searches as well as all types of personal data trailsparking receipts travel itineraries and bookstore purchases as another example okay we know you are interested in traditional gender roles we the information managers like facebook and google will now to find news stories and customize the information you get to read online in order to cause you to doubt the validity of your beliefs the ultimate goal is to slowly but steadily move you away from believing in traditional gender roles to believing in militant feminism without you realizing what we have done this type of information management is even more insidious than outright censorship as it will be designed to steer everyone towards what the controllers of society want us to think and buy no matter how far from the ideal consumer and fellow traveler we may be think of it as a game of plinko on the price is right in which all chips ultimately fall into the perfect braindead consumer slot at the bottom of the maze the social engineers dream is a world of nothing but sexless consumers who perform mindless work in meaningless jobs whose only outlets for pleasure are shopping and eating out and other stateapproved activities think thats hyperbole travel around the world for six months to a year then come back to the united states and tell me what you think little information bubbles merge into big information bubbles we become what we are repeatedly exposed to which is why a war is on for your mind once we have you believing a certain way or questioning your established beliefs the key comes when it is time to steer public perception one way or the other this is where the rubber meets the road in the realm of managing the populace like so many sheeple but when a big one comes along like the national election in the us the separate tunes come together and ring as one then the overriding need to extend globalisms goals in the person of hillary clinton blot out every other priority then the major media twist whatever they need to twist then its the same bubble for everyone soon just like the mainstream media on television and in print everything you see online will be directed at making you think behave and vote a certain way the micromanagement and control of information just hasnt become that sophisticated yet obama already hinted that only official information should be linked up by the corporate interests of facebook google etc look for hillary to implement that idea with an iron fist if she is whisked into the oval office an internet security crisis will likely be engineered in the near future in whichyou guessed itbig daddy government needs to step in and take control of the web from there on out we will be back to corporategovernment propaganda instead of the libertarians dream the current iteration of the internet is so the awakening we have seen from the brainwashing of the corporate media will be a temporary one if the elite have anything to do with it the groundwork of this new socialist system of micromanaging information is already being laid you already see it every time you do a search someday soon the only information well be able to find online will be from sources the corporategovernment complex approves of of course there will be renegades and rebels like us who resist but most of the braindead sheeple out there will go along to get along just as has been happening since time immemorial our options will be to get off the grid or to move to a new internet neither move will be peacefully tolerated by the powers that be read more

the use of public lands when it acquitted all seven defendants involved in the armed occupation of a national wildlife refuge in rural southeastern oregon tumult erupted in the courtroom after the verdicts were read when an attorney for group leader ammon bundy demanded his client be immediately released repeatedly yelling at the judge us marshals tackled attorney marcus mumford to the ground used a stun gun on him several times and arrested him us district judge anna brown said she could not release bundy because he still faces charges in nevada stemming from an armed standoff at his father cliven bundys ranch two years ago the portland jury acquitted bundy his brother ryan bundy and five others of conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the malheur national wildlife refuge miles southeast of portland even attorneys for the defendants were surprised by the acquittals its stunning its a stunning victory for the defense said robert salisbury attorney for defendant jeff banta im speechless said defendant neil wampler this is a tremendous victory for rural america and it is a welldeserved overwhelming defeat for a corrupt and predatory federal government the us attorney in oregon billy j williams issued a statement defending the decision to bring charges against the seven defendants we strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a court publicly tried and decided by a jury a bundy daughter bailey logue said family members were savoring the victory and would begin friday to determine their next step first thing were going to get down on our knees and thank our heavenly father and were going to enjoy our families logue said tomorrow were going to figure out what were going to do next messages left for bundy family

bundy are among those who are to go on trial in nevada early next year for that standoff while the charges in oregon accused defendants of preventing federal workers from getting to their workplace the case in nevada revolves around allegations of a more direct threat an armed standoff involving dozens of bundy backers pointing weapons including assaultstyle rifles at federal bureau of land management agents and contract cowboys rounding up cattle near the bundy ranch outside bunkerville daniel hill attorney for ammon bundy in the nevada case said he believed the acquittal in oregon bodes well for his client and the other defendants facing felony weapon conspiracy and other charges when the jury here hears the whole story i expect the same result hill told the associated press in las vegas hill also said hell seek his clients release from federal custody pending trial in nevada ammon bundy and his followers took over the oregon bird sanctuary on jan they objected to prison sentences handed down to dwight and steven hammond two local ranchers convicted of setting fires they demanded the government free the father and son and relinquish control of public lands to local officials the bundys and other key figures were arrested in a jan traffic stop outside the refuge that ended with police fatally shooting robert lavoy finicum an occupation spokesman most occupiers left after his death but four holdouts remained until feb when they surrendered following a lengthy negotiation federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case finishing with a display of more than guns seized after the standoff an fbi agent testified that live rounds and nearly spent casings were found during trial bundy testified that the plan was to take ownership of the refuge by occupying it for a period of time and then turn it over to local officials to use as they saw fit bundy also testified that the occupiers carried guns because they would have been arrested immediately otherwise and to protect themselves against possible government attack the bird sanctuary takeover drew sympathizers from around the west it also drew a few protesters who were upset that the armed occupation was preventing others from using the land they included kieran suckling executive director of the center for biological diversity suckling on thursday called the acquittals extremely disturbing for anyone who cares about americas public lands the rights of native people and their heritage and a political system that refuses to be bullied by violence and racism the bundy clan and their followers peddle a dangerous brand of radicalism aimed at taking over lands owned by all of us i worry this verdict only emboldens the kind of intimidation and rightwing violence that underpins their movement suckling said one of ammon bundys attorneys morgan philpot had a different perspective after watching mumford get tackled by marshals his liberty was just assaulted by the very government that was supposed to protect it by the very government that just prosecuted his client unjustly as the jury found theres another oregon trial coming up over the wildlife refuge authorities had charged occupiers with conspiracy eleven pleaded guilty and another had the charge dropped seven defendants chose not to be tried at this time their trial is scheduled to begin feb,0

trumpers sincerity i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong and then there are the selfrighteous plankintheeye never trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltinesssinned against god and compromised their principles brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary clintons tyranny in perpetuity the media research center has done america a tremendous service in the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion something hillary clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate stared into the camera with cold callous eyes and then both lied about and defended unequivocally i plead with never trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov mrs clintons beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother during a partialbirth abortion the abortionist pulls a fully viable child often kicking and thrashing feet first from her mothers womb leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion rather than committing murder he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt next he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains thereby collapsing her skull her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage this is homicide plain and simple hillary clinton supports it donald trump opposes it we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch in my estimation mrs clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs clinton and ensure that she is stopped she must not be elected president to not vote or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate which is effectively the same thing while not an actual vote for mrs clinton still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court its simple math and its undeniable the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs clinton by voting for mr trump this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations with its roe v wade decision the us supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder since then the battle lines have been drawn this is war prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers the good guys it really is that simple that black and white its good versus evil history will reflect as much under a president hillary clinton millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive under a president donald trump these millions might live and yet even as hillary sharpens her knives we quibble like fools over donalds potty mouth the devil and democrats oh how they love derision and division within the body of christ,0

retained by the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee shares an elite stratum of wealthy and politically dominant people intends to make hillary clinton our next president these are the oligarchs the whose wealth and incomes continue growing while most american struggle in her private life hillary clinton is wellpositioned among this cohort and they expect her as president to protect their wealth and maintain their dominance she will to assure the oligarchs success the democratic national committee is brutalizing the presidential electoral process willfully violating rules laws and precedent the strategy succeeded in the primary elections and it will win the general who are these people the top of wealthholders numbers about million predominantly they are citizens whose wealth depends on the huge american domestic and transnational corporations either directlyexecutives directors investors contractors suppliersor indirectly in other ways eg investment bankers hedge fund managers consultants top law firms two preeminent names in this grouping are hillary and bill clinton whose net worth about million qualifies the couple for the stratum by a factor of others are wall street bankersthe clintons primal financial benefactors and firstname friends lloyd blankfein jamie dimon robert rubin brian moynihan michael corbat james gorman timothy geithner john stumpf etc a more accurate description of the would be the corporate elite candidate clintons relationship to her elite compatriots is one of rigid interdependence she needs their financial and political resources to win the election and they need her in the white house to sustain their privileged status this privileged status did not result from accident random chance or neglect it is a consequence of public policies consciously adopted over the past three or four decades which shift wealth and incomes systematically upward cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy for example while exporting of the nations manufacturing jobs in the process our democracy was transformed public policy is crafted today not primarily to advance the welfare of the nations people but to create protect or enhance the financial interests of american corporate enterprise this is acknowledged in the statements of public figures and supported in rigorous scholarly research more a new email investigation on clinton could hasten the democratic partys demise the banana republic of america democracy be damned to the superdelegates stand tall in statesmanship anointment of hillary clinton exposes a democracy that never was though easily identifiable the corporate elite has not constructed a conscious conspiracy against the american people at large with a preplanned agenda strategy and tactics but they share a common mindset they are networked by personal acquaintance and they are driven by a common imperative their wealth and political dominance depend on the existing configurations of american domestic and foreign policy both of which must be maintained essentially intact to sustain the groups position of privilege alterations in the status quo can be tolerated only if they are cosmetic slight and at the margin instead of conspiracy the preeminence of the oligarchs is better seen as a malignant condition of contemporary american government resulting from years of institutional decay and corruption the story of moribund democracy is detailed here the economic and political power of megacorporationsincreasingly fewer but ever largerhas displaced functional democracy yes we vote as we always have but voting and democracy are not interchangeable terms the russian people voted for vladimir putin the iraqis voted for saddam hussein and voting isnt a prerequisite for democracy to function the ancient greeks chose their representatives by lottery the priority of corporate interests has been achieved by three powerful mechanisms perhaps the least recognized is the degree to which corporate personnel enter government to staff the highest levels of the executive branch a new book by political scientists bastiaan van apeldoorn and nana de graaff carries a sobering title american grand strategies and corporate elite networks they looked into the grand strategy makers the most influential people in cabinetlevel and senior advisory positions in the last three administrationsbill clintons bushs and obamas in the clinton administration of the grand strategy makers were linked to different transnational or financial corporations as executives directors senior associates or partners in law firms either prior to their public service or after it in the bush administration of the had connections to corporations in the obama administration of the over had such toplevel corporate affiliations with companies smoking guns examples of wealthshifting upward to the already rich certainly the repeal of the glasssteagall act rammed through in the bill clinton administration by treasury secretary robert rubin from citigroup this enabled the subprime loan frenzy enriching the new york banks but destroying trillion in americans household wealth halliburtons nobid obscenely profitable contracts in iraq served up by vice president richard cheney during the bush administration billions of taxpayers dollars to the corporation mr cheney once chaired in the obama administration treasury secretary timothy geithner from wall street administered the troubled asset relief program bailing out his colleagues banks again with billions of taxpayers money for the last years the executive branch has been dominated by the corporate elite two other mechanisms of corporate influence are far more familiar the corporate financing of political campaigns and the ubiquitous enterprise of lobbying the two practices are related in direct proportion the more you accept in contributions from boeing say the more you feel obligated to yield to their lobbyists wishes your policymaking independence will decrease then as the costs of campaigning rise and contemporary costs are staggering a representative today must raise on average million in campaign funding a senator million a presidential race runs in the hundreds of millions hillary clinton has taken in million since citizens united corporate campaign funding has no limits and with candidates in need of so many millions the corporate capture of federal governance is undeniable and scarcely surprising undeniable but easily surmounted we once had a law on the books the uk still does limiting not campaign contributions but campaign expenditures the limits were for a senate race for a representative sums easily provided from personal assets and those of family and friends reenacting such a law would break the corporate stranglehold intense lobbying might continue but no senator no representative would feel the courteous urge to accommodate the welfare of the american people could regain priority the impact on the oligarchs however would be apocalyptic the commitment of the corporate elite to sustain the status quo is apparently absolute by april of the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign were one indistinguishable juggernaut intent on blitzing the presidential campaign like hitlers wehrmacht stormed through europe the watch words seemed to be first and most they amassed an early warchest of a hundred million dollars or so and lined up superdelegate endorsementsall before there was a single announced opponent they invited print and television journalists to meetings in early april to help in framing the hrc message and framing the race among them were george stephanoplous and others from abc rachel maddow and more from msnbc gloria borger and of her colleagues from cnn and from the new york times bloomberg politico and cbs each sent along two the firstandmost strategy worked secretary clinton preempted the candidate space the only others attracted to the race were lackluster lightweights especially the wooly socialist from vermont but senator sanders electrifying rallies made tangible the disgust of the american people with the status quo sanders proposals were anything but cosmetic slight and at the margin they posed a mortal threat to the corporate elite and its guardian the clinton campaign to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games sanders had to sue to gain access to the dncs voter database the deliberate tilting of the democratic primaries gained momentum to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games this may not be the first election in which ethics and law were abandoned but never before has it been so reliably exposed not by the mainstream media though they either ignored the increasingly evident fraud or were complicit in it from the iowa caucuses onward the press treated clintons superdelegate endorsements as tallied votes this continued even after the distortion and dishonesty of doing so were pointed out based on precisely that deception however the associated press announced clintons presumptive nomination on monday june one day before primaries were held in california montana new jersey north and south dakota and the district of columbia from iowa forward also the washington post and the new york times hammered the sanders campaign without mercy or interruption the story was detailed later by thomas frank in harpers magazine frank concludes i have never before seen the press take sides like they did this year openly and even gleefully badmouthing candidates who did not meet with their approval no the major media failed to expose the fraud but the social media and the internet abounded with skepticism sanders fans questioned the uncounted caucuses in iowa the reduction of polling places in maricopa county arizona the disqualified sanders delegates at the nevada convention the cheapshot call by the associated press many were certain the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee were joined at the hip but there was scant factual evidence enter julian assange and the leaked dnc emails now the illegal collusion was documented the sabotaging of the sanders campaign exposed wassermanschultz resigns as dnc chair then the podesta emails and hillarys paid speeches you need both a public position and a private position my dream is a hemispheric open market with open trade and open borders dnc vicechair donna brazile a cnn pundit emails the clinton campaign prior to the debate from time to time i get the questions in advance the attempt to reschedule the illinois primary another tranche of emails arrives braziles complicity with the clinton campaign is broadened she is firedresigns from her cnn post the clinton foundation hosts pay to play the clintons personal enrichment the million deal with king mohammed vi of morocco finally the compliant mass media did take note this is after all fine spectacle noted but not pursued no determined effort was undertaken to investigate to document further the deceit and dishonesty and to assess its magnitude once again that was left to the citizenry the first careful detailed study was published june by two scholars axel geijel of tilburg university and rodolfo cortes barragan at stanford it is entitled are we witnessing a dishonest election they compared states whos voting systems produced verifying paper trails against states which did not sanders won the papertrail states where tampering with machine tallies could be quickly discovered clinton overpowered in states without paper trails where tampering could never be detected the authors also compared voting machine tallies with exit poll figures and found disturbing discrepancies they concluded these data suggest that election fraud is occurring in the democratic party presidential primary election this fraud has overwhelmingly benefited secretary clinton at the expense of senator sanders the paper can be found here then with the primaries concluded a group of outraged patriots with day jobs organized as election justice usa published an exhaustive report the study is entitled democracy lost a report on the fatally flawed democratic primaries and it is available here it details in pages of carefully assembled and compelling evidence examples of election fraud uncovered in four categories voter suppression registration tampering illegal voter purging and fraudulent voting machine tallies in eleven states the group found discrepancies between exit polls and voting machine counts exceeding the statistical margins of error every single discrepancy favored secretary clintonand no such discrepancies occurred in the republican counts the groups conclusion was troubling elected delegates their report argues persuasively were awarded fraudulently to clinton and denied sanders accordingly that gave her the edge in delegate count going into the convention in the end however she needed the additional votes of unelected superdelegates those empowered by the democratic national committee even after a primary season documented as fraudulent then hillary clintons nomination was achieved by fiat not democracy but the corporate elite will not be denied given the clintondnc expertise and success in tipping the primary elections she will be elected president in the general election guaranteed the manipulation of the primaries was obscure but not invisible a backlash of outrage might have been anticipated the clintondnc people however are unmatched in hubris and geniuses in the practice of deceit scandals were not even acknowledged defiantly ignored and the language of progressive democracy is omnipresent in the campaigning brilliant deception hillary clinton promises to work for main street not wall street she promises to bring back jobs improve education seek equal pay for women boost the minimum wage expand civil rights provide free college education move toward medicare for all oppose tpp break up the toobigtofail wall street banks fine appealing proposals all but this is the language of sanders revolution and the corporate elite will stand for none of it but folk wisdom tells us to take campaign promises lightly and the american people are forgiving and trusting hillary clinton is a woman of long experience and we want to believe our democracy is robust here now we need to be vigilant endnotes see testing theories of american politics elites interest groups and average citizens by martin gillens and benjamin page they conclude economic elites

try it is a method of relieving pain or curing an illness by placing needles in the patients body at precise points along the meridians in the body meridians are energy pathways that are associated with different organs within the body the world health organization lists ailments that are treatable by chinese medicine acupuncture reason acupuncture has helped children with eczema in a study of children who were treated with chinese medicinal herbs the treatment reduced eczema symptoms by in of the children see sources although it was a small study size the benefits seem to far outweigh the risks when my son was a baby even a improvement in his symptoms would have been amazing for us reason acupuncture does not hurt babies many people worry about the needles hurting but the needles that acupuncturists use are about th of a syringe needle my son was a baby when we started the treatments and he never cried out when getting the needles in him reason acupuncture relieved my babys eczema by acupuncture healed the eczema to the point where we could figure out his triggers our doctor stabilized the eczema best of all flareups only occurred when my baby was teething his skin was softer than it had been in months acupuncture needs to be done on babies for a minimum of months in order to see an improvement this is because the treatment is trying to alter the immune response which is a long process but sometimes babies will respond quicker than that we used a topical herb powder given to us by the doctor and applied it to his skin this topical mix had a similar effect as hydrocortisone cream if i applied it times per day with a cotton ball reason acupuncture is affordable this is true especially if you go to a student clinic you can pay the affordable price and yet the students are supervised by very experienced doctors for child and baby treatments it is even more affordable it cost us about per visit on average we tried a few different clinics some health

practitioner who does many different types of treatments tips for helping your child while getting acupuncture bring a favorite stuffed animal a book or some toys try nursing your baby while they are

do not respond as quickly as babies bodies do check out my youtube video for more tips find an experienced accredited acupuncturist make sure to look for an accredited acupuncturist or tcm traditional chinese medicine doctor be sure the acupuncturist has some experience in your condition chat with the people in the waiting room and see if theyve had success with your doctor i met a few moms in the waiting room that swore by the chinese doctor we were going to see that made me feel more comfortable find a tcm traditional chinese medicine doctor who offers certified organic chinese herbs certified organic means the herbs were never sprayed with toxic pesticides and herbicides as well there have been some reports of heavy metals residue in chinese herbs herbs are just as powerful as

bob unruh joined wnd in after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law alabamas judges are elected and accountable wrote justice tom parker this week federal judges as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v hodges a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to samesex marriage are unaccountable and unelected he pointed out that three of the four dissenting us supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were consequently unaccountable parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning history tradition the courts own rules or the rule of law but upon their empathetic feelings obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges he said he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriagebased case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case which created samesex marriage nationwide was announced moore who is challenging the punishment insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves they did with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments parker said active judges should have been included in the panel because retired judges too are unelected and unaccountable unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda instead of faithfully applying the rule of law parker warned obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided obergefell the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states dont miss phyllis schlaflys book now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family before obergefell states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in of those states the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account citing the situation that developed in iowa the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa however although the judges are initially appointed they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law in april in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional the very next year three of the judges who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa this was the first time since iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law mathew staver chairman of of liberty counsel which is representing moore said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law he said the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every turn this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the vote never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart who has been acting as alabamas chief justice she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary they will no doubt take our complaint seriously as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore said tom ford a spokesman for the group the complaints the group said outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety failed to perform the duties of her office impartially failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary daniel horowitz senior editor at conservative review told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues whether its the bureaucrats whether its the courts and as it relates to even religious liberty even property rights immigration our voting rights who gets to vote he said horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america how did we get here horowitz asked rhetorically and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges the legal profession and unelected bureaucrats that is social transformation without representation which as scalia warned is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in by the bare majority made up of anthony kennedy ruth ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan john roberts clarence thomas samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it the majority found in the constitution a right to samesex marriage overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the us supreme court majority for one two of the justices in the majority kagan and ginsburg were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality without their votes the case would have gone the other way they refused then there was the us supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier in the defense of marriage act case in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people as wnd reported ginsburg who voted in favor of samesex marriage has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements justice elena kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case but they refused to acknowledge the request the foundation explained that canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court usc sec a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned rabbi jonathan cahn author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah judgment movie has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning a nation at war against its own foundation washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained justices can you judge the ways of god there is another court and there is another judge where all men and all judges will give account he warned if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal he said see jonathans cahns message at washington man of prayer event at the capitol the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling samesex marriage an intrinsic evil and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court wnd also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of washington lee boston college kansas state notre dame university of texas villanova vanderbilt hillsdale university of nebraska catholic university and regent university issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the supreme courts recent creation of samesex marriage as anticonstitutional and illegitimate it cannot be taken to have settled the law of the united states said the statement from the american principles project we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case to recognize the authority of states to define marriage and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell,1

be bills huma the guy that the big guy couldnt go to the bathroom without let alone perform the simplest tasks the clinton foundation was a band project the waters grew murkier but the recent email leaks revealed a rather devastating doug band memo on how he was making money for the whole infrastructure of what he called running bill clinton inc and band was also organizing personal income directly for clinton under the heading forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc band wrote we have dedicated our selves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activitiesincluding speeches books and advisory service engagements in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his familyfor personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president clinton to date or the million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements band mentions four such arrangements without naming them bill clinton was paid nearly million to be honorary chancellor of a forprofit college laureate international universities according to reports and the familys tax returns a dubaibased firm gems education paid bill clinton more than in according to the tax returns band also lists a variety of speaking fees previously disclosed by the clintons including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from ubs ericsson bhp and barclays in alone according to the clintons tax returns bill clinton earned in speaking fees of course there was lots of synergy between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff between dougs teneo interests and the entire clintonworld octopus we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities band wrote he also said he had sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation bands memo provided data showing how much money each of teneos clients at the time had given to the clinton foundation how much they had paid bill clinton and in some cases how he or kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments band wrote that teneo partners had raised in excess of million for the foundation and million in paid speaking fees for bill clinton he said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place band also described how kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with ubs global wealth management introducing bill clinton to a top executive at a charity dinner in the ensuing years ubs upped its giving to the foundation signed on as a teneo client and agreed to pay bill clinton for speeches band wrote band was actually making the case that the entire network of the clinton foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the clintons not to mention the interests of people around them banks and major corporations were doing business with bills toady paying bill money and donating to the clinton foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part band described in the memo how he combined his work for cgi and teneo he wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the cgi gathering to meet with teneo clients he also acknowledged giving free cgi memberships to target teneo clients being cultivated as potential foundation donors memberships generally cost a year teneo meanwhile named bill clinton its honorary chairman clinton had been initially tapped for a threeyear arrangement in which he would provide advice to teneo regarding geopolitical economic and social trends according to a separate june memo that band wrote to the state department seeking ethics approval for the former presidents employment bill clinton was initially paid million by teneo according to man of the world a book written with the former presidents participation by author joe conason and heres where it gets appropriately entertaining but band outlined that kelly his teneo cofounder had served simultaneously between and as an unpaid economic envoy to northern ireland appointed by thensecretary of state hillary clinton and as head of a separate consulting company whose clients included coke ubs and dow band wrote that the arrangement was consistent with kellys state department ethics agreement kellys multiple roles came together during one state department event in when thensecretary clinton recognized dow among other companies for creating jobs in northern ireland and thanked kelly for his work on the issue dow became one of teneos first major clients according to bands memo dow chief executive andrew

evolve into their best selves on his blog masculine development and recently launched his ebook on strategies to develop your masculinity november game after my previous article which advocated that men learn game as a form of selfdevelopment i got a good amount of disagreementmost of it was not inaccurate the majority of rok readers are becoming less and less interested in learning game simply because western women are not as attractive as they once were this isnt to say that weve abandoned learning game as a whole certainly we still want to get laid and eventually find a girl for a relationship but nonetheless there seems to be a large portion of the manosphere which simply doesnt believe that game is worth it anymore in this article i would like to present a very realistic and objective perspective in regards to learning game in retrospect my last article may have been too focused on the positive aspects i do not wear the rose colored glasses in regards to the game in fact its quite the opposite as a veteran myself im quite aware of the troubles that men can encounter when learning game ive been slapped for making mildly offensive jokes ive had drinks thrown on me ive had guys threaten to slit my throat and more despite this however i still believe that it is worth it to learn game beginners hell how dare you try to ask me my name you fucking rapist i believe that the reason why most men dont feel that game is worth it is because they experience difficulty getting over a period known as beginners hell this is when youre just starting to shrug off your feminist conditioning and you havent developed the confidence or game that you need to succeed most beginners walk around not really knowing how to talk to women how to carry themselves or how to flirt in general because of this women will typically have one of two responses they pity you and ignore you they lash out and berate you for being a creep or weird of course you may get the occasional girl whos drunk enough to be into you but these are few and far between for the most part the beginners hell phase of learning game is absolutely horrendous you will be sometimes be targeted by club douchebags who will either confront you or use their superior social intelligence to embarrass you and on the rare occasion that you do manage to get a girl talking to you hell come over and steal her you will have women smack you ignore you and tell you offagain its called beginners hell for a reason s who think theyre s this initial difficulty in learning game is only compounded by our cultures general lack of femininity it is extremely obvious to anyone with eyes to see that women in our culture are encouraged to be less and less feminine as time goes on the once praised virtues of nurturing empathy and kindness have now been replaced by resting bitch face sociopathy and social climbing this coupled with the fact that women experience an endless supply of beta orbiters means that theyve been conditioned to believe theyre highly sought after goddesses who can use men like tissues without any sort of social repercussions and in fact theyre sometimes praised for doing so this is perhaps one of the biggest obstacles to newbies struggling to learn game couple this with severe approach anxiety a complete lack of masculinity and a weak body that hasnt been trained and its very easy to see why most men dont see that game is worth it the turning point once one gets beyond this initial bump however most of game is smooth sailing once the newbie has learned how to fix his lack of masculinity how to balance assertiveness with consent and has improved his game in general he enters what i call the turning point the turning point is essentially that point at which learning game is no longer a struggle but its actually enjoyable this is due to several key lifestyle and mindset shifts which take place as the newbie gets more and more success such as drawing state from within rather than from without being in a state of abundance rather than scarcity improving other areas of your life which creates an upwards spiral if youre a newbie struggling to learn game and you dont feel like its worth it i fully empathize with your painthe problem is that when you dont have much game of course learning game will be hard because you get stuck with the bitchy fat girls when you start to develop the three characteristics that i mentioned however a cascade of effects starts to take place that catapults your game to the next level this allows you to pick and choose which hot girls you want rather than being at the mercy of the ugly who might want to come over and hang out internal vs external drawing of state by my age you realize that bitches aint shit but hoes and tricks the transition from drawing state from outside of you to drawing state from within you is literally the difference between a guy that doesnt pull at all and a guy that can pull victorias secret models let me explain women typically draw state from without this means that their emotions are governed by their environment this is why they respond so much more to social pressure than men why they just want to dance when a song they like comes on and its why theyre generally so emotionally volatile due to their changing environments their emotions change rapidly as well this is why they want men to draw state from within or in other words not be affected by their outside environments this is why women are repulsed by men who care too much about their opinions its indicative of a man who draws state from without as a man drawing state from within has numerous benefits the most obvious of which being that youre perpetually in a good mood once you learn to make this shift and learn to be happy regardless of your external circumstances women will pick up on it like a hawktheyre very attuned to this type of thing and youll definitely notice a difference in their behavior this will get them vying for your attention which will start to give you tremendous power this will make game fun which will lead to even more women in your life which will begin the start of your upward spiral the beginning of the upward spiral once you begin to make this simple mindset shift game will no longer feel like its not worth it you see game feels like its not worth it when you have to put in a huge amount of effort for a below average looking girl with a horrible personality but when you start to get to the point where you can put in a medium amount of effort for a very gorgeous woman thats when game starts to be fun this basic mindset shift of learning to not care what your environment is like and to simply be happy by yourself will create a chain reaction within your life first youll start to get much more women much more easily this will allow you to start a harem which will keep you in a perpetual state of abundance until you find a girl you want for a relationship this state of abundance will amplify your game by about five fold women will sense that youve got a ton of other women vying for your attention and they will do the sameits like a magnet that just draws them in plus if a girl does or says something that you dislike you can simply kick her out of your life since you have so many other women then when you start to have so many women in your life youll start to friend zone hot girls for the social benefits because you simply cant handle sleeping with all of them theyll invite you to parties and try to hook you up with their friends and youll receive many of

learning game at first is a huge struggleyou will encounter massive cock blocks a lot of negativity from women and not to mention youll have to deal with all of the white knights too but if you can learn to get over this initial beginners hell as ive coined it you will see the other side of reality that most men are shielded from i realize that it can be very difficult to learn game at first and

revolution in the concept of human rights a recognition of the absolute right of every people to preserve its human diversity independence and freedom the right of every people to preserve its culture traditions art forms and characteristics of society a path to peace and harmonious nations and societies why we must resist globalist destruction of freedom globalist forms of economic and financial slavery and globalist zionist wars in the power of its reason love and understanding this declaration of human diversity and freedom can be the moral engine to saving our european heritage and truly the rights of every people on earth the foundation of human freedom i believe that each of us must be committed to the preservation of human diversity i cherish not only the value of every form of life on earth in what we call biodiversity but also respect and honor the diversity of mankind i believe that every people has the right to preserve their expression of humanity its own heritage and culture that every people on earth has the right rule themselves and the right to be free and independent human freedom is the principle that all peoples must be free to be different humanity is not one it is many destroying the variety diversity and freedom of a diverse humanity is a destruction of humanity itself not recognizing the inborn urge of every people to express their essence in their own forms of art music culture religion societal structure and government leads to human conflict and often to violence and human suffering on a horrific scale much of the worlds conflicts are not because peoples and cultures are different but because they are not allowed to be different because globalists and imperialists seek to expand their empires they want to control the resources and economy of all nations and destroy real human diversity human differences in values cultures economies religions and their freedom and independence to preserve and celebrated those differences stand in the way of the globalists who want to regiment mankind and make them soulless consumers human diversity is natural human life is expressed in a multitude of diverse peoples created by geographic and social adaption over the course of thousands of years whether we celebrate human diversity as the handiwork of nature or in a religious sense as the creation of god we celebrate the rich tapestry of different peoples and cultures across the earth we believe that every people and culture has the right to preserve its unique expression of humanity that every people has the right to maintain and enrich its unique culture to nurture its particular expressions of art music literature philosophies architecture religion diet traditions and values that make every people unique and add beauty and possibility for mankind we believe that every people has the right to be politically free and independent and not be ruled over or exploited by any other people or nation and we reject the globalist power that seeks to destroy the independence and freedom of every people and destroy human diversity every people must have the right to self preservation and freedom we believe that every free people has the right to live in a harmonious society created in its own image its own nature and spirit for example the people of tibet have the human right to live in a society oriented to the heritage culture and tradition of that nation as should all peoples today the tibetan people are threatened by massive nontibetan immigration forced by an imperial power meant to marginalize the heritage and culture of tibetan people in their own homeland the loss of the unique people and culture of tibet is a horrific loss for them and truly a loss for all of humanity what is true for tibet and the tibetan people is true for every people on earth we believe that the people of tibet and every nation have the right to defend their borders and an inherent human right to preserve its unique ethnic and cultural character and its freedom and independence nations more similar in their cultural ethnic religious and social traditions are tend to be far more harmonious that those wracked with internal cultural ethnic or religious divisions we also affirm that states with significant ethnic and cultural minorities tend to be more happy peaceful and cooperative when each group has the freedom to an autonomy that makes each group feel more at home in society if one looks honestly at the world he quickly recognizes that the greatest source of civil conflict hatreds wars genocide and other horrific human rights violations comes from ethnic conflict often accompanied by religious conflict and when that happens it is like putting a fuse into dynamite it is a truism that if you want to reduce ethnic conflict you must endeavor to give every people the human right to live and to create society and community in its own values and that every group respect the right of every other group to do this we believe that these endemic conflicts are rooted in supranational states and globalist denial of the reality of human diversity and denial of the natural human desire of people to live in a society reflecting their own heritage traditions culture and values one size does not fit all instead of recognizing this reality the globalists and empire builders seek to destroy the distinctions of humanity so they will become more compliant to their control and exploitation instead of accepting the reality of human nature and truly the diversity of all life including human life the globalists continue to promote destructive policies that destroy the harmony of traditional societies and historical character of nations massive immigration of diverse peoples into another peoples living space produces conflict not harmony we believe that massive forced immigration of nonindigenous people into other peoples lands is almost always against the will of the indigenous people and this leads to civil repression conflict hatreds violence one does not have to look much further than the palestinian nakba or the massive immigration into tibet as examples of this universal truth but this reality is just as true in europe and other areas of the world that have undergone massive immigration into it regions and nation states look at the riots and deep social unrest and conflict that have befallen traditional harmonious societies that have experienced massive unwanted immigration a world of independent cultures is true diversity and freedom a multicultural state does not contribute to human diversity it does not contribute to human happiness peace and harmony it more often than not lessens human love and human rights no matter what the high motive it produces more disharmony than harmony more discord than accord just as in the natural world every life form needs its own living space and needs the preservation of its own ecosystem to survive and flourish so it is true for every people of humanity every people needs a living space and ecocultural system in which it can thrive ignoring this reality leads to conflict diverse human peoples and cultures and religions competing in a limited living space is the greatest single cause of civil war and crimes against humanity united nations studies show ethnic cultural and religious conflicts within nations are the primary engines of civil conflict and war which takes an enormous toll in human suffering numbering hundreds of millions of dead injured and dispossessed human beings this urge to diversity has always been in mankind and always will be not to recognize this elemental part of mankinds nature is the progenitor of conflict in fact with the rise of the idea that people have the right to be free ethnic conflict is increasing as the imperial states created by conquest can no longer repress the desire of diverse people for their freedom and ethnic expression nations whose rulers have established immigration policies ignoring human differences are increasingly divided and conflicted trying to change the natural urge toward freedom is like screaming against the tide the global elite in government and media which has a huge stake in trying to regiment the worlds populations tell us we are all the same and they endeavor to destroy every unique culture and human expression they attempt to change human nature but history and an increasingly conflicted world show that this is like screaming against the tide better to recognize human nature and within that context support national and regional freedom that lessons conflict and supports mutual respect it is time to teach the new ethic that recognizes the human right of every people to exist and thrive however those who seek their own peoples freedom must understand that these rights must be afforded to every people and any effort toward this worthy goal must be in the spirit of not destroying the rights of others and to peaceful resolution of the conflicts it is far better to recognize these realities and inherent desires of humanity and avoid as much human conflict as possible than to try to destroy human distinctions in pursuit of imperialist empire or globalist regimentation and conformity even if the destruction of peoples is based on a utopian vision because it goes against basic human nature it ultimately leads not to a dreamed of peace and love between people but to conflict and hate attempts to control exploit or harm any people is a crime against humanity we must condemn violence and the harming or destruction of any people we must adopt a clear human ethic that attempts to control or exploit any other nation or people is a crime against humanity we support human freedom and we support human diversity and we support the right of every people to have their own nation or society but we do not support supremacism control or repression of any other people efforts to control or exploit is a crime against humanity as a person of european descent i see that much of the repressive globalism damaging the world originates in mostly european peopled nations that are today called the west i see that this globalism not only damages and harms the worlds diversity of peoples but that it harms my own people and i have learned that we must not allow this exploitation of our own heritage and be just as committed to the well being of all of humanity this is a lifechanging lesson that i have learned in my own life as a very young man i joined a nonviolent klan organization in my community like so many young people across the world i longed to identify with my own people to defend the heritage that i love and that i believed was threatened but still as a young man i left the organization because i came to realize i have no moral right to speak about human rights for my own people unless i embrace the idea of the same human rights for every people and further that we must be committed to securing human rights not with war not with violence not with human suppression but the power of human ideas and ideals i believe that the vast majority of the earths people believe in the principles i set forth here in my own life i further realized that other peoples have the same the desires for their own peoples heritage and rights that i have for mine i realize fully that only in a context of genuine commitment to respect the rights and freedoms of all humanity can one morally campaign for your own peoples fundamental rights defending the diversity of humanity is a defense of humanity itself there is nothing wrong with a people defending their own rights and heritage in fact defending and preserving the diversity of humanity is defense of humanity itself but it must come with a genuine concern for the rights and heritage of all in that context and only with that understanding can we move toward peaceful resolutions of social religious and ethnic conflicts and at the same time preserve our own heritage and the diversity and freedom of humanity nations that have an overwhelmingly unifying heritage culture religious and social tradition have the right to preserve their expression of humanity and their societal harmony it is a crime to destroy those values in pursuit of socalled multiculturalism and if one wants to see where massive immigration of alien peoples cultures and religions lead just look to what happened in the warravaged now dismembered nation once called yugoslavia look to the cultural and ethnic genocide in tibet look to the tribal and religious conflicts in many nations of the mideast group differences run deep even though the muslim quran repeatedly teaches muslim unity still some extremist elements of shiites and sunnis blow up the children of each other in the others holy places of worship nor did the admonitions of jesus christ against violence and for love and reconciliation stop irish catholics and scottishderived protestants from a cascade of violence that has lead to the death of countless innocents although we understand the historical motives of mass immigration of one people into another peoples lands we must not continue to repeat those mistakes in the modern world and create more divided and strifetorn communities regions and nations models of self rule and societal harmony and just as a majority has the human right to live in a social fabric in harmony with its history and values so minorities must be accorded their human right to have their own communities or regions that reflect their own essence or helped to migrate to a sovereign region of compatriots this is human freedom and this is human rights on the most fundamental level those nations with significant minorities of diverse people should strive toward recognizing their desire for freedom and self expression autonomy within nations such as the german language speaking south tyrol region of north italy and the italian french and germanspeaking cantons of switzerland offer models of how recognition of differences in language heritage ethnicity and a liberal degree of autonomy can lead to a more peaceful national fabric nation states that seek imperial power through the conquering and subjection of other peoples are now coming apart at the seams because of the inherent will to freedom and identity that grow in suppressed people even european nations divided by slight differences in history identity genetics and culture seek this freedom the artificially created nation of czechoslovakia was composed of czechs and slovaks held together by years of intense totalitarian physical suppression propaganda and conditioning when the communist tyranny collapsed they used their new freedom to create the independent states of the czech republic and the slovak republic they did this with mutual respect and not war and without horrific crimes against humanity contrast that to the artificially created state of yugoslavia created in name of empire and then held together under a ruthless authoritarian regime when communism fell people wedded to old ideas of empire tried desperately to hold on to control over vast areas of diverse peoples as a result a long war and brutality and massive crimes against humanity occurred on both sides of the conflict how much better if all parties in the conflict had embraced the ethic that all people have a right to self rule and self expression in their own regions take for example two of the many peoples trapped in the old yugoslavia the serbians and the croatians even though serbians may have dominated the government of yugoslavia to effectively control other peoples such a totalitarian state must suppress the natural differences in people and force a regimentation and conformity so even the serbian people lost some of their unique identity as well as the other peoples over whom they ruled people now warmly embrace the right of serbians and croatians to be themselves and rule themselves globalism is a continuation of yugoslavian totalitarianism on a global scale ironically the serbians and the croatians and indeed all of us face globalist tyrants demanding to control the economy of serbia and croatia their currencies controlled by new york and london rather than by their own people and increasingly they are subject to a media controlled by hollywood and new york rather than the spirit of their own traditional heritage and values and in the height of insanity the globalists are eyeing mass immigration into both serbia and croatia of massive numbers of noneuropean immigrants who are far more fundamentally different than serbs and croats a prescription for future human conflict the rights of both majorities and minorities there are many harmonious nations on earth that are overwhelmingly of one primary heritage with only minor differences among their inhabitants but nations corrupted by the globalist power and media elite and propagandized that humanity is one and not many go against the peoples will and usher in massive immigration of an alien population this process is almost always against the democratic will of the nations inhabitants as history repeatedly shows and then as the numbers increase and societal differences and conflicts and discord increase the globalists resort to the old totalitarian tactics of suppressing free speech free association and all kinds of human liberty even to the point of forbidding the public displays of the traditional culture of the vast majority a powerful example is how the american government has now made it illegal to display a christian christmas motif on public ground even in an overwhelmingly christian cultural nation america supposedly created by e pluribus unum out of the many one is now dominated by identity and ethnic politics the most powerful lobby in american politics by far is for instance the jewish lobby comprised of an ethnic group of two percent of the american people but driven by ethnic and religious supremacism jewish organizations lead the fight in the destruction of christian christmas traditions the political landscape of america is dominated by special interest groups to which every politician must now bow except of course the european american majority which must silently watch as its cultural traditions such as christmas are destroyed of course it goes far beyond christmas americans are experiencing increasing identity politics and division such as generated by massive illegal immigration the rights of small nations cannot be sacrificed on the international level it must be recognized as a crime against humanity for any imperial state to occupy another peoples lands for exploitation of its labor or resources where autonomy or independent regions are not possible a degree of autonomy is certainly possible where significant groups in an area can have community institutions schools and other structures oriented toward both their needs and their spirit it is time to stand for freedom for all peoples it is time to stand up to globalist destruction of biodiversity destruction of human diversity destruction of the earths indigenous cultures artistic expressions lifestyles traditions and independence zionist globalism is actually supremacism the globalists seek the destruction of every unique expression of humanity they want to destroy the unique character of your people and every people on the earth they seek to destroy the human diversity of the earth so they can more easily rule over all of us and market the same brands of junk movies media and music they want you and all of us to consume the same junk food from a world agribusiness and media that advertises it that not only destroys the planets ecosystems but destroys your health and the health of hundreds of millions of people spawning epidemics of obesity heart disease diabetes and other ills they want to control the value of the currency in your pocket and force you and your nation under a corrupt zionistcontrolled global banking system that exploits you and all of us and put whole nations and peoples as slaves in a perpetual debt they want to put you and all of us under a soulless globalist government that takes away your freedom and that of every people and every nation and these globalists want war perpetual wars and conflicts in their attempts to expand their power over the earth and over all people they grow stronger by divide and conquer tactics and they seek to stamp out human diversity and seek to regiment all of humanity to their new world order all while the new york centered globalist media supports israel as a quote jewish state and supports zionist control of the international banks and the globalist media so in reality zionistdriven globalism is actually form of jewish supremacism globalism is imperialism on a global level and the greatest threat to human freedom diversity and independence in all of world history yes to freedom yes to diversity and independence but my dear friends all over the world in my homeland of america and that of my brethren in europe but among all freedom loving people across the globe millions of us say no to globalism we say yes to freedom yes to human diversity and independence we say no to globalist wars such as the iraq war the afghanistan war the planned war on iran horrific wars that are part of the zionist globalist agenda we say no to the zionist dominated globalist media that spout the lies that fuel these wars we say yes to a free internet and the freedom of people create their own media literature music and art forms no longer will we drink the toxic poisons of the globalist elite we say no to globalism yes to human freedom yes to human diversity yes to world of peace and prosperity we say yes to every peoples striving to preserve their way of life their particular heritage their particular expression of humanity whether we are kurds or pakistanis or iranians or palestinians whether we are chinese or japanese or africans or indians or of european heritage we say no to globalism we say yes to human freedom and global diversity we say yes to the peoples of our own nations and societies determining our destiny we say no to the global corporations and huge imperial powers wiping out human diversity in pursuit of their ungodly power we say yes to preserving our heritage and our way of life yes to our independence and freedom no matter who we are or where we live upon the earth we are humanity we are many because we honor our own heritage and traditions we honor every heritage and tradition because we value our own freedom and independence we value the freedom and independence of every people on earth because we refuse to be economically exploited we pledge not to exploit other s just as most europeans now want to preserve their own heritage and cultures we refuse to support the globalists who seek to use us to control and exploit other nations around the world because we love peace we refuse to support their zionistdriven globalist wars a new paradigm of human rights this is a new affirmation of human rights a new paradigm it is the human freedom movement and it is found wherever there are free people who desire to preserve their heritage and freedom it is found where people yearn for human societies allowed to be as naturally diverse as the biodiversity in nature the globalists have global economic media political and military power but we represent the true desires of humanity for freedom we represent the natural desires of every majority population to want to preserve the character of their nation and people and every minority population who seeks more freedom and autonomy in their own communities or regions human diversity freedom and independence we must resist rule of the globalists over us with a global coalition of mutually free peoples we are rising in every nation our paradigm for human freedom and diversity is growing among people all over the world the globalists cannot rule over us without our consent they cannot defeat us if we rise in defense of human freedom and diversity not just for ourselves but as a new principle for all mankind good for all people on this planet the principles we stand for we hold for our own people and for every people on the face the earth this is the world i am committed to the humanity i am committed to the nation in my own land that i am committed to i hope you join me in this quest for a new paradigm for humanity a new commitment to human freedom and diversity dr david duke postscript as i publish this most recent updated edition zionist jewish supremacists are committing mass murder against the

is one of the most rewarding hobbies a man could pursue ness nomadison ness is a thirtysomething american with almost a decade of experience living and traveling across asia hes a strong believer in pursuing ones passions continual selfimprovement and just being the best man he can be he runs his own website nessthenomadcom november lifestyle have you ever had a curiosity in photography yet you werent sure if its a hobby really worthy of your limited time then this article was written for you as i was also once in your shoes i picked up a dslr camera for the first time back in which awoke a passion inside me that i never even knew was there three and half years later im here to tell you just a few of the many benefits and realizations ive experienced by taking on this timeless hobby here are eight reasons photography might just be the most meaningful hobby youve overlooked your entire life an opportunity to flex your creative muscle in order to be balanced human beings i believe people need to be physically healthy spiritually awake and creatively expressive photography just like writing and film is a selfless way to be creative while also giving something back to the world the way we interpret our world changes from individual to individual and photography provides a medium for people to express themselves ask ten different photographers to photograph the same thing a city for example and be prepared to see ten wildly different visions of the same subject in our sensoryoverload world it feels good to create something thats uniquely you appreciate and understand your surroundings more i now find myself seeing everything around me in rectangular framesa takeaway from having to frame so many pictures over the years oh those people over there would fit perfectly into a box or that building over there would look perfect boxed in from this angle my eyes are now sharper than ever but i also find myself observing and appreciating all the little things around me i always have to keep my camera nearby because i often want to photograph something ive noticed in my daily routine the pattern on a sewer lid a reflection in a puddle birds perched in a tree and so forth my prephotographer self just like most of the rest of the world would have walked right past these things without a care in the world yet now i can be entertained from the most minuscule and simple things especially if my camera is handy the world is full of photogenic things if can just teach yourself to notice them help preserve history since its inception photography has always been one of the most moving ways to preserve history in our rapidly changing modern times photos touch people in a way other media cant both photography and video are both visual arts but photographs differ in that they capture merely one frame of what is going on yet one frame is all one needs to feel taken back to another time with the advent of the smartphone photography is as accessible as ever while this sounds good on paper the truth is our worlds becoming more and more flooded with garbage and narcissistic photographs our world needs more adventurous and welltrained photographers out there taking photos of the modern world we live in and the rapid changes its undergoing these are the photos that will be cherished decades down the road not all the shitty selfies that bog down social media travel experiences will be more meaningful photography goes with traveling like bread goes with butter it took me nearly five years of traveling internationally to finally get serious about doing photography on my trips and after i got started i never looked back rather than traveling for escapism and hedonism im traveling to learn about and document our world as a result my trips feel much more meaningful and fulfilling than they ever did before the way you see and come to understand a country as a photographer is quite different than if you werent one i now divide my history of travel experiences into two separate groupsthe trips i had before i owned a dslr camera and the trips i had after buying one photography is so fun and addicting that i find myself wanting to go back to all those predslr camera destinations even the ones i didnt enjoy all that much just so i can reexperience them with a camera in hand an opportunity to meet new people one thing i always try to do when i travel is meet fellow photographers whether they be foreign or local i appreciate talking to people with an observational eye as they can provide me with unique insight that nonphotographers rarely can but photography doesnt just help you meet other photographers it helps you meet other people from all walks of life ive had regular people on the street come up and talk to me once they saw i was taking photos ive also met people from online for no other reason than they liked my work being a good photographer can also be a great way to meet women theyre not gonna start blowing you as soon as they see your awesome pictures but dont be surprised if you discover some newfound female admiration once your excellent photography skills are out in the open and if you can make a woman look beautiful in a photo shell admire you in a way you never imagined a blog with an edge in the diverse world of independently run blogs how many bloggers do you know who can both write well and photograph well i can literally only think of one and the fact that this blogger is just as good at utilizing a camera as he is at wielding a pen or rather a keyboard puts his website in a league of its own in terms of quality content though i still highly respect the good bloggers out there for their amazing writing skills and insights i think theyre doing both their readers and websites a great disservice by merely using stock photos or shitty shotwithacellphone photos in their articles readers can definitely tell the difference when a blogger takes all of their own photos with a nice dslr camera start taking nice dslrshot photos and see for yourself how they can enhance your articles theyll give you just that much more of an edge over all the other bloggers who dont youll also have an edge over of others on social media and dating sites since everyone else is posting lame smartphonetaken shots all over their social media accounts your dslrshot photos could shine like diamonds in the rough the same way you stand above of other men by lifting weights regularly the same advantage can be expected by not taking cheap shortcuts with your social mediabound photography your facebook instagram and twitter accounts will all look better than ever before this is also true for dating websites and apps where most chumps just take some lame mirror selfies with their smartphone and then upload them to their accounts dudes with welltaken nontraditional photos stand out big time dont just take my word for it as there has actually been plenty of discussion about these benefits over at the roosh v forum and although they can be very helpful you dont actually need another photographer with you to get some good shots of yourself rather all you need is your camera an autofocus lens a tripod a remote shutter and a creative eye a resumeenhancing marketable skill photography isnt just mentally rewarding it can also be financially rewarding if you play your cards right the field of profitable photography may be vast and highly competitive but one things for sure the demand for new photographs is infinite the world never stops turning after all stock portrait wedding wildlife travel sports and news photography are just a few of the most in demand and profitable niches but if you really wanna make money selling your photographs you gotta make a name for yourself by sharpening your skills and networking with the right people a great photographer who no one knows exists wont make any money my father is an outdoorsman slash wildlife photographer with decades of experience tens of thousands of photos and a giant network of contacts from his industry it seems like magazine and website editors are always knocking on his door because they know he probably has a nice shot of exactly what theyre looking for often all he has to do is dig through his archives and boomhes made bucks conclusion stop dreaming about it and just give photography a shot already borrow your friend or a family members dslr camera for the weekend and just get out there and take pictures of anything that strikes your fancy photography takes decades to master but it all begins with a single click of the shutter button yet sometimes all it takes is one little click to realize youve been missing out on something very big and meaningful your entire life youll never know until you try,1

candidate will take control of the country in january to fill his four year term violent protests are raging and attacks against those who oppose trump or fail to fit his criteria of acceptability are on the rise trump supporters have also been attacked to say the very least this is the dawning of a new age in america to put it mildly trump alienated huge swaths of humanity during his campaign women mexicans muslims blacks the media have all taken their turns at his whipping pole trumps harsh words have been used to condemn huge groups the only people trump hasnt attacked are white american males the only people trump hasnt attacked are white american males interestingly trump shares many traits with the man who brought germany to its knees during wwii adolph hitler hitler rallied germans by directing national anger toward two primary groups the communists and the jews trump rallied americans by directing high doses of anger toward mexico and muslims trumps perception of mexican immigrants is way off the mark as the majority of those who emigrate to the us are hard working people willing to perform roles most white americans avoid like field harvesting nonetheless trump has described them as rapists and criminals tossing a blanket over every human being who finds their way to the us through illegal means when it comes to muslims mr trump is exceptionally ignorant he fulfills the thoughts of those in the middle east who already believe the us has a long range plan to eliminate islam millions of americans are having a meltdown over the election of trump while those who supported his bid for presidency continue to express anger and simultaneously imitate trumps bully demeanor by attacking those who disagree with their point of view particularly in social media insults have never been so foul and widespread everyone is riled people are unsure of what to do it seems almost certain that things are going to get a lot worse before they could ever

his threat to dismantle obamacare one thing is certain donald trump is extremely willing to toss out ideas and positions and then change his mind the following day unfortunately trump did this when initially exposing the connection between barack obama and hillary clinton and isis it is an absolute fact that the united states was directly responsible for starting two more wars in the middle east

understanding of how obama and clinton operate it also speaks volumes about the dark ways that the us has been manipulated by the zionist government of israel a nation that drains us taxpayers of more than million a day the track record of human rights violations in israel goes well beyond unforgivable the isis expose was a golden moment for trump even though he didnt stick to his guns the wars the us has been waging in recent years are all unjustified conflicts used to make large amounts of money for groups like halliburton and mercenary organizations while the us government spends trillions on killing it has historically ignored the suffering its allies direct toward their own citizens one great example is saudi arabia the radical wahhabi government that still beheads people in public in strict violation of international lawthese problems have sullied us support for many years the only hope for the future lies in peace and reconciliation for clinton maintaining peace was a seemingly impossible task lest we forget it was her threats of war toward russia and iran that crossed the line for large numbers of americans parading as a liberal hillary clintons warmongering is legendary the democratic national committee debacle that derailed the only promising candidate bernie sanders was equally reprehensible in the end there were no good choices for us voters the protrump crowd may not feel as victorious once they realize that mr trump does not care about them in any way shape or form only days after the election it is already being announced that the tax cuts trump promised will only be a fraction of what he claimed it is reminiscent of former us president george bushs famous words read my lips no new taxes of course each man offered the promise as an election gimmick each time it was enough to convince republicans trump is here to promote his own needs and to meet his own goals perhaps some of his political moves will coincide with the wishes of his voters perhaps not in the meanwhile tempers are flaring and americans are increasingly turning against each other the real unavoidable truth is that donald trump will be the next us president he says he is going to make america great again and many of us wonder exactly what that means in the postwwii years there was peace unless you were black americans had freedom unless they were women or minorities the united states has always waged illegal wars dating back to the very beginning when one treaty with native people after another was broken is donald trump going to keep the us out of wars for the next four years it would be a very good thing if he did on one hand it seems entirely doubtful that the country will make it through four years of donald trump but giving up is not the answer if trump goes too far out of sync or becomes embroiled in charges that he cant pay off or threaten away there is an impeachment process that americans can follow,0

our political perspectives might be offputting to some readers on the left although you could tune out whatever you dont agree with you might do well to take a closer look not all of us agree on everything but we do have a rough consensus on some items our views on the political establishment the left blames corporations while the right blames the government when in reality the two interests work together to subvert the will of the people its pretty easy to see that this site has a mainly conservative perspective especially on social matters not all of us started out that way many of us began our journey away from the political orthodoxy after realizing what a mess feminism has made of society others have been turned off by political correctness once upon a time i used to be liberal and i know im not the only one be that as it may some of us are actually friendly to liberalism by the way we dont give a free pass to the mainstream conservative establishment either unfortunately the government in countless ways seeks to amass power for itself while producing fear and dependency in the populace really its not a democrat problem or republican problem theyre basically two sides of the same coin heads they win tails you lose surely youre in favor of progress one good question though is what exactly this constitutes also who gets to define what is progress all that might seem rhetorical but these are important matters likely you see change as a good thing but whos setting the agenda deciding which direction that change goes actually we have answers for all that in fact we might have some more in common with you than you expect dont care for agribusiness neither do we are you troubled by the influence of the ultrawealthy in the political process we are too do you suspect that the powerful have set up a system of managed democracy where theyre pulling the purse strings of both the republicans and the democrats if you supported bernie sanders youve probably figured that one out already we understand you todays political and social scene you might be disenchanted by some of the things going on with the democratic party today perhaps youve heard of their hypocrisy and contempt for the public are you troubled by some of the clinton scandals maybe even wondered if there was more to it than you expected perhaps your questioning goes deeper you might wonder who hijacked liberalism it once stood for helping the working man but some time in the s it turned into so much squabbling divisiveness actually theres a reason for that the culture war began long before the s that wasnt about liberation but rather a deliberate attempt to spread divisiveness and weaken the fabric of society also taxpayers have spent untold money on social programs but why dont they solve problems instead they create intergenerational poverty you might be shocked to learn that encouraging dependency along with taxing and spending to oblivion was actually a stratagem meant to crash the system thats not about helping the disadvantaged its about using them schemes like thesecausing societal upheaval so a socialist paradise will magically fall into placeare pretty reckless you might shake your head in bewilderment at online mobs of misguided youths spewing bile about things that dont really matter sure youre against police brutality as am i but deep down you also fear what will come of all this open contempt for the law and violence against police the authorities take a pretty dim view of cop killers kind of sounds like someone behind the scenes wants to start a lot of trouble doesnt it finally you might wonder if the people on top of the liberal establishment really give a damn about the common people we think its rotten that theyre using so many wellmeaning people for the cynical ends of amassing money and power likely you have some nagging concerns about whats going on in society today why are women both liberated and spoiled and sometimes even hostile cant the feminists see that things arent really so bad sure youre all about tolerance and have lots of gay friends but you privately wonder if there should be sensible limits you might be uncomfortable with all the evangelizing of alternative lifestyles especially if you have children in school you consider the press to be the bedrock of a free society but you have doubts about journalistic integrity hey we understand the propaganda is everywhere even in shows for young children the media has been feeding you bullshit all your life and we think their lying is rotten you deserve better than that starting to reconsider a diehard social justice warrior will seethe with rage for me bringing up these uncomfortable facts even if youre a moderate you might be reluctant to consider any of this we understand rethinking deeply held beliefs is a painful process for so many things youll see that what youve been told is right is actually wrong and what is wrong is really right many on the left have been there before and found their way out for me someone explained that im not responsible for the worlds problems its not your fault the endless attempts in college to ram opinions down my throat hardened my resolve others whove made the journey have different stories some got religion others realized that their past fanaticism has hurt others some wondered why decades of costly social programs havent accomplished anything some came to see that preferential treatment in hiring decisions is anything but fairness its in your best interests to purge the misconceptions and guilt trips from your mind still you dont have to abandon everything and embrace the polar opposite some have reached a synthesis position welcome to the other side if youve read this far with an open mindand checked out some of the referenced articlesthen you might be confused perhaps youre tempted to reject our message on the other hand you might be shocked and even angry about whats been going on in politics and society we understand enlightenment is a painful process were here for you the truth hurts but well do the best we can to tell it like it is which is much more than can be

fought against the big banks weve fought against the satanic pedophile elites and weve fought against the corrupt mainstream media but the battle is not over yet we still have much to do if we wish to make america great again this will not be an easy fight for we will certainly face much resistance along the way expect the cucks and liberals to throw temper tantrums as their safe spaces come tumbling down expect the mainstream media to demonize the altright and expect the elites to do everything they can to stop us they will not stop us thoughno we are far too powerful the wheels of truth do in fact turn slowly but alas they turn and they are growing in speed as we blaze towards victory here are four goals that we must achieve on our path to victory dismantle the mainstream media as more and more of us start to wake up the media will begin to sense thisin fact they already have have you wondered why theyve started to cover antihillary stories its because they realize that theyre losing credibility the mainstream media is very well aware that theyre losing their chokehold on the american publics mind so in a last ditch effort theyre trying to seem unbiased do not buy into their liesits all a giant farce an attempt to regain their former credibility over the next four years it will be extremely important to start dismantling these outlets its time to call them out for what they are start sharing altright stories on facebook and twitter get our message out there dont watch any mainstream media dont buy mainstream magazines dont watch their news shows hell dont even pay for cable do everything you can to bleed their pockets dry as more and more money moves away from the mainstream media it will naturally move towards alternative news sourcessites like return of kings info wars matt forney and danger and play will become the new media dont expect this to happen at first however in one final cry before its gory death the media will proclaim that there is a new racist xenophobic enemy that helped donald get into office the altright expect them to demonize us expect them to lie about us to scream and shout and to protest this is fine howeverfor we are antifragile the altright is in a very unique position any and all hatred towards the altright will be a net win for us why its simple any publicity is good publicity a single mention of an alternative news site by the msm can and often does net us tens of thousands of new viewers in other words if they ignore us we continue to grow in power if they attack us we grow even faster they cant win drain the swamp everything that weve done up to this point to get donald in office will be completely pointless if we dont drain the swamp this is our one chancewe have four years to do this in order for us to bring about permanent change in this country we need to hold the cucks and libtards accountable for their actions anyone who pushed the proislam agenda rape culture or feminazi philosophy must be called out for the traitors that they are the elites the corrupt bankers and the globalists must all be brought to light in order for us to bring about true change and to prevent a globalist dictatorship from happening in the near future we must ensure that at least of americans are aware of the elites conspiracy by the next election this is a grass roots movement and it is growing in powerbut we must take away power from those who tried so hard to fight us now is the time to cause a ruckus and email your representatives now is the time to demand hillary be thrown in prison every single person involved in hillary clintons private email server must be thrown in jail pedophiles and satanists such as anthony weiner and marina abramovic and traitors such as huma abedin and comey must be thrown in jail for their crimes now is the time to clear out the murky watersto sift through the dirt and rotten garbage lurking below i believe that once all is said and done america will enter into a new age of prosperity the patriarchy will return normalize straight males for too long have men been oppressed by the very civilization which we created we have let the sjws and culture warriors back us into a corner but weve finally started to fight back more and more men upon being exposed to the manosphere are starting to wake up and take the red pill were starting to realize as a nation that there is no reason to be ashamed of being white or being a man once we start to dismantle the mainstream media and drain the swamp most of this should happen naturallyit was only through the artificial social engineering that being a white male became a crime but we cant stop hereits time to start slowly redpilling our bluepilled friends the best way to do this is simply through osmosis dont try to convince them with logic because they did not arrive at a bluepilled position through logic they did so through emotion simply be a beacon of masculinity be confident in yourself be assertive and dont cave into ridiculous hr requests or political correctness social pressures again once the mainstream media is dismantled and the manosphere grows in popularity our movement will gain strength exponentially the normalization of males especially white males is essential for our culture to continuethe second that we started to become ashamed of our heritage and of our nationality was the second that the cucks started closing in we cannot give them an inch or they will take a mile this is not to say that our country shouldnt accept immigrantsif they go through the legal process how did it get so far that it became socially unacceptable to shame illegal immigrants again illegal immigrants like i said it got this way due to an overwhelming amount of white guilt do not be ashamed of your heritage men we have made a gigantic step towards national sovereignty with donald trump being elected as president and we cannot let this victory go in vain we must push onward and continue to normalize what is normal being a straight male white or note should be the norm not being a transgender greenhaired sjw get the law on our side as our grass roots movement picks up more and more steam i believe that the pressure we create will naturally push judges and lawmakers to change our corrupt legal system first things first we must create laws that treat men and women as they should be treated too many laws are skewed in favor of women now that women have the right to work we must remove alimonyits ridiculous that men should have to pay a month to their exwives because she got used to a certain living situation we must remove corrupt antimale divorce laws ridiculous hatespeech laws which infringe on our freedom of speech and ultimately sjw rape laws i along with many other rok men have been falsely accused of rape its time to remove all of these ridiculous laws that make it illegal for men to simply talk to women and that were built into the system by the elites in order to wage war against men the law should encourage freedom of speech the fact that twitter has not been held accountable for banning milo yiannopoulos is absolutely absurd information and social media platforms should be held to the same standards that the american people are google needs to stop censoring search resultsand if they dont its time for us to create laws against this type of behavior allowing google to filter search results is like a regression back to medieval times for one entity to selectively edit our version of reality is unacceptable most importantly judges and lawmakers that have taken bribes should be thrown in jailindefinitely anyone who took a donation from george soros or any other member of the bilderberg group should be imprisoned for crimes of treason summary we are on the path towards victory menbut it will not be without many hiccups the first thing that the mainstream media will do is demonize the altright but again this will only make us stronger it will expose our view points to a larger audience expect it to get darker just before the dawn expect feminists sjws cucks and libtards to protest and scream and shoutbut it will all be in vain too many men are starting to wake up too many men are starting to see the lies that have been shoved down our throats and there is no going back the next four years will be more important than ever our primary objective is to dismantle the mainstream media through natural means its time for them to be exposed as the liars that they are simply eliminating the msm will be most of the battleremember this is a war of information and when the altright starts to control the news there will be sanity we must also focus on draining the swamp we must rid our corrupt political establishment of the people whove betrayed us we must normalize the family unit and white menno longer shall we feel ashamed of our gender or sexual orientation then from here the laws must change remember this will not be easy there will be much resistance along the way but weve come this far weve beat all odds and elected trump as the president of our nationand its time to make america great again read more are you on pace to reach your goals,1

the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb put forward a proposal to regulate the shortterm loan industry the small dollar lending rule seeks to alleviate and solve for the apparent weaknesses of the current rates and shortterm lenders by requiring lenders to assess and verify a borrowers income housing costs and credit and legal obligations the intention of the proposal is to protect lowincome families from being caught in an endless cycle where many are forced to take out another loan to make ends meet at first glance it seems that the rule would solve problems in an industry known for its dirtiness except policymakers are thinking with their hearts while sitting in their airconditioned offices away from the facts and any form of interaction with the real world of shortterm loans just the fact that they see the shortterm loan industry as dirty supplies sufficient reason to believe that either these policymakers are ignorantly prejudiced or plainly manipulative instead of pointing fingers and name calling at the shortterm lending industry they should be applying simple economics to their proposals to see if they hold water in understanding the cfpb proposal for payday and other small loans a paper released by the cfpb and pew charitable trusts the bureau aimed to make several arguments in favor of new legislation the first of its arguments is that with payday and vehicle title loan markets lenders and borrowers interests are not aligned because profitability for lenders depends on loans being unaffordable for customers but doesnt this argument stand for any industry that sells a product for example are the interests of iphone sellers and buyers aligned in the manner acceptable to the cfpb each additional iphone is said to cost to produce and is sold for dollars that is times its cost to make to borrow a phrase from the left thats pricegouging to the tune of percent yet there is no noise from policymakers claiming to call apple a company that cheats its customers so why should shortterm lenders be held accountable in any way that is different than apple shouldnt shortterm lenders be able to charge interest rates that makeup for the huge risk they incur in lending money out to lowincome borrowers studies show these lenders charge on average percent or for every loaned a profit margin that is significantly less than the price percentage difference of products in other markets the second of the cfpbs arguments is that to solve for balloon payments or the cycle of continued borrowing to pay off loans the cfpb would require that most products become installment loans with smaller manageable payments the problem with this statement is that the bureau completely ignores the reason why shortterm loans are so available to borrowers its because shortterm loan companies can offset risk by requiring borrowers to weigh their own risk against their need to borrow simply put the short payment periods are put in place to deter those who definitely should not borrow additionally making the periods longer and the payments smaller defeats the business model making shortterm lenders irrelevant because their models are defined by their expediency the third of the cfpbs arguments is that their proposal would solve the problems related to price gouge lending by requiring lenders to evaluate borrowers financial condition by forcing borrowers to submit written statements on income housing expenses all outstanding debt and child support meanwhile the lender is required to obtain a national credit report and then deliver that data to all proposed credit tracking agencies remember all of these governmentimposed requirements cost the shortterm lenders money the cost of finding out this data would eliminate any ability that firms have to loan small amounts of cash at current interest rates the result would either lead shortterm loan companies to shut down or further hurt borrowers by requiring that they borrow larger sums of money to qualify for loans lastly the cfpb heralds that their redesign is prompted by a study by the pew charitable trusts survey research that the vast majority of borrowers want most products to become installment loans with smaller manageable payments at first glance it seems that borrowers in need are hurting and want to find a way out of a difficult situation although there are those who are caught in the inability to pay back loans because they got caught in bad finance due to the risk of shortterm loans many of those surveyed actually sent in raving reviews in support of shortterm loans in fact more than percent of the submissions to the bureaus tell your story program where people sent in their experiences regarding shortterm loans were positive and excessively thankful for these loans these responses ranged from there are no other avenues out there that can lend money like this to a simple thank you this study was personally conducted by the cfpb unsatisfied with the results they hid it from the publics view until a freedom of information act request forced them to release it this holding back of information demonstrates that the bureau is not truly searching to help the people it says it wants to help rather they have a keen eye for policy symbolism and the flash of fighting for the underdog when in fact they are irreversibly harming them while sticking a knife in their back policymakers continue the belief that shortterm loans are as bad as they seem comes either because they did not attend their economics classes in college or they simply want to be perceived as someone who cares but we cannot let policymakers make decisions because their hearts lead them to make uneducated proposals we cannot let legislators sway our hearts because we hear about the extreme situations where people are hurt instead we need to look at the coldhard facts the numbers that the cfpb uses to defend their arguments are manipulative and outright false the small dollar lending rule must not be allowed to pass and the proposal must be removed and taken back it will only hurt the people it claims it will help let americans make decisions for themselves theyre smarter and more riskaverse than washington insiders give them credit for jonathan lee is a filmmaker and freelance economics journalist he is an alumnus

donald trumps claim he is reinvestigating is just so much meaningless hot air more neocon crapola if he intends to solve the greatest crime in american history by including two of the events participating perpetrators rudy giuliani and lewis eisenberg on his team of detectives what kind of truth can we expect from this kind of sandbagged scrutiny none at all once again our government is investigating itself with predictable results it will do no better than the first time which was a total whitewash because it is the very system itself that all these political functionaries are trying to defend which bears responsibility for this event and its impact on history hiring the people who played minor supporting roles in the bloodbath to identify its architects and actors may yield a few sacrificial scapegoats like cheney and some generals but the top of the line power structure will remain solidly in place hidden from view and utterly in control of world events that trump has surrounded himself with the tainted players who have carried out all these wars for israel augurs for a dark future in which the militarization of america will further shrink individual rights and the harsh crackdown on legitimate dissent which will soon be banned plainly signals the end of free speech as we have known it in the united states recall thomas jeffersons dictum freedom of the press cannot be limited without being lost today it is long gone the press prints only what the government allows it to print for trump to hire such rancid refugees from the bush administration means that he wont be investigating instead he will be crafting a new more realistic coverup that lambastes saudi renegades and totally omits the overwhelming presence of israeli jews in all aspects of the tragedy the same presence that now dominates the us government and its criminal activities throughout the world preemptive war is criminal activity in case you didnt know the us is practicing it everywhere under the cynical guise of fighting terror which it itself creates by hiring thugs from around the world to fit into the proper terror slots and become believable enemies for the press to vilify and our military to bomb the us has literally slaughtered millions of people around the world at the behest of a small group of mostly jewish men and the gentiles they have bought who control not only virtually all the money of the people in the world but also control their thoughts as a result mayor giuliani ran the command post in building you remember building that building that was knocked down by not being hit by an airplane giuliani knows everything that happened and who did what eisenberg one of the worlds foremost financiers was the head of the new york port authority who leased the twin towers to silverstein silverstein who spoke frequently with top israeli leaders wound up with billion the question with regard to trumps integrity kind of splits down the middle since he seems to have a genuine desire to succeed and restore the peace but he is indebted to forces far larger than himself which he is now trying to placate by surrounding himself with the traditional pseudo republican goons like gingrich and romney if only they were genuine republicans it wouldnt be so bad but theyre poseurs all ultimately working for the rockefellers and the rothschilds business as usual in the jewish american empire gnawing on the fatted calf while bleeds trumps choices reveal a desire to continue the swashbuckling sadism of the bush administration throughout his campaign i always shuddered when trump would proclaim that we needed a stronger military and i thought tell that to the people beneath the bombs because they want no part of any of this as a newspaper blows trivial events into earthshaking issues so politicians identify all manner of enemies that demonstrate the desperate need for them to be elected like the boston marathon bombing that turned a mercenary drill into a region wide suspension of freedom of movement the worst story possible is presented even as inconvenient facts are left behind think about the atrocities and false flag shockers that have been foisted on us since statistics reveal that more than of significant terror incidents began life as fbi sting operations manipulating low iq bigmouths into capital crimes why is it the cops can commit crimes against the people but the people cant commit crimes against the cops this is not the kind of freedom we thought wed get while growing up trump certainly is not addressing any of these issues and a trump administration will merely continue the clumsy depredations and smokescreen lies that have exemplified the utterly corrupt and criminal nature of the united states as it is run by jews bankers holed up in the city of london and wreaking havoc throughout the world by their control of everyones money what is really needed is a full accounting of what the jews have done to the united states and restitution to united states citizens over moneys illegally stolen by the federal reserve corporation to be taken from its stockholders immediately of course this is impossible because the jews own the government and all the corrupt minions within it one word from them and youre out of a job the avaricious jews are really only a reflection of the darker side of humanity like good sociopaths they learned everything they know by mimicking others and have become better than everyone else at what they do simply by practice and cooperation they have never once considered that the fate of the world ultimately depends on treating everyone in the world as members of your own family even as that becomes impossible on a continent overrun by hungry savages who were put there by these very same sadists who control the united states and its fearsome war machine a war machine that is now being used against its own people through media medicine and food as the people who control

research october the media has failed to address the confrontation between the us state department and the joint chiefs of staff the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford image right has warned both the us senate as well secretary of state john kerry in no uncertain terms that a no fly zone over syria would lead to war with both syria and russia intimating a dangerous process of military escalation in a senate arms services committee hearing dunford said responding to questions from republican senator roger whicker mississippi right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make senate armed services committee september emphasis added at the third presidential debate hillary clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president she would implement a noflyzone intimating that the objective was to save lives i think a nofly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict i am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general clinton said in response to a question from fox news debate moderator chris wallace this would not be done just on the first day this would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the russians and syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground i think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the russians and the syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in syria fox news emphasis added at present under the obama administration the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the no fly zone the joint chiefs of staff are appointed by the secretary of defense under a clinton presidency a new secretary of defense as well as a new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff firmly committed to a no fly zone over syria would be appointed michèle angelique flournoy a former under secretary of defense for policy is hillarys choice for the position of secretary of defense who favors the no fly zone option according to defense one the woman expected to run the pentagon under hillary clinton said she would direct us troops to push president bashar alassads forces out of southern syria and would send more american boots to fight the islamic state in the region confirmed by the leaked emails michele flournoy is a crony of the clintons she has called for limited military coercion to help remove assad from power in syria including a no bombing zone over parts of syria held by usbacked rebels this is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including isis daesh from actions by syrian and russian forces according to defense one flournoy and several of her colleagues at the center for new american security or cnas have been making the case for sending more american troops into combat against isis and the assad regime than the obama administration has been willing to commit since russias increased involvement the facts on the ground in syria she said do not support the kind of negotiated conditions we would like to get to us policy should be the removal of assad even if that meant using limited military coercion flournoy said at mondays annual cnas conference in washington flournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased us intervention for instance she acknowledged her support for us strikes using standoff weapons to retaliate against syrian military targets to enforce the nobomb zone the press reports however did not quote the details of the discussion and testimony of general dunford and secretary of defense carter at the arms services committee hearing let me see if the chairman wants to add anything senator wicker well let me just ask this if you dont mind secretary carter it would help if the barrel bombing ended and i spoke to a democratic colleague of mine today ive been calling for a nofly zone to stop the barrel bombing and i asked this colleague of mine on the other side of the aisle if he would support that and he said yes he said i want to call it something else rather than a nofly zone but that this particular senator it is a fact that this particular senator has now changed his position and would like us to take action to present to prevent the barrel bombing what is your position about that and wouldnt it help if we took decisive action and ended this carnage secretary carter i dont know the specific proposal which youre discussing with your colleague ill make one comment and see if the chairman wants to add anything senator wicker i think he was talking about a nofly zone secretary carter well okay senator wicker but described in more palatable terms secretary carter there are a number of different proposals have been made but i the one that i think it the focus on right now is the one secretary kerrys trying to promote namely a nofly zone for the russians and the syrians who are attacking the syrian people if theyre talking about a nofly zone for american aircraft fighting isil needless to say that thats not going to get any enthusiasm get strong opposition from me senator wicker im speaking about a secretary carter but i think thats what a but its not called that but secretary kerry is trying to get a standdown of the syrian and russian air force and if hes successful that would be a good thing let me ask the chairman if he has anything to add general dunford senator the only thing id say is you know as the situation on the ground changes i think i have a responsibility we the joint force has a responsibility to make sure the president has a full range of options we have discussed that issue in the past under certain conditions the conditions on the ground will change and well continue to look at those options and make sure theyre available to the president senator wicker what about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped general dunford all options senator wicker what do you think of that option sir general dunford right now senator for all of the airspace in syria it would require war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make concluding remarks from the above testimonies and statements one thing is clear decisionmakers at highest levels of the us government and the military believe in their own propaganda they are not able to reflect on their actions outside the realm of propaganda and this also applies to nuclear warfare which is presented as a peacemaking operation it is unlikely that any drastic action regarding a no fly zone will be taken under the obama administration prior to the november elections and the instatement of a new president of the us in january consequently the next three months will be absolutely crucial for syria ie during this period the counterterrorism campaign waged by syria with the support of russia and iran will seek to eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and pacify the entire country the footsoldiers of the western military alliance will be defeated on the ground if this objective is achieved it will inevitably have an impact on us options regarding the proposed deployment of groundforces and the no fly zone what prevails however is an attempt on the part of washington to redeploy its isis terrorist footsoldiers in mosul by transferring them from iraq to syria the original

likely come under fire is sanctuary cities cities with policies that make them safe havens for illegal aliens the issue became frontandcenter during the early portion of the republican primary when trump decried the murder of kate steinle by an illegal alien in san francisco a sanctuary city in response to the election of trump leftist city leaders are digging in officials in los angeles chicago and boston signaling that they will not cooperate with the federal governments deportation efforts here are five things you need to know about sanctuary cities sanctuary cities are a blatant violation of federal law some on the left have tried to claim that theyre perfectly legal but this is clearly false as james walsh former associate general counsel of immigration and naturalization services explains usc section deals with those persons who knowingly conceal harbor or shield undocumented aliens and could apply to officials in sanctuary cities and states the fact that leftists are digging their heels in on sanctuary cities means theyre supporting a form of nullification an irony not missed by victor davis hanson much of the rural west opposes the endangered species act can wyoming declare that federally protected rats and bugs are not protected inside its state borders when such pests obstruct construction of dams or highways many conservatives oppose federal restrictions on gun sales could oklahoma city declare handgun purchases within its citylimits free of federal firearms statutes perhaps little rock could ignore a supreme court ruling and announce that gay marriage is not legal within its jurisdiction on what rationale would liberals in california object to such nullifications that neither state nor city had the right to ignore a federal law or to obstruct the law enforcement duties of federal officials trump and the gop can fight against sanctuary cities by cutting off federal funding and sending in federal agents to mandate the cities to follow the law sanctuary cities undermine law enforcement not only do they refuse to cooperate with federal agents in deporting illegals sanctuary cities make it more difficult for police officers to do their job some police officers in the los angeles police department lapd expressed their frustration with the citys sanctuary city policy to heather mac donald in we cant even talk about it says a frustrated lapd captain people are afraid of a backlash from hispanics another lapd commander in a predominantly hispanic ganginfested district sighs i would get a firestorm of criticism if i talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals in that piece mac donald documents how members of the lapd were able to recognize known gang members but couldnt do anything to apprehend them until they had committed a crime despite the fact that they were illegals who repeatedly snuck back into the country this is the case with other sanctuary cities as well sanctuary cities are akin to roulette the odds suggest that most illegal aliens detained by officials are not career felons and thus supposedly need not be turned over to ice for deportation writes hanson on the chance that some of their released criminals will go on to commit further crimes in the manner of juan lopezsanchez officials then shrug that the public outcry will be episodic and quickly die down or will at least not pose political problems as great as would come from deporting aliens but the odds dont suggest this hanson notes that according to mac donald twothirds of all outstanding felony warrants in the city of los angeles involved illegal aliens as well as of outstanding murder warrants additionally jessica vaughn of the center for immigration studies found that in a ninemonth timeframe in sanctuary cities shielded illegals from deportation percent of which had significant prior criminal histories and of them were subsequently rearrested for new crimes according to daniel horowitz at conservative review there is no telling how many have committed crimes and were never caught writes horowitz this is just a ninemonth snapshot of the devastation from sanctuary policies as of last year of them were still at large so much for not being a flight risk according to vaughn from january to september sanctuary cities rebuked over detainers percent of which involved individuals with a prior criminal history based on these statistics it would seem that the odds are against the cities residents who could be harmed by criminal aliens which makes it no surprise that crime has surged in sanctuary cities the daily wire s hank berrien reported on the following from louisiana attorney general jeff landry according to louisiana attorney general jeff landry crime has risen in sanctuary cities across the nation landry told the house judiciary committees subcommittee on immigration and border security that sanctuary city policies allow illegals to commit crimes then roam free in our communities landrys appearance was prompted by the changed status of new orleans where city police are now banned from asking an individuals immigration status using recent statistics from los angeles another sanctuary city landry asserted los angeles saw all crime rise in violent crime up percent homicides up percent shooting victims up percent rapes up percent robberies up percent and aggravated assault up percent sanctuary cities encourage further illegal immigration and promote an underground economy that sabotages the tax base this would make sense given the aforementioned statistics and the fact that there is a clear link between illegal immigration and crime there are an estimated sanctuary cities counties and states according to vaughn the full map on such jurisdictions can be seen here do you live in a sanctuary city,1

trump because i liked where he wanted us to go i did say i was interested in the anger of the bernie sanders and donald trump voters on election night a bbc reporter tried to explain how hillary lost that state which has a huge black vote and lots of technically advanced people from out of state in what americans call researchtriangle park obama went there in a last ditch effort to get out the vote he was popular there amongst the college students they had voted for him in but not so much for hillary in the bbc reporter told us the people who lived there said they were all bernie voters they had zero enthusiasm for hillary i previously quoted mike rivero who had said that if hillary clinton were running in november against godzilla the lizard would have his vote we have seen the hillary koolaid drinkers go crazy after donald won they all live in bubbles where it would have been career suicide to say you voted against hillarys pay for pay corruption i have seen a lot of domestic antitrump propaganda from the far right because donald is a zionist i agree with donald that we should stop funding isis and let vladimir putin take them down it was obama who armed isis and let a small band become an international menace overnight by allowing them to take mosul in and refusing to let the usaf take them out on that highway from syria but i do disagree with donalds intention to confront iran for what resisting zionism but fortunately for iran what trump and americas rulers want will soon become irrelevant of course that is not good news for americans who blindly follow the people who think they own the government of the united states i have just now seen from europe sheer postelection idiocy some are claiming that donald trump is the puppet of the fourth reich and is backed by the same industrialists and money men that had elevated adolf hitler to the chancellorship in it is silly to think that the rockefellers and the rothschilds backed trump i do admit that america is run by a criminal elite i had written that catherine austin fitts said the us military and intelligence services had given donald a green light to dish out dirt on hillary these men were on the inside of the vile mechanism that runs america but even they thought hillary was one witch too far to go i have reported on the elite end game many times before their plan is far worse

according to david rothkopf the former ceo of kissinger associates and author of superclass fortunately for us the people of the us and europe are learning to resist i voted once in a presidential election where the democrat was a member of the trilateral commission headed by david rockefeller in north america and sir evelyn de rothschild in europe the republican was a member of the bilderberg society headed by sir evelyn de rothschild in europe and headed by david rockefeller in north america you never read that in our corporate media please do not call those people who run hollywood and our tv news nazis they are either jewish or work for jewish companiesthe direct ties of those who thought they were born to rule over us are more to banking than to industry they are not nazis the transhumanist depopulation agenda ld in a breakthrough interview on the transhumanist agenda and the presidential election catherine austin fitts former us assistant housing secretary and publisher of the solari report spoke of the engineered rise of autism gmo proliferation the expansion of entrainment technology the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics and the dumbing down of american students with common core see here these were all she argued part of an overarching conspiracy to promote a massive transhumanist depopulation agenda this would be achieved by an engineered economic armageddon leading to mass starvation food riots and race wars that would wipe billions of people off the face of the planet how soon this apocalyptic scenario is likely to unfold is anyones guess any moment now many doomsayers declare the coming of donald trump is regarded by many as an omen of the end days ld vid rebel continues catherine austin fitts said the bankers stole trillion from us i think they stole a lot more the bankers gave themselves the right to charge us interest on money they created out of nothing in when they founded the bank of england america copied the bank of england and the german central bank when they drafted the legislation for the federal reserve in it became law in just in time for america to create enough unpayable debt at interest to fund ww i the united states entered ww i because the elite did not want the allies to accept germanys offer to stop the fighting in the elite wanted the war to last long enough to bankrupt britain and france to set up a jewish communist dictatorship in russia and to make palestine a british colony for the jews none of that benefited voters in europe or america and the bought and paid for media cannot understand why we despise both them and the families that sent them we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january the elite stole all of our pensions and savings they sold hundreds of trillions in bad bets otherwise known as credit default swaps just so they could pocket tens of trillions of dollars in premiums dont cry for them they made people like you ie taxpayers liable for the inevitable consequences for their actions just add another few hundred trillion dollars onto the pile of unpayable debts to be taken out of your pension fund your savings your bank account and your paycheck their malfeasance will become your obligation in the very near future at least that is what they are planning the bankers gave you a system in which you cannot have money unless you go into debt the federal reserve will not issue paper money until the treasury gives them a bond obligating us to pay them interest on money they created out of nothing you cannot have checking account money until someone takes out a loan and is willing to pay the bankers interest on money they created out of nothing if we had lincolns noninterest bearing greenbacks we would not have trillion in national debt and be paying billion a year in taxes to pay the resulting interest the recent sharp rise in the interest rate on year treasury bonds means our financial system is near collapse a depression is a period in time when unpayable debts are cancelled en masse since we foolishly have a debt based system that means money vanishes every time a debt is discharged in foreclosure or in bankruptcy court it is this sudden sharp contraction in the money supply that creates all the unemployment i have quoted dr steve keen many times before we are headed to the worst financial crisis in the past five centuries because we have more unpayable debts to cancel than at any time in the past years so what is worse than the fourth reich tens of millions of americans starving to death or killing their neighbors because they have nothing to eat in short a race war to end all wars of course this is what americas elite had planned for them they stole all of the pension funds and the savings they created the trade deals that closed manufacturing plants and sent millions of jobs overseas they added million people to the countrys population through legal and illegal immigration they papered over unemployment by using funny money to hire million federal state and local workers making it appear like everyone was engaged in productive work they used funny money to give out unearned benefits to tens of million of people to minimize starvation until the day of reckoning the day of reckoning has arrived the year treasury bonds interest rate at is at record highs for recent years that means the crash and the nationwide food riots and the race wars will soon be upon us it was only zero interest rates that kept the ponzi scheme going this long the only exit path i see is for the us military to be asked to stop the food riots as soon as they begin to ravage the country and the junior officers in the military must respond by arresting bankers and seizing their assets to fund debt cancellation only debt cancellation will provide a painless way out of the coming financial collapse,0

with actual malice over a fraudulent college rape story rolling stone and its parent company wenner media were also found to have defamed eramo who is seeking million in damages but to a lesser extent than the writer herself rubin erdelys piece conveyed that eramo was indifferent and even callous towards the accuser jackie coakley in addition to discouraging her from reporting the crime and so continues coverage of the rape hoax of the decade the controversy which began with the publication of rubin erdelys story in centered on a now debunked fraternity gang rape alleged by fabulist coakley well before this weeks court decision rubin erdely admitted to not bothering to contact the male uva students accused of the act these young men via their phi kappa psi fraternity are suing separately for million a surprisingly low figure which makes eramos claim look comparatively astronomical sabrina rubin erdely far left arrives for court pictured on the right is the deputy managing editor of rolling stone sean woods instrumental in the bogus storys publication and who defended it later because of coakleys limited financial position and the respect even outed sexual assault frauds are given eramo is legally pursuing only rubin erdely rolling stone and wenner media for the million nevertheless eramos attempts to portray herself as a victim are troubling she was after all uvas goto college administrator for handling sexual violence cases a euphemism for the organizer of what are basically kangaroo courts aside from eramo uva president teresa sullivans actions were appalling giving basic credence to jackies allegations sullivan suspended all greek life activities at the university of virginia as publicity about the accusations grew this only increased the suffering of the falsely maligned fraternity members plus gave ammunition to the rape culture activists who ridiculously represent every young male on campus as a potential sexual abuser of women the true victims are the falsely accused young men not nicole eramo nicole eramo is a victim of the same system she helps to prop up and defend rape culture nicole eramo may have been defamed but she was also intricately involved in a uva system that does not afford young men even the most basic procedural rights whilst we should be happy that she did not rush into supporting jackie coakleys lies to the extent of trying to eschew police involvement we are still not dealing with either an admirable or upstanding individual after extensive research i am yet to find instances of eramo challenging the shameful treatment of college students accused of sexual assault whether in specific instances or more broadly she is neither a defender of these young men nor some kind of principled whistleblower the only positive thing that can be generally said of her is that she is somewhat less prone to typical kneejerk sjw reactions ie she did try to get jackie to talk to the police again jackie coakley has escaped any punishment stupid does not even begin to describe the man who decided to marry rape hoaxer jackie coakley thanks to chuck johnson and wwwgotnewscom for their work in outing coakley as a fabulist and sociopath jackie coakley is the sociopathic architect of this whole mess notwithstanding that rubin erdely and others would have gleefully found another poster girl from somewhere else in america the degree of malice and calculation in coakleys actions is the worst i have seen even the very terrible crystal mangum the black stripper who is now serving a long sentence for homicide not false rape allegations made her bogus accusations of racism and being gang raped much more opportunistically after duke lacrosse players declined her services as a stripper coakleys misdeeds however inhabit a world of their own because women like jackie coakley obsessed as they are with fantasy worlds and selfvictimization have next to no money to go after in defamation suits they need to be charged and prosecuted for crimes such as public mischief it obviously would be better if they were charged with making a false rape claim yet coakley had enough selfpreserving foresight to avoid talking to the police consequently the system usually gives next to no remedies for discouraging outright lies about rape to boot the washington post may have savaged rubin erdely and rolling stone but it still refuses to publish jackie coakleys full name despite all the evidence completely disproving the rape accusations if nicole eramo gets million the accused male uva students deserve billion attentionseeker emily renda she used jackie coakleys lies to promote an agenda not seek redress for a victim determination of damages in the nicole eramo case is yet to take place and the million claim may just have been posturing by her legal team a high watermark figure designed to secure a smaller but nonetheless very tidy sum at a minimum the accused uva students deserve times more than whatever eramo gets of course wenner medias coffers are nowhere near that big but the principle remains compared to the mauled reputations of the witchhunted fraternity members eramo suffered a slight pinprick from a broken system she has otherwise staked her career on supporting and expanding other villains in this saga also need to be held to account chief among them is emily renda a sociology major at uva who is now completing a law degree at uc berkeley a rape culture extremist she acted as the conduit between coakley and rubin erdely as chuck johnson and got news have already demonstrated rendas own rape survivor story has changed biased journalists such as anna merlan formerly of jezebel additionally promoted the uva hoax and were greatly upset when the gang rape was found not to have taken place so many supporting actors created this mess lets hope that the heavy legal blows against rubin erdely rolling stone and obliquely jackie coakleys lies continue with the uva fraternity defamation suit only significant financial and legal hardship not the pangs of conscience will stop sjws and their enablers from attempting to ruin the lives of innocent men read more

that this topic is the focus of a great deal of discussion is because its roots are deeply steeped in both cowardice and betrayal while our readership is well acquainted with the political and social implications of cuckservatism there is also a need to also discuss its behavioral roots to accomplish this task i used my social media accounts to examine connections of mine who displayed all of the classic red flags associated with cuckservatism i then searched for common traits that they possessed based on the nature of their rants or posts the three characteristics listed below represent key factors which in my opinion are necessary for any individual to transform from an otherwise normal person into a cuck if we can understand these factors this will enable us to develop a more comprehensive strategy for rendering them irrelevant apart from merely ignoring them political naiveté nothing screams political naivety more than voting for a last minute candidate who considers himself a conservative alternative to trump this factor represents the first step that one must take to become a cuckservative because it entails believing in a series of premises that are patently false political naiveté can include simpler forms such as believing in the wage gap or that illegal immigrants are natural republicans conversely political naiveté can also be more complex in that an individual afflicted with it might believe in equality as a virtue or that a democratic two party system is the best form of government a perfect example of this can be seen in my friends and associates who blindly believe in the constitution these individuals refuse to vote for anyone other than a constitutionalist and their sole metric for judging candidates is the implications of an obscure constitutional issue that only they care about this perspective is indicative of political naiveé because the globalists who run our political system jettisoned any belief in the constitution and rule of law decades ago for them the constitution is merely a convenient rubber stamp used to justify unpopular political decisions accordingly anyone who votes only for candidates with such narrow viewpoints is naively playing into the hands of globalists because they fail to understand that the constitution will only function in a nation thats virtuous and willing to abide by its principles if the united states continues on its current demographic track we will eventually import a new population that not only despises original american values but would also actively vote to eliminate them the constitution will provide no protections if this occurs because these people will simply ignore it invoking arguably the most important phrase in all of american legal history to fail to understand these stakes when considering ones voting patterns instead opting to emulate the local revolutionary war reenactors is a hallmark trait of a cuckservative lack of self confidence a cuckservative would never get this far lack of selfconfidence and the feelings of doubt that serve as its foundation represents a second symptom of cuckservatism which is why return of kings has countless articles on how to acquire and maintain selfconfidence as a form of preventative medicine doubts as to ones chances of success coupled with fear and the innate need for selfpreservation can easily shatter most people in such moments of weakness its very easy for a person to do a and to do something that they would normally find revolting conversely if one steadfastly believes in their convictions and themselves their selfconfidence will become stronger this is true even in situations when seemingly the entire world is against them the following clip is from an interview that jeb bush did with lester holt during the republican primary and is an excellent illustration of how a lack of selfconfidence can lead to powerlessness and a lack of control over ones surroundings from the very beginning of this clip jebs lack of self confidence is readily apparent whether it was the fact that he was too far hunched over in his seat his attempts to curb his nervousness by forcing himself to smile or laugh or the fact that he rarely made eye contact with lester holt any ability that he has to project himself was undermined by his body language an even deeper sign of his lack of selfconfidence begins at in the video when holt proceeds to ask him why he didnt frame the charleston shooting as an act of racism in this situation if asked such a question in any setting an individual has one of two choices if he is selfconfident he would turn the question back on lester holt by saying that racism is a social construct and the only people who care about it are limpwristed losers however if one is like jeb and lacks selfconfidence their response to this situation will be to immediately try to compromise by acknowledging the premise raised by someone like lester holt and then spend the rest of the interview trying to show that theyre not a bad person this was the approach that jeb used and it demonstrated to lester holt that he was weak which then led to lester forcing jeb to backtrack and question his own decision to support stand your ground laws during his tenure as floridas governor a lack of selfconfidence as evidenced by jebs failure to retain control over his surroundings during his interview with lester holt highlights a classic character trait shared by cuckservatives the only answer that i can come up with as to why this trait is so prevalent is that it might be a product of their childhood that they havent been able to get over in a way the archetypal cuck was likely bullied or mistreated as a child but has never learned how to fight back or to love being hated by others because of this they never developed the necessary level of selfconfidence to succeed in life which eventually translates over to their politics they want to be friends with everyone how to destroy a political movement established by ones father in one fell swoop having grown up in the leftist northeast and considering that i still live and work there im used to being in the political minority my coping mechanisms for this situation consisted of unknowingly embracing key tenets of the alternative right and knowing how to pick my political fights additionally i also resolved to never be friendly with or ever trust anyone from the political left a decision that has been vindicated over the last several years unfortunately my approach is not a popular one amongst political dissidents in my region this is because many of them having grown up with leftists simply view their political disagreements as a series of gentlemanly differences that they can put aside over a few beers they refuse to believe that leftists and sjws hate anyone who even slightly disagrees with them and like women view weak men as easy targets accordingly when faced with the choice of staying true to their beliefs or moderating them in order to ensure that they get invited to the next sushi night art showing or paint nite the cuckservatives that i know will roll over every time specifically theyll profess support for third party libertarian or constitutional candidates while supporting a slightly lessliberal version of their leftist friends politics this tendency demonstrates a key principle that most cuckservatives subconsciously hold they want to be liked by everyone and will therefore do anything they can to make this happen even if it means betraying themselves and their own beliefs in the process when does adopting this attitude ever lead to success in life if a child keeps getting beat up by a schoolyard bully should they cower in the bullys presence and act as his lackey in order to avoid getting hurt we all know that such an approach is worthless and that the only way to respond is to fight back yet these people adopt the same approach when dealing with the political equivalent of a schoolyard bully perhaps their reason for trying to be friends with globalists and trying to appease them by being moderate stems from the way in which they handled problems in childhood however that issue itself is another topic that deserves discussion by itself is there a remedy for these character flaws even if we understand these characteristics and can think of active ways to subvert cuckservatism we will not be entirely successful most people who fall under this category have been psychologically conditioned to act this way meaning that much of our attempts to open their eyes will fall on deaf ears i have no sympathy for these people because theyve never had the internal drive or fortitude necessary to overcome adversity and would rather wallow in misery while also pulling others into the abyss with them however there are always a couple that might show potential these individuals might only be seen by us as cuckservatives because they imitated others around them while lacking a positive role model that could show them the truth the greatest service we can do for these select few is to identify them and prove that there is a viable alternative if cents a day can supposedly help a starving african family have rice for six months then us acting as positive role models to our weaker brethren will help them immeasurably while also advancing our own cause read more david frenchs candidacy for president shows that cuckservatives cant stop donald trump,0

my mother never found a living wage job and relied on my fathers public sector union position to meet our familys needs in the st century obama expanded bushs war on terror which merged my fathers job

then my sister and i graduated with large sums of student debt i have worked four jobs in three years and only one has paid a truly living wage another four years of a democratic party president was not going to make anything better for my family that is not to say that donald trump was the answer to the structural problems of exploitation but trumps victory is not the end of the world either trumps victory is the product of global capitalisms decay millions of people voted for trump for a variety of reasons namely because he clearly labeled problems and outlined solutions to them i dont agree with all of his solutions white nationalism stains his domestic and international agenda trumps call to further militarize the usmexico border yet make peace with russia is a contradiction in and of itself a white nationalist billionaire who speaks the language of racism on the one hand and the interests of peace on the other is not exactly a model of consistency however trumps consistency is not the most important aspect of this election millions of people have shown their disgust with the twoparty system of the capitalist class a number of mostly white workers and whites from the petty business class voted for trump trump also received more votes than expected from the black and latino electorate meanwhile the elections produced a low turnout for clinton from the historic democratic party bases of black voters latino voters and women voters clinton may have won the electoral vote but the balance of forces ensured the ruling class would gamble on trump trumps base of white workers and petty business elites angered by thirty years of monopoly capitalist assault are more of a threat at the moment than the millions of democratic party voters who are now without a home the round table of elites called the electoral college could not afford any more damage to the democratic party than what transpired during the election so the democratic party is now on its deathbed and there is only one class of people willing to resurrect it white liberals a large section of the democratic party base wanted bernie sanders to be their next president they did not hold their nose for clinton the legitimate concerns that immigrants and oppressed people possess with trumps racism should not be led into the bowels of the democratic party yet for white liberals this is the ultimate mission more brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it trumps sexual predator characteristics his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired the significance of the gops attempted purge of donald trump trumps victory has energized the white liberal section of the united states to fight back white liberals began the process in a deep state of mourning over clintons loss they then placed blame for trumps victory on russia lowvoter turnout and the white working class white liberals have blamed everyone except hillary clinton and the democratic party now white liberals in the us hope to wage a crusade against trump in hopes of a democratic party recovery it is all too clear that their primary intention is to get ahead of the genuine forces that rejected both trump and clinton and lead them into the democratic party graveyard white liberals love to hide their own racism and ruling class sensibilities through a process of appeal and betrayal they speak with the authority of moral righteousness on the one hand and the knife of oppression on the other they talk down to the struggle of peoples oppressed by white supremacy and attempt to steer it in a way that benefits their class interests white liberals despise the working class because they understand that there will come a day when it destroys the system that they profit so handsomely from white liberals usually originate from the ruling class the managerial class and various stripes of the professionalized sector their class has ordained themselves the true leaders of human rights based on race gender and sexual equality however white liberals speak of human rights on the basis of a complete abandonment of the material struggle for liberation in other words the white liberal is the ultimate counterrevolutionary force in us society it has wielded the socalled struggle for human rights as a weapon to prevent the emergence of classconsciousness among the oppressed and its genuine leaders the elections have shown that the broad class arrangement of white liberals is indeed in crisis and only has itself to blame white liberals cannot acknowledge that it was their brand of politics that led to the trump moment their dominance over the left in the us ensured that no organized force existed strong enough to challenge the ills of capitalist decline millions of people voted for sanders based on his demands for material relief millions of people voted for trump for the similar reasons his racism and sexism notwithstanding whatever racism and sexism existed in his rhetoric could not trump the fact that the trade deals and wars he spoke out against in part drove ordinary people to vote for him if the trump base wanted racism and sexism primarily they would of voted for ted cruz or jeb bush in the primaries so white liberal anger about trumps victory is not directed at sexism racism or any other aspect of trumps politics white liberals are afraid of the sharpening contradictions of us society that threaten to squeeze them out of their privileged position under the racist and capitalist order millions of people are now asking where white liberalism was during the massive loss in working class income and wealth that occurred over the last forty years where were the white liberals during the endless wars that have been waged even more fervently by democratic party administrations where were the white liberals during the erection of the largest police and prison state in the world the institutions that murder and incarcerate black americans in record numbers and deport undocumented peoples at historic rates the answer is that white liberals were supporting the us capitalist systems assault on the oppressed every step of the way this is what they are trying to hide with their anger over trump we cannot defeat trumps white nationalism if the white liberal is not defeated with just as much vigor white liberal ideology has a history of infecting social movements as it spreads it breeds the germs of democratic party control over these movements but the democratic party made its own bed by acting as the more effective evil of the ruling class if a powerful movement of the working class is to emerge in the age of trump then we must fight hard against the white liberal forces working hard to resuscitate the democratic party and build an independent party of our own,0

direction a posthuman one transcript with references and additional av material undoubtedly there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when hillary clinton lost presidential elections to donald trump if for nothing else then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears because racism homophobia xenophobia and whateverphobia it was a joy and a relief because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism dubbed political correctness to be a paper tiger however party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance as sjw s are hopefully moving out from the spotlight of posthistorical stage the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image if we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn this image will be just as ugly and just as unreal as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct shitlib in the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the alternative right movement richard spencer in the future we are to deal with the leadership of children of the sun this is an interesting and to my mind quite worrisome statement of intent a manifestation of will as spencer would doubtless rectify me pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal and quite unidirectional circular movement of the pagan deity revered by all selfrespecting übermenschen from nietzsche to postmodern occultists however theres a deeper astrotheological metaphor at work here the pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy nietzsche in its virtual postmodern installment is not to be strictly represented by swastika as spencer apparently assumes but by other only seemingly ancient symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and pc gaming and turned into ideological brand by russian philosopher alexander dugin or his minions an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement the symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement not of sun but of presumably primordial origin of everything chaos in the lines to follow well provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation the channeling of chaos principle and adjacent chaos logic through loosely knit alt right movement taking as a starting point some statements from spencers speech held at npi conference in washington dc on november st triumph of the will or hipster babylon working in introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right embodied in the election of donald trump spencer makes one interesting remark but even though we always took trump seriously there was still a moment of unreality or perhaps too painfully intense reality when the state of pennsylvania was called for donald trump the moment when we knew kek had smiled upon us that meme magic was real and though these terms are used halfjokingly they represent something truly importantthe victory of will we willed donald trump into office made this dream into reality it is all delivered in a manner of an injoke not to be taken too seriously moreover to the uninitiated into mysteries of this internet movement it is probably unclear who is kek and what exactly is meme magic well start our explanation with lesser weirdness meme is an expression denoting inexistent existent coined apparently by richard dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology memes are thoughts expressed in image andor phrase which by circulation in public acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to infect the consciousness with their messages like viruses meme is inexistent because theres no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based selfsubsistence and ability to procreate like viruses images andor phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial yet they quite paradoxically exist because analogy apparently works however no one seems to pose the question why it works well it works because it is magical chaos magick here we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern in fact posthumanist vein resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can and should be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution if artificial construct is in line with principle of evolution it is real or to be more precise it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle it is imagined into existence therefore meme magick works only insofar it relies upon artificial preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with memes as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs the goal of practitioner of such magic a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic is to change the world according to his will this is more or less what is known from the seventies of the last century as chaos magick a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in subhuman and subnatural domain of the world in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it the peculiarity of chaos magick is on the one hand that it is entirely syncretic ie that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe with intended subjective meaning and that it relies on virtual ie artificial world of mass culture now embodied above all in internet the idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible there are many interesting implications to this the first is that everything is interrelated ie that everything is connected with everything else so any which way you take youll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough the second is that theres no hierarchy of higher and lower theres only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements dissolving in turn into nothingness if concentrated upon as theres nothing higher theres nothing to be revered and everything can and indeed should be an object of ironical laughter and most importantly this is the world of dreams ruled by what is usually called dream logic but in actual fact chaos logic or unlogic in this sense richard spencer quite accurately proclaimed trumps victory an accomplishment of meme or chaos magick trump is willed into office by internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality virtual reality one may add yet reality nonetheless the fact that trump was elected for a plethora of motives from the appeal of his politics to public takedown of hillary clinton by wikileaks is immaterial because in the world of chaos every subjective reality tunnel or interpretation of the world is as real as any other in this sense we can observe new god emperor of usa as a magical creation of internet by the internet and for the internet today still the internet of interconnected computer nodes but soon probably the internet of things if one is to push spencers remark to its logical extreme we can assert that illustrious donald is the worlds first president of posthuman race an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra antiprogressive group so that was lesser weirdness let us proceed now to high weirdness we owe the reader an answer to a question who the hell is kek well the reason why spencer mentions him is again a magickal halfjoke kek is interpreted to be an ancient egyptian deity by a number of internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar pepe the frog while i habitually suspend judgment on all things egyptian because ancient egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts i consider this interpretation upon closer inspection to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic namely pepe the cartoon character conceived in by cartoonist matt furie emerged as a meme from the depths of internet forums more precisely chan subforum pol devoted to political discussions with no holds barred which was in view of some observers a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados a place of absolute freedom therefore absolute chaos the expression kek was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the injoke among the players of world of warcraft replacing the standard internet abbreviation lol laughing out loud someone eventually noticed that kek is in fact the name of frogheaded egyptian deity signifying chaos and darkness and pepe was rebranded as kek the deity ironic one no doubt half joking one as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it but deity nonetheless it is important to point out that in view of the most esoteric kekists that is half grinning faithful of kekpepe the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities causally unrelated meaningful relations among events so it came to pass that kek sounds very similar to cuckoriginally cuckservative a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not red pilled another meme taken from pop culture shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists by alt right or should we assume kek himself furthermore hillary clinton addressed pepe as nothing less than public enemy identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character then it happened that after this act hillary fainted in front of the cameras and that was immediately interpreted as an action of kek a good rundown of kekpepetrump identification however it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on pol subforum one last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture dubs every post on chan and similar venues comes with an digit numerical stamp this number represents that posts entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard with the amount of traffic these sites get the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll when a poster gets repeated digits its called dubs trips quads and so on since a poster cant know their post number until after theyve submitted the post its common for people to bet the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits when that endeavor proves a successful a get has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated out of this practice a strange phenomenon began to take place on pol discussion threads associated with trump displayed noticeably frequent gets it wasnt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture pepe the frog now pols unofficial mascot donald trump pols overwhelming candidate of choice repeating digit post numbers gets kek used as an expression of delight particular in response to trumps trolling of the establishment as well as in reaction to unlikely gets in general and a god was born source synchronicities related to emergence of kek the god and his merging with trump in the bowels of internet forums early on in the presidential campaign are so numerous and frankly mind boggling that we cannot list them here for the sake of brevity for our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados including core leadership kek is the god and trump is his prophet all declared with smug grin and ironical stance yet with all the necessary power of conviction namely chaos magick relies on laughter or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially unprincipled fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its practitioner to impose his own will and change the world as spencer would put it make his dreams a reality i would go further and add make all reality a dream because chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual ie posthuman world the idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism in its essence however it is a complete opposite a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of being into nothingness of primordial chaos posthuman traditionalism i already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of alexander dugin who is probably the most consequent subverter of tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age but now we can see how his affiliates in usa and europe are doing the same thing with less philosophical subtlety but fueled by much greater raw power namely alt right if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition something richard spencer likes to call political theology founded on new age filtered aryan myths racial interpretation of nietzsche and generally crossbred with do your own thing mentality all done in the virtual ether of information technology after all if we are to agree with spencer half jokingly of course that god emperor was inaugurated by the act of kek the god then the victory of alt right traditionalists is in fact the victory of technological magic the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand ray kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics in the end therefore we are talking about another victory of posthumanism branded spontaneously or otherwise as traditionalism the obsession of alt right adherents with identity in general and white identity in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of tradition they supposedly defend they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted observing the plethora of various rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard from macho gay postmodern spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic and to a large extent made up pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator save maybe for quite unchallenged neodarwinist stance especially to be found among game bloggers as chateau heartiste if someone thinks that he can reattach himself to premodern spiritual history of humankind actually the only one there is while at the same time musing about alpha and beta males sexual market signaling and countersignaling professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental gmo of memes genes and biological analogies he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends the allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the west induced by process of globalization yet this is an eristic or to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine discordian dialectic the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of chaos it is all done with the crooked half grin a pinch of salt to every smug remark with irony of the man who knows hes a liar and a cheat but smug humor goes just a short way in the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend far more effectively than dead serious pc brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for well end with the word of warning to christian adherents of alt right the words have a definite meanings and power theres only one chaos and theres only one bringer of light from chaos as some kek worshipers already defined the poor frogs main job and its not the one to be defined as god from god light from light but god from gutter light from darkness a real darkness shining in virtual brightness hope you guess his name so without a pinch of irony i declare be careful who your hail author branko mali is a croatian author and owner of kali tribune with the background in classical philosophy hes focused on philosophy media culture and deep politics analysis,0

and nonlethal weaponry pepper spray mace a number of atvs five tanks two helicopters and militaryequipped humvees showed up to tear down an encampment of standing rock sioux water protectors and supporters armed with nothing under orders from the nownotorious morton county sheriffs office this ridiculously heavyhanded standing army came better prepared to do battle than some actual military units fighting overseas but the target of their operation a group of slightly more than native american water protectors and supporters opposing construction of the dakota access pipeline never intended to do battle with the armed taxpayerfunded corporatebacked statesponsored aggressors reports vary but no less than people were arrested thursday and according to witnesses police marked numbers on arrestees arms and housed them in cementfloored dog kennels without any padding before they were transported as far away as fargo it goes back to concentration camp days asserted ocetisakowin coordinator mekasi camphorinek who along with his mother was marked and detained in a mesh kennel reports the los angeles times although thursdays incident remained relatively peaceful for some time with only shouts chants and occasional attempts by water protectors to convince this standing army to examine its motives and reconsider clashes nonetheless broke out solely because of gratuitous police aggression after facing off for a couple hours these militant cops began closing in on the water protectors to shut down the treaty of camp in reference to the fort laramie treaty of that year which established a large parcel of land designated exclusively native american territory not to be disturbed by the us government prior to his arrest camphorinek had established the camp stating as cited by indigenous rising today the oceti sakowin has enacted eminent domain on dapl lands claiming treaty rights this is unceded land highway as of this point is blockaded we will be occupying this land and staying here until this pipeline is permanently stopped we need bodies and we need people who are trained in nonviolent direct action we are still staying nonviolent and we are still staying peaceful despite the water protectors commitment to nonviolence the militarized police response went as would be expected horribly awry a prayer circle of elders including several women was interrupted and all were arrested for standing peacefully on the public road stated a press release from indigenous environment network a tipi was erected in the road and was recklessly dismantled despite law enforcement statements that they would merely mark the tipi with a yellow ribbon and ask its owners to retrieve it a group of water protectors was also dragged out of a sweat lodge ceremony erected in the path of the pipeline thrown to the ground and arrested claims to the contrary by morton county sheriff kyle kirchmeier aside native american and indigenous water protectors and supporters have refrained from violent acts on the whole preferring instead peaceful prayer vigils and acts of civil disobedience no matter how peacefully the opposition acts armed defenders of big oil interests seem determined to brutalize disrespect and generally incite and inflict violence against those who desire unsullied water for generations to come in fact at the beginning of september a private security firm hired by energy transfer partners the company responsible for pipeline construction indiscriminately unleashed vicious attack dogs on water protectors press and supporters for reasons as yet unknown during the savage attack a pregnant woman young girl and many others suffered serious dog bites thanks to the ineptitude of the dogs handlers afterward a warrant for inciting a riot was issued democracy now journalist amy goodman for doing her job filming events as they happened though charges were subsequently thrown out although etp and some law enforcement officers defended the barbarous actions of the private security mercenaries the guardian now reports that because the guards lacked proper licensing they could now face criminal charges on wednesday the morton county sheriffs office made the determination that dog handlers were not properly licensed to do security work in the state of north dakota bob frost owner of ohiobased frost kennels told the guardian all the proper protocols were already done i pulled my guys out the next day because we werent there to go to war with these protesters frost insisted he had cooperated with authorities investigating the incident but the sheriffs department disagrees seven handlers and dogs were deployed to the scene in early september allegedly in response to reports of trespassers but according to the guardian police have only managed to identify two people the sheriffs department claims frost has not provided necessary information and unnamed security officials cited in the report said that there were no intentions of using the dogs or handlers for security work however because of the protest events the dogs were deployed as a method of trying to keep the protesters under control in a statement cited by the guardian morton county captain jay gruebele said although lists of security employees have been provided there is no way of confirming whether the list is accurate or if names have been purposely withheld water protectors in the meantime are left to deal with absurdly disproportionate state violence and the altogether unacceptable disrespectful and demeaning insult of being relegated to dog kennels after being arrested for exercising their rights as lakota country times editor brandon ecoffey wrote in an editorial thursday over the course of the last several months the abuse of detainees by morton county law enforcement has overstepped every boundary guaranteed by the american constitution water protectors have been seen being bound and hooded by police people are being stripped searched and abused within their jail for misdemeanor crimes and police have employed the use of mass surveillance through drones on the protector camps this isnt a war zone this is north

amount of damage that has been done to the us economy over the past eight years in this article i am going to share some economic numbers with you that are extremely sobering anyone that takes a cold hard honest look at the numbers should be able to see that our economy is in terrible shape unfortunately the way that we see things is often clouded by our political views up until the election democrats were far more likely then republicans to believe that the economy was improving but now that is in the process of completely reversing according to gallup only percent of republicans believed that the economy was getting better before the election but that number has suddenly jumped to percent after trumps election victory and the percentage of democrats that believe that the economy is getting better fell from percent to percent after the election here are some additional details from gallup after trump won last weeks election republicans and republicanleaning independents now have a much more optimistic view of the us economys outlook than they did just of republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election while said it was getting worse since the election say it is getting better and worse conversely democrats and democraticleaning independents confidence in the economy plummeted after the election before the election of democrats said the economy was getting better and worse now democrats are evenly divided with saying it is getting better and saying it is getting worse the truth of course is that the result of the election did not somehow magically alter the outlook for the us economy we still have a giant mess on our hands and the following are very depressing economic realities that donald trump will inherit from barack obama nearly out of every americans have less than in savings that means that about twothirds of the country is essentially living paycheck to paycheck at this moment reuters is reporting that us mall investors are poised to lose billions of dollars as the retail apocalypse in this nation deepens credit card delinquencies have hit the highest level that we have seen since approximately percent of all americans have a debt that is at least days past due the rate of homeownership has fallen for eight years in a row and is now hovering near a year low the total number of government employees now outnumbers the total number of manufacturing employees in this country by almost million the number of homeless people in new york city where donald trump is from has hit a brand new record high about percent of all young adults are currently living with their parents total household debt in the united states has now reached a grand total of trillion dollars the total amount of corporate debt in the us has nearly doubled since the end of when barack obama entered the white house the us government was trillion dollars in debt today the us national debt is currently sitting at a staggering total of despite nearly doubling the national debt during his eight years in the white house barack obama is going to be the only president in united states history to never have a single year when us gdp grew by at least three percent so will donald trump waltz in and suddenly turn everything around just like when george w bush was elected there is a lot of optimism about the future right now among republicans and in republicans are going to have control of the senate and the house in addition to being in control of the white house but does that mean that they will actually get anything done for a moment lets review what didnt happen the last time the republicans were in this position the following is an extended excerpt from an article by author devvy kidd the republicans had control of both houses of congress part of the time during bush jrs two terms did they lock down our borders no did they pass legislation to stop all funding for illegals which would selfdeport millions of liars cheats and thieves no read please how to selfdeport millions of illegals did they stop trillions in unconstitutional spending no did they get rid of any of clintons unconstitutional executive orders one or two but otherwise let comrade bill clinton crap in our faces did they get rid of one unconstitutional cabinet like hhs department of education and epa no did they stop the unconstitutional foreign aid no did they stop unconstitutional spending for planned parenthood no congress just continues to use borrowed money to spend more debt did they stop unconstitutional spending for the gigantic hoax called global warming or climate change no trump the left just lost the war on climate change did bush jr get us out of all the destructive trade treaties killing american jobs no did they crack down on visas bringing in tens of thousands of foreign workers when american workers who want to work are left in the unemployment line no did they stop more and more federal regulations strangling americas businesses no did they impeach one single activist judge destroying our freedom and liberty no a republican controlled congress with a republican in the white house and they did virtually nothing to restore america to a constitutional republic and constitutional spending so will things be any different under a trump administration we shall see there will be tremendous pressure to maintain the status quo in many instances because the process of fixing things would undoubtedly make conditions worse in the shortterm a great example of this is the national debt as i discussed yesterday the only reason why we are able to enjoy such a massively inflated standard of living in this country federal government started spending only the money that it brought in through taxes our ridiculous debt would begin collapsing immediately we consume far more wealth than we produce and the only way that we are able to do this is by borrowing insane amounts of money either donald trump will continue to borrow money recklessly or we will go into a major league economic downturn it really is that simple but when our politicians borrow money they are literally destroying the future of this country so the choice is pain in the shortterm or greater pain in the longterm there is a way out and that would involve shutting down the federal reserve and going to a completely debtfree form of money but that is a topic for another article and unfortunately that is not something that is even on donald trumps radar at this point no matter who won the election the next president was going to be faced with some very harsh economic realities there are many out there that have faith that donald trump can pull off an unprecedented economic miracle but there are others that are deeply skeptical let us hope for the best but let us also keep preparing for the worst,1

carolina the following is an opinion column by r muse some americans are likely aware of the psychological term projecting that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else as an unconscious form of transferring guilt for ones own actions as soon as the republican primaries concluded donald trump projected republicans guilt for election rigging either through vote obstruction or suppression onto democrats and his opponent hillary clinton republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of barack obama in and they have only ramped up their election rigging activities over the past eight years and yet trump accuses democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath yesterday the north carolina conference of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp filed a lawsuit against north carolina republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the coordinated effort to suppress the black vote in the state what the naacp rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in the state the election rigging amounts to three counties in north carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of mostly african american democratic residents a week before the presidential election the lawsuit charged election officials in beaufort moore and cumberland counties of denying primarily african american voters eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were bounced back as undeliverable most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging such as james edward arthur sr had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots many of the purged voters lived at their original registration address and were victims of a simple postal service error mr arthur is an african american who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue arthur testified that he like thousands of other african american democratic voters never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied or that if he didnt attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy mr arthur said if i knew my right to vote was in jeopardy i would do whatever i could to protect it i want and plan to vote in the upcoming election but i am concerned that since my registration has been canceled i will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted it is what any sane human being would consider election rigging simply because the tricounty ploy targeted primarily african americans who typically vote for democrats it is also something north carolina republicans have been guilty of for the past six years according to the naacp lawsuit north carolina republicans are in violation of the national voter registration act which bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final days before an election republican election officials state officials defended their election rigging and said they were justified in purging tensofthousands of mainly african american democratic voters eligibility the definition of systemic on an individual basis however the naacp also accused republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly african american voters eligibility who did not receive the mailing one republican who ran for a local office last year shane hubers challenged the registration of voters the majority who are them democrats in beaufort county in one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit cumberland county one individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of mostly democratic voters in moore county the secretary of the local republican party n carol wheeldon challenged approximately mainly african american registered voters likely because they do not vote for republicans the lead attorney for the naacps lawsuit penda hair said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted republican election rigging conspiracy we know that in two of the counties the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local republican party we also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties ms hair also noted that in moore county the return address of a rightwing group called the voter integrity project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters this is a very pernicious treatment of voters she said it is also a deliberate act of election rigging by republicans the president of the north carolina naacp reverend dr william barber said we are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in north carolina that weve seen since the days of jim crow the tar heel state is ground zero in the intentional surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters these attempts are a direct affront to our constitution the naacp lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since using this election rigging process back on the rolls immediately the organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on election day they have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case it might be the case that the naacps request for a hearing may be granted especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that north carolina republicans violated the national voter registration act in yet another manner failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a dmv office over the past few years last thursday us district court judge loretta biggs ordered north carolina republicans to permit those tensofthousands of voters to cast provisional ballots it is highly doubtful that north carolina republicans will obey the federal judges orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their election rigging actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the american people first elected barack obama as president and the conservatives on the supreme court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with republicans to suppress or obstruct the voting rights of primarily people of color because they dont support republicans to be perfectly clear it is irrelevant if it is called voter suppression obstruction or disenfranchisement it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections and it is only republicans and the koch brothers outfit the american legislative exchange council alec who are behind each and every attempt in republicancontrolled states to kill democracy by doing what the republican party standard bearer donald trump is guilty of projecting rig

cascaded across the nation for the third day following the presidential election result mainstream media outlets like cnn and msnbc have given the protests aroundtheclock media coverage drowning out all other news stories including a successful transition meeting between the president elect and president barack obama outsider vs insider manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of trump presidency photo illustration wires shawn helton the free thought project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated antitrump protests organized in part by by the george soros ngo moveon washington dc billionaire globalist financier george soros moveonorg has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of donald trump exposing the protests to largely be an organized topdown operation and not an organic movement of concerned americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least major us cities chicago new york los angeles philadelphia boston washington dc portland ore st paul minn seattle and several other cities saw protests according to usa today in light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of trump a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether its an organic grassroots movement or something much more organized sophisticated and potentially dangerous soros affiliated organization moveonorg released the following press release yesterday afternoon americans to come together in hundreds peaceful gatherings of solidarity resistance and resolve following election results hundreds of americans dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the white house and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny racism islamophobia and xenophobia tonight thousands of americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation including outside the white house following the results of tuesdays presidential election the gatherings organized by moveonorg and allies will affirm a continued rejection of donald trumps bigotry xenophobia islamophobia and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the america we still believe is possible within two hours of the calltoaction moveon members had created more than gatherings nationwide with the number continuing to grow on wednesday afternoon soros agitprop empire last year during the ongoing european migrant crisis startling claims were levied by hungarian pm victor orban left photo concerning the role played by soros pm orban contended that the founder and chair of open society foundations open society institute was entrenched in a circle of activists that inadvertently become part of this international humansmuggling network the stunning declaration by orban recalled the misguided machinations of the occupy movement aka ows in as well as the soros funded protests in ferguson missouri in along with other black lives matter protests this past year all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants along with paid provocateurs into violent action and social unrest back in january moveon publicly endorsed the bernie sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for blm associated groups seen backing sanders its worth mentioning that moveon also supported the obama campaign in and according to the website sanders was the only other candidate to reach the threshold for an endorsement as we said back in march professional political agitator flash mobs had been mobilized at future trump campaign events making it very difficult to run a normal campaign as activists attempted to take away trumps strength in numbers at his rallies this was confirmed at events in both ohio and at a trump primary campaign event the university of illinois chicago earlier this year where hundreds of blm activists and sanders supporters triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage shortly after trump started speaking then again at reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort trump away in a politico article in early entitled major donors consider funding black lives matter we gained deeper insight into the political funding for blm and the soros linked democratic alliance major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression said steve phillips a democracy alliance member and significant contributor to democratic candidates and causes he donated to a st louis nonprofit group called the organization for black struggle that helped organize black lives matterrelated protests in ferguson missouri over the police killing of a black teenager named michael brown and phillips and his wife democracy alliance board member susan sandler are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement it worth noting how soros a long time contributor to hillary clinton donated million in pac money in and january of soros reportedly gave million to boost clintons campaign soros also recently funded million to latino groups looking to stop trumps rise towards a potential gop nomination and beyond look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances social engineering political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media ngos and social media image source abc news during the last month it was revealed how investigative nonprofit project veritas found evidence that the dnc paid participants to incite violence at trump rallies during the course of the election if those reports are accurate reports which have gone unchallenged so far this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also us criminal law paid protest social justice warriors incite antitrump violence across the us image source youtube usa color revolutions both the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare these political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions ultimately a radical globalist and cultural marxist progressive agenda is at play eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial color upheavals and where possible weakening a countrys national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the un or imf while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the publics political perspective this is how the us and its cia conduct their destablization color revolution campaigns overseas and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the us overseas washington tends to use the same cast of ngo fronts to buildup prous political opposition groups as well as plan and generate civil unrest they include the albert einstein institute aei national endowment for democracy ned international republican institute iri national democratic institute ndi freedom house and later the international center for nonviolent conflict icnc and the us agency for international development usaid the financial and contractor arm of the department of state inside the us deep state actors in washington generally work through democratic party affiliated organizations like moveonorg as well as through labor union organizations like aflcio and unite here these along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests it still remains to be seen if trumps stated dynamic political vision for america can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world in addition to helping economic woes at home or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism this remains to be seen certainly judging by president obama and hillary clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots the political motivation is undeniable to help delegitimize a new trump presidency but one thing is for sure theres no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the th president and the public should question why legal action against soros groups in a recent report featured at rt news we learn that george soros and blm activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in dallas and baton rouge the father of the dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a black lives matter protest is suing the organizations activists and george soros for million in a separate suit a baton rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a blm protest the father of patrick zamarripa filed a lawsuit against black lives matter and other groups for allegedly inciting a war on police that led to the death of his son the lawsuit filed in us district court in dallas on monday seeks million in damages while defendant black lives matter claims to combat antiblack racism the lawsuit said according to the fort worth star telegram the movement has in fact incited and committed further violence severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities jews and caucasians defendant black lives matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang the misguided machinations behind the antitrump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the presidentelect will these protest groups be a reboot of the ows movement occupying the masses with their own hateful rhetoric as we move into and beyond more from the duran below neo black bloc black bloc provocateurs have violently escalated protest movements since the s all the way through s occupy wall street

do with charity or justice and everything to do with political leverage and in extreme cases government insurrection we have seen soros begin destructive movements to remove those he deems unsuitable to govern in a variety of countries most recently in ukraine with the soros sponsored maidan coup now it looks like soros may be setting his sights on sabotaging the forthcoming trump presidency we do know thanks to wikileaks that george soros was a huge supporter of hillary clinton as hillary clinton was always looking out of george soros best interests we are certain trumps victory is a bitter

all black womens lives whether cisgender transgender or genderqueer in addition to rejecting eurocentric beauty standards that are made to lessen the beauty of black women and black womens features being antisexist also means realizing that police brutality the prison industrial system school to prison pipeline and the like are aspects of structural racism that affect black women as much as they impact black men black liberation entails queer liberation and trans liberation we also seek to destroy the heteronormative norms that dehumanize black queer people the blc asserts the homophobia within the black community comes by way of the same hands responsible for white supremacy presumably transphobia within the black community is also a legacy of white supremacy in cooperation with cissexism and the gender binary transphobia has been used as a means of invalidating and erasing our trans family members the blc pledges to eliminate such systemic biases these social justice warriors sjws are staunch opponents of the capitalist notions of infinite profit homogenized markets and a privatized means of production capitalism they insist is the economic system thats been used to justify the oppression marginalization and exploitation of blacks nor is the solution to this oppression to be found in supporting blackowned businesses the blc explains that we cannot adopt the patriarchal exploitative tools of our oppressors as we seek liberation rather the solution is to dismantle antiblack capitalist corporations that benefit from our oppression it isnt only the capitalist corporations that these students want destroyed they demand as well the eradication of all institutional practices and policies that discriminate against the black community and the removal of all federal state and local government officials who do not abide by our principles the state and all its institutions that deny black humanity and black agency must be dismantled and replaced with those that produce black liberty concerning its attitude toward america the blc is clear this country was built to systematically oppress groups of people and the black liberation collective will not stand for it haidt misspeaks in characterizing as the year when the university experienced a crisis of identity an unmanageable conflict of goals to judge from the vast majority of liberal arts humanities and social sciences departments social justice long ago eclipsed truth as the raison detre of the academy interestingly it is these sjw demands from last year that bear this out perhaps it is because ive spent the last couple of decades in the academy in the capacity of both student and faculty that i may be more privy to this than are some others but its painfully obvious that these student activists did not come up with these demands on their own if they didnt have their professors actually write the demands for them then the black liberation collective unquestionably derived the concepts and language of their statement of demands from their mentors to put it bluntly one must attend college major in the liberal arts and humanities and study under far left professors in order to think in the terms that are characteristic of social justice warriors leftist ideologues are training their students to bend the university to their will this is the first point there is though another a rich irony that is lost upon these selfstyled radicals for all of their bluster over systemic racism and structural white supremacy ie phenomena that are omnipresent and hence largely unconscious these black students their white collaborators and their professors fail to realize that their thinking for lack of a better term on these issues is about as eurocentric as one can get the critical race theory to which the blc subscribe is a version of marxism the philosophical vision of a th century germanjewish man the marxist tradition within which they are enmeshed was fleshed out over a span of generations by mostly white heterosexual men but theres more to it than this the idea that racism sexism homophobia transphobia ableism and the like against which sjws rail are evils to be defeated is itself peculiar to the moral traditions of european civilization if these isms and phobias are immoral it can only be because those who are guilty of them fail to judge the individual as an individual color gender sexual orientation ability and so forth are neither constitutive of nor essential to the moral identity of the individualbut only if the framework of the doctrine of individualism is accepted yet this conception of the sacrosanct individual is as eurocentric as the proverbial apple pie is american the social justice warriors intellectual landscape is as much a european colony as was any west african country in the th or early th centuries those in the black liberation collective have most definitely internalized the modes of thought of their oppressor now they would have been well aware of all this had they received a genuine education in college rather than a training in social justice,1

unrelated case additional classified material may have been mishandled on clintons personal email server cnbc reported the latest fbi developments including a passage from comeys letter discussing the new investigation in previous congressional testimony i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation fbi had completed its investigation of former secretary clintons personal email server due to recent developments i am writing to supplement my previous testimony comey wrote in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he added although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony comey concluded humas estranged sexting husband according to a new report released via the new york times the presidential campaign was rocked on friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the nowclosed investigation into hillary clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to anthony d weiner the estranged husband of a top clinton aide in a letter to congress the fbi director james b comey said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case which law enforcement officials said was an fbi investigation into illicit text messages from mr weiner to a yearold girl in north carolina mr weiner a former democratic congressman from new york is married to huma abedin the top aide comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting clinton off the hook for mishandling and lying to congress about classified emails coming through her home brew email server while she was secretary of state after previously closing the case comey has done a uturn and is now saying the fbi will review the new emails to for classified information and see whether it was mishandled this unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a wikileaks docudump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between clinton foundation donors and former president bill clinton s private financial activities among those included in the memo was a million dollar business arrangement under bill clinton inc with another million dollar deal scheduled over nine years the following is a tweet from brad jaffy of nbc nightly news containing the new fbi recommendation the new investigation into the clinton camp will most certainly spark new paytoplay allegations as the new fbi revelations also comes days after a project veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners discussed ways to commit largescale voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at donald trump rallies out of creamers visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky some times white house visitor records show that schakowsky took private meetings with obama or his senior staff also over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability caught on film

see below antitrump violence is already sweeping the nation if trump were to actually win the election that would likely send the radical left into a violent postelection temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before alternatively there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by hillary clinton and as i showed yesterday it appears that voting machines in texas are already switching votes from donald trump to hillary clinton if hillary clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country at this moment there is less than two weeks to go until november th and a brand new survey has found that a majority of americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day a majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on election day one in five are very concerned three of four say they have confidence that the united states will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked american democracy for more than years but just say they are very confident about that more than four in of trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of clinton as president if she prevails because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square but many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence on wednesday donald trumps star on the walk of fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pickax donald trump took a lot of hits today and not just in the presidential race with less than two weeks to go before america decides if the ex apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over hillary clinton trumps star on the hollywood walk of fame was destroyed early wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a tinseltown first and there were two other instances earlier this year when donald trumps star was also vandalized one came in january and the other happened in june this is of course not the first time the gop candidates star has been attacked or defaced since trump announced his white house bid in summer the most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at hollywood blvd in late january in june this summer a mute sign was painted on trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign in both cases trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day we have seen antitrump violence on the east coast as well earlier this month someone decided to firebomb the republican party headquarters in orange county north carolina on the building next to the headquarters someone spraypainted nazi republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika there have also been other disturbing incidents of antitrump violence all over the nation in recent days a recent lifezette article put together quite a long list and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece on oct in bangor maine vandals spraypainted about parked cars outside a trump rally trump supporter paul foster whose van was hit with white paint told reporters why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars all of this to make their statement around oct a couple of trump supporters were assaulted in zeitgeist a san francisco bar after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for trump gotnews reports the two trump supporters were attacked punched and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back lilian kim of abc bay area tweeted a photo of the men in which one was wearing a trump tshirt and the other was wearing a blue lives matter shirt on sept in el cajon california an angry mob at a black lives matter protest beat yearold trump supporter feras jabro for wearing a make america great again baseball cap the assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app periscope there is a move to get trump supporters to wear red on election day but in many parts of america that might just turn his supporters into easy targets lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad and a hillary clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge for example this week former congressman joe walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if donald trump loses the election former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald trump is not elected president walsh a former tea party congressman from illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host tweeted on november th im voting for trump on november th if trump loses im grabbing my musket you in and without a doubt many ordinary americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case hillary clinton is victorious the following comes from usa today since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards hillary clinton ive been buying a lot more ammunition says rick darling an engineer from harrison township in michigans detroit suburbs in a followup phone interview after being surveyed the trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election today america is more divided than i have ever seen it before and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another ironically donald trump has been working very hard to bring america together in fact he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any republican presidential candidate since if hillary clinton and the democrats win on november th things will not go well for hillary clintons political enemies the clintons used the power of the white house to go after their enemies the first time around and hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then and the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are this is something that i discussed on national television earlier this month as i write this it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a hillary clinton presidency would be but at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome out of all the candidates that we could have chosen the american people are about to put the most evil one by far into the white house perhaps donald trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate but time is rapidly slipping away and november th will be here before we know it,1

native americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavyhanded and brutal clamp down by police and national guard militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with lrad sonic weapons attack dogs tear gas tazers and even live ammunition killing horses while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up but as the saying goes water is life and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement therefore for people concerned with life giving up on this is simply unthinkable the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism and the perception that money is more important than life itself when the police and national guard attack us citizens on private property to protect corporate interests who are they really working for the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren ceo of energy transfer partners the company responsible for the project so who is kelcy warren a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering warren worked in the natural gas industry and became cochair of energy transfer equity in with business partner ray davis coowner of the texas rangers baseball team warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nations largest pipeline companies which now owns about miles of pipelines carrying natural gas natural gas liquids refined products and crude oil the companys holdings include sunoco southern union and regency energy partners forbes estimates the yearold warrens personal wealth at billion bloomberg described him as among americas new shale tycoons but rather than building a fortune by drilling he takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another chilling boiling pressurizing and processing it until its worth more than when it burst from the wellhead source shockingly in the governor of texas greg abbott appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another million pipeline project according to the governors office the state parks and wildlife commission manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas along with ensuring the future of hunting fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans source this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post his petition is described here most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline the dallasbased billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fasttracking a mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation no environmental impact assessment no respect for cultural sites and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river a similar story is unfolding out in west texas where warrens company has split through the pristine big bend region with the mile comanche trail pipeline and nearlycomplete mile trans pecos pipeline these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a year term as of the commissioners who preside over texas parks and wildlife why probably the in campaign contributions abbott received from warren footage of militarized police using the long range acoustic device lrad crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on october th final thoughts warren is listed as number on forbes list of wealthiest americans with an estimated net worth of billion in september of he is the head of the dakota access pipeline snake if you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating gassing and attacking peaceful resistors including women children and the elderly the answer is they are doing it to protect the interests of kelcy warren and others invested in this pipeline project read more articles by isaac davis isaac davis is a staff

donald trumps campaign the media have covered him dishonestly they have consistently portrayed him as a closet white supremacist who deliberately appeals to racists they have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the altright they are now working on another dishonest angle that donald trump is mainstreaming hate and bringing racism into public discourse the media clearly want to stampede voters into mrs clintons camp so as to spare us the agony of a racist in the white house the demonization campaign has backfired by trying to hang racial dissidents around donald trumps neck the media have given american renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before at the same time constant shouts of racist and bigot dont seem to hurt mr trump instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility the biggest irony though is that donald trump is probably not one of us at all but even small deviations from the castiron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about donald trump as a secret david duke fan media dishonesty started immediately when mr trump pointed out that some immigrants from mexico were criminals the press acted as if he had said all mexican immigrants are criminals then when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call haters and white supremacists liked mr trump there was no end of articles with titles such as meet the horde of neonazis klansmen and other extremist leaders endorsing donald trump top racists and neonazis back donald trump heil donald trump neonazis white supremacists show support and the white nationalists who support donald trump these articles had a simpleminded purpose discredit mr trump by parading before the reader any nazi kluxer or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate the implication was that if racists were going to vote for donald trump he must be racist too this was deceitful and onesided when the chairman of the american communist party endorsed hillary clinton no one suggested this meant she was a communist it is true that mr trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet bigot because he did not repudiate racists with the snorts of indignation respectability requires there was the famous exchange in february when a reporter pushed mr trump to disavow an endorsement from david duke as the hill reported it david duke endorsed me ok alright i disavow ok trump said seeking to quickly move on to another question that same month there was another famous exchange with jake tapper of cnn tapper will you unequivocally condemn david duke and say that you dont want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election donald trump well just so you understand i dont know anything about david duke ok i dont know anything about what youre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists so i dont know i dont know did he endorse me or whats going on because you know i know nothing about david duke i know nothing about white supremacists the media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy trump refuses to disavow white supremacists thats because he is one there are far better explanations first donald trump is a pugnacious man he doesnt like being pushed around by anyone especially not by journalists who hate him if mr tapper had belligerently demanded that mr trump agree that the sky is blue mr trump would have bridled at that second donald trump probably doesnt know anything about david duke or white supremacy i would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of david duke or any other alleged white supremacist it is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers not some carefully concealed racial consciousness the press has also pounced on donald trumps retweets of racist material which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist business insider for example published this shocking story times donald trump has engaged with altright racists on twitter not one of these tweets is obviously racist and it would be surprising if mr trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets realdonaldtrump has sent during the campaign now the press is working on another smeartrump angle recently i have been contacted by journalists from such places as bloomberg news reuters and the new york times who clearly want to write that donald trump is mainstreaming hate that he is responsible for a huge surge in the altright they want to know about all the people who have been flocking to amrencom because of what donald trump says they want me to tell them about people who have been emboldened to speak out against minorities because donald trump has led the way they would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting nigger because mr trump wants to take a hard look at muslim immigrants i have explained to them as patiently as i can that they have it the wrong way around no one comes looking for amrencom because donald trump wants to build a wall they come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that mr trump is a racist they come looking for us because mrs clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the altright and her basket of deplorables i also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold donald trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him few people would have heard of the altright in their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors they are promoting the altright not donald trump i explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign it is trayvon martin michael brown black lives matters and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way not donald trump this will not change whether mr trump wins or loses the top landing pages on amrencom are analyses of race and crimesomething mr trump never talks about i also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think mr trump has mainstreamed hate by which they mean sensible observations about race i ask them to name a single person who has been emboldened to say something racist just because donald trump is the gop nominee of course they cant if anything it is the opposite mr trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest most commonsense observations about muslims and immigration anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever things could change if mr trump becomes president but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas what donald trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that mitt romney and john mccain are no different from barack obama when it comes to preserving whites their society and their culture i know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in november i know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the trump campaign i point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about giving the voters real choices i note that the trumpclinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election havent our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement especially among the young well now they have engagement alright but they dont like it they dont like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a threat to democracy liberals are such transparent hypocrites they claim to love democracy but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to the whole trumpisaracist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become i may be wrong but i have no reason to think donald trump thinks at all as we do he has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary american with normal instincts he doesnt want criminals sneaking across the border he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy he doesnt see why we need more muslims and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare millions of ordinary americans clearly agree with him and not because they are racially aware it is because they are decent fairminded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways i am convinced that mr trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race so far as i can tell he doesnt have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything he has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time but not because he is one of us maybejust maybehe will move in our direction its not impossible to imagine a president trump asking in an offhand way whats wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the united states or he might casually note that you cant expect as many blacks as asians in ap classes because they dont have the same levels of intelligence but i can imagine the opposite too president trump so bogged down in beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall there is one thing that donald trump has changed he has proven that republican bromides about taxes and small government dont excite people he has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties he has proven that americans do want their country to come first they dont want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries and even if he has not mainstreamed racism he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an american on october roger cohen wrote in the new york times that donald trump is a phony liar blowhard cheat bully misogynist demagogue predator bigot bore egomaniac racist sexist sociopath and a dictatorinwaiting with a brats temper and a prigs scowl this must be one of the most unhinged hysterical outbursts in the history of american political journalism and it is unusual only for its wordiness not its tone dont the editors of the times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more americans believe in bigfoot percent than trust newspapers percent virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at donald trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself open petulant bias is driving more and more americans to social media and to sites like amrencom for their news despite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire american ruling class donald trump is going to get close to half of the vote on november some million people are going to vote for a man for whom roger cohen has emptied his dictionary trying to insult only one major newspaper has endorsed donald trump only one and this is a man whom the american people might choose as their president what better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion between what americans think and what our rulers want us to think donald trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity whether he wins or not whether he is one of us or not donald trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors votersfinallyhave a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system on november th they could bring it crashing down but even if it still stands it is visibly weakened badly discredited these are the perfect conditions in which our ideas will flourish as never before,0

agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society a determined young man with a strong sense of his destiny to save his country from postmodern collapse october culture the global population in was about one billion people today it stands at over seven times that amount with the rapidly growing populations of india and africa expected to increase that to at least nine billion over the coming years readers today are well used to the idea that the global south is densely populated relative to its economic size and area but this was not always the case prior to the collapse of empire europe having undergone thorough industrialization was the most densely populated continent in the world source the world at six billion united nations un dept of economic and social affairs population division europe was also where the worlds social justice movementsliberalism communism and feminismbegan overthrowing the old order of kings castes and courtship with the vulgar and degenerate world we suffer today but why did this happen why did the immense increase of wealth and prosperity not correspond to an increase of human happiness but instead lead to the emasculation of men the breakdown of the family and the disappearance of religion and morality in these series of articles i examine the root causes of this paradox what one can do about it on an individual dietary level and what one can do about it on an individual environmental level i am a strong believer in social change through individual growth and having experienced a dramatic turnaround in the quality of my own personality and success of my outcomes as a result of following these strategies i hope that others can benefit from my knowledge and similarly make themselves into solid men popular mainstream theories for social degeneration many authors have postulated economic reasons for this degenerationindustrialization having deprived men of their primary roles as the masters of nature reduced their worth and attractivenessor utilityin the eyes of women relatedly others argue that technological progress which increased independence and ability for all allowed women to go their own way another popular argument is that increased prosperity leads to reduced incentive for disciplinerselection versus kselectionand so prosperous disciplined societies create a generation of lazy youngsters fat off the success of their parents who cause so much havoc with their short sighted policies that their civilization collapses leading to a new generation of disciplined youngsters who again create greatness one example of a shortsighted policy would be the feminist political movement which artificially separated woman from man by giving her through affirmative action socially harmful economic independence while all these explanations bear some truth none of them delve into the deeply emotional spiritual human and thus fundamentally biological causes of social degeneration why the mainstream theories are flawed to begin with a healthy man and a healthy woman even with modern technology at their disposal should not so substantially less love and cherish each other as seems to be the case today the proof of this can be seen by examining what it is women do with that technology a modern loose woman uses technology to go to places where men can ravish her even if it gives woman the ability to go it alone technology does not diminish her emotional and biological need for man further the availability of technology does not always translate into its adoptionthe failure of google glass is the emblematic example it does not have to be the case that smartphones are automatically adopted for slut culturethey do not have to automatically lead to female promiscuity anyone familiar with russian or japanese women who have the same technology at hand but a vastly greater sense of restraint and selfworth can attest to this fact therefore the technological argument is not sufficient to explain modern degeneracy although it is certainly a necessary condition credit ninaras credit moguphotos to briefly examine the argument that men no longer have nonfinancial utility in the eyes of women a man is not necessarily attractive to a woman if he actually breaks rocks or actually kills other peopleinstead being able to is sufficient therefore the emotional and spiritual inseparability of a healthy woman from her evolved master man remains and will remain eternally true the change in technology and the nature of mens work is not the causal factorinstead the change in preferences of both men and women explains modern degeneracy men hardly today want to lead and possess their woman and women do not respond to weakling men let us examine the rk selection argument if it were the case that wealth and ease begat indiscipline automatically it would be true that the rich produce weak and undisciplined progeny this may seem like a truism today viewed through the lens of the postindustrial overpopulated paris hilton west but in societies of the past it was certainly not the caserather historically the opposite has been true the weak were poor because they were undisciplined and the strong were rich because they were disciplined the poor raised weak and hence undisciplined children while the rich raised strong and disciplined ones so the cycle continued and over time aristocracies formed an extreme version of this disciplinedrich mentality can be seen in modern british farmers many of whom financially wealthy and prosperous drive old beaten suvs reuse clothes and generally minimize expenditures while it cannot be denied that even the modern rich have in general become mostly degenerate this is in my opinion a disproportionately visible symptom of a deeper malaise that affects society across the board therefore i do not rely on the technological or economic explanations for societal degenerationi view these theories as descriptive of passing symptoms or trends and not timelessly causal truthsint the population growth nutritional depletion and environmental pollution theory of societal degeneration having outlined and accounted for the above theories i argue instead that the degeneration of society is caused mostly by the biological degeneration of the human being that makes up the society this degeneration is caused by factors that affect the human organism on the basest level and the two primary factors are nutritional depletion of food caused by the growth of industrial agriculture which itself is made necessary by unprecedented population growth the pollution of the environment caused by industry and the introduction of unsafe technology according to this view it was not the boomers access to ease that made them such degenerate and irresponsible scum but rather the fact that the rapid population increase during their key developmental years meant that the growth of industrial agriculture that somewhat necessarily accompanied itthe green revolutioncreated such nutritionally sparse food that there was insufficient development of boomers brains leading to a generation of overgrown children further according to this theory the increased dependence on technology is not viewed as the cause of millennial autism but rather a symptom of millennial autism recent historical examples consider the historical path of communism which did not generally spring up in the villages this was not because the landlords were better able to control the peasants but instead because poor city dwellers even if earning a higher income than poor peasants had access to much worse food and lived in a far dirtier environment making them both mentally and physically ill the unfortunate result of insufficient mental development in a crisis situation our aim should be to save as many leftists as possible and almost all can be the poor in the countryside today continue to vote conservative or liberal while the urban poor vote socialist for this same reason the rural poor despite usually being less wealthy than the urban poor are intellectually mature enough to see how harmful a controlling government can be the urban poor mostly achieve the intellectual maturity of children or adolescents and mostly feel rather than think so they support an emotionbased class war or gender war ideology this theory explains the early rise of social justice in europe where industrial agriculture was first adopted on a wide scale and also explains why such movements did not organically grow anywhere else until much later owing to the much later adoption of industrial agriculture it should be noted that in the countries where communist revolutions were actually successful they enjoyed no broad support but instead were able to defeat the mostly preindustrial historical governments because of these governments economic weakness and also because of extensive support by globalist or communist interests this was true in russia china and cambodia ancient historical examples this theory also explains the path of historical civilizationsromes case is highly instructive at its birth rome was a small collection of largely selfsufficient highly disciplined towns where the diet like in many towns of that era was a mixture of grains vegetables small farmed meats like chickens and hunted meatswhat we would call a balanced diet in this society men were the masters of their households with power of life and death over their family members while facing total responsibility for their family members behaviour only a group of strong capable and selfdisciplined individuals could sustain such a social order population of the city of rome e million inhabitants source wwwdavidgalbraithorg romes extreme martial and social discipline led to expansion as it expanded and the citys population grew the diet for most people changed over time to mostly grains farmed highly intensively shipped in from all over the empire losing a lot of its nutrition on the way simultaneously and partly as a result of rising grain production meat consumption fell reducing the populations testosterone levels leading to falling strength and willingness or ability to compete as well as rising mental illness because of copper overload the weakened populations increasing demands for emotion based socialism led to the growth of a massive welfare state and eventual bankruptcy hyperinflation and collapse of the central government india is another equally tragic example the population growth that resulted from highly prosperous nanda rule led to the growth of buddhism and the adoption of degenerate attitudes moral collapse and eventually weakness to invasion after the institutionalization of buddhism by powerhungry and utterly machiavellian psychopath ashokawho looked to weaken the brahmins hinduisms traditional moral guidesbuddhisms degenerate vegetarian curse spread like a virus and created over several generations a population of weaklings who werent again able to assert their independence for over a thousand years the song dynasty followed a similar path as these two empires being eventually overrun by the mongols the yuan dynasty population of china source vaclab smil chinas environmental crisis this degradation of the diet caused by population growth has been at least a significant causal element behind the degeneracy and collapse of most prosperous sedentary civilizations the modern context the dramatic increase of the population since ancient times should help you understand why humans today are such fools and weaklings compared to our ancestors there is only so much nutrition in the worlds topsoil to go around and a population seven times greater than years ago eating a diet uncorrected through nutritional supplementation for dietary sparsity will be living individually in effect th the life that its ancestor population did is it any wonder that people today feel so weak and helpless that they want mommy government and daddy police state to give them the illusion of comfort and security this theory is also borne out in the data in general food today contains ½ to th the nutrients it did in the s which was already about years after the adoption of modern style industrial agriculture in the west this dramatic fall in nutrition has accompanied the tripling of the global population and closeto doubling of the european population since that time while some population control seems necessary i believe that sustainable organic agriculture combined with nutritional supplementation should obviate a large amount of needed population reduction i hope that the reader is after consideration of these facts sufficiently convinced of the true causes behind the modern worlds degeneracy people have fairly universally across the political spectrum become weak and insane from malnutrition artificial protein may have allowed some men to grow muscles and calcium from an overreliance on milk may have allowed them to grow tall but perhaps the lack of most necessary nutrients has meant that they are generally still retarded emotionally spiritually and intellectually the effects on modern society this weakness amongst menand dietary sparsity has disproportionately affected men due to our much greater nutritional requirementshas not just resulted in an inability to control the destructive forces that lie latent in every society worse the fundamental outlook of men who viewed themselves as the creators of civilization the slayers of enemies and the protectors of women all under god has changed the modern millennial man is a childlike hedonist who cares little for his civilization culture or people an aspiring patriarch an example of testicular failure image credit giorgiomtbshutterstock environmental toxins environmental toxins are also a problem electrical oestrogen and toxic metal pollution are underresearched but may have devastating effects on human health radio waves plastics unfiltered medication and purposely added toxins in the water supply like fluoride and chlorine have deleterious effects too what can we do considering these realities it serves little purpose to blame women for their selfdestructive behavior while in the past like men women used to have enough emotional maturity to try to live a life of selfrespect for example by remaining virgins and not drinking alcohol they have never had much agency charisma or true self will even before the diet was empty and before they were being stuffed full of drugs and chemicals by the unscrupulous pharmaceutical industry and its proxies these poisons may cause serious and dangerous although slowly fixable hormonal and behavioral changes but the real effects are felt by their offspring unfortunately once a woman is hooked on these drugs for example the birth control pill or antidepressants she is unlikely to come off them and if she does she is unlikely to do anything to fix the damage to herself or her future children this is especially the case as the medical industry which has brainwashed her to see doctors and the state as her loving protectors is unlikely to recommend it even so these drugs dont permanently alter the fact that women as mostly emotion driven actors are biologically and intrinsically people pleasers and respond automatically to the most powerful person or group of people that can give them a raison dêtre even if we cant ensure that women in general improve their diet and avoid pollutants we can certainly make changes on an individual level convincing or browbeating our girlfriends sisters and mothers the healthier a woman gets the greater her affinity with nature becomes and the more maternal she feels so you can be fairly certain that shell try and pass on the knowledge to her children and friends like our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers did furthermore there are a large minority of health conscious women who it should be our duty to marry and impregnate as many times as possible considering the rapid population declines that will occur in the atheist and leftist segments of our countries native populations these women are our best hope for creating a viable future you will have to teach her a few things credit csp_subbotina the situation is not hopelessbut we have a fight on our hands in the past wellinformed people couldnt expect due to the limited and elitecontrolled nature of communication technology and the educational system to make any impact on the vast majority of the population the political fight against big agra and big pharma seemed hopeless today is different the growth of the internet and the increasing spread of awareness has meant that more people are aware about the importance of eating well avoiding environmental dangers and supplementing wisely this is partly evidenced by the steadily rising percentage of people who eat organic diets and the booming supplement industry i hope that in the future at least a significant portion of us can survive in a sane enough state to politically fight back against moves by globalists islamists communists and ruthless financiers who are circling like vultures over our degenerating civilizations on the other side of this political battle the globalist controlled medical industry has been the biggest proponent of unhealthy diets and dangerous and addictive drugs special interests have also been the biggest corrupters of regulators and the institutions created to defend the population against industrial and chemical pollution a system of global monopoly wealth extraction is not possible with active capable and selfconfident masculinities from proud nationstates to resist it those who seek to benefit from such a monopoly system have tried their absolute hardest to suppress natural health information but so far they have failed and the situation is only improving so there is considerable reason for hope conclusion our forefathers demanded to fulfill their destiny ordained by the gods to defend our civilizations against the forces of rapacious greed and murderous atheistic villainyto be the protectors and kings of our people today most men are mentally ill and have become childish hedonistic narcissists as expected the ruthless and soulless have exploited this weakness for their own benefit now that you have i hope understood the principles behind why most of us have lost the urge to fight to protect our cultures the cause and fix to the industrial malaise should no longer seem out of reach or impossible to grasp this area of the human condition is just one another where we stand at the crossroads of history but in my opinion it is the most important if the dietary trend of the last two centuries is not reversed and the nutritional quality of at least a significant minority of men is not substantially improved then each generation of people will become more communist more feminist and more weak than the last and the globalist special interests that seek to create a totalitarian worldmonopoly police state will win regardless of temporary political victories each of us has chosen a path to follow in our quest for spiritual intellectual and national salvation this is mine in my future articles i will detail the best dietary approach for strong men and beautiful women to follow and overview the most important environmental precautions we must take in our quest to fix the root causes of modern degeneracy i hope that ultimately you are convinced to help me and others like me prevent our world from collapsing entirely into a miserable cyberpunk dystopia oct kshatriya indransha,0

captured cubas san juan hill elected vicepresident under william mckinley he became americas youngest president in republican theodore roosevelt was the first president to invite an africanamerican booker t washington to dine in the white house on oct a southern democrat newspapers condemned him it as printed in the memphis scimitar the most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen of the united states was committed yesterday by the president when he invited a n to dine with him at the white house it would not be worth more than a passing notice if theodore roosevelt had sat down to dinner in his own home with a pullman car porter but roosevelt the individual and roosevelt the president are not to be viewed in the same light in theodore roosevelt warned the thought of modern industry in the hands of christian charity is a dream worth dreaming the thought of industry in the hands of paganism is a nightmare beyond imagining the choice between the two is upon us in the new york bible society had theodore roosevelt write a message which was inscribed in a pocket new testament book of psalms given to world war i soldiers the teachings of the new testament are foreshadowed in micahs verse micah vi what more does the lord require of thee than to do justice and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god do justice and therefore fight

your own part ny george h doran co wrote armenians for some centuries have sedulously avoided militarism and war are so suffering precisely and exactly because they have been pacifists whereas their neighbors the turks have not been pacifists but militarists t roosevelt fear god p armenians have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the napoleonic warsthe wars of genghis khan and tamerlane in asia yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged this course of national infamy began when the last administration surrendered to the peace atanyprice people and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties individuals and nations who preach the doctrine of milkandwater invariably have in them a softness of fiber which means that they fear to antagonize those who preach and practice the doctrine of bloodandiron t roosevelt fear god p american eyewitness of the fearful atrocities mr arthur h gleason new york tribune nov serbia is at this moment passing under the harrow of torture and mortal anguish now the armenians have been butchered under circumstances of murder and torture and rape that would have appealed to an oldtime apache indian even to nerves dulled and jaded by the heapedup horrors of the past year and a half the news of the terrible fate that has befallen the armenians must give a fresh shock of sympathy and indignation let me emphatically point out that the sympathy is useless unless it is accompanied with indignation and that the indignation is useless if it exhausts itself in words instead of taking shape in deeds if this people through its government had not shirked its duty we would now be able to take effective action on behalf of armenia mass meetings on behalf of the armenians amount to nothing whatever if they are mere methods of giving a sentimental but ineffective and safe outlet to the emotion of those engaged in them the principles of the peaceatanyprice men of the professional pacifists will be as absolutely ineffective for international righteousness this crowning iniquity of the wholesale slaughter of the armenians must be shared by the neutral powers headed by the united states for their failure to protest when this initial wrong was committed the devastation of poland and serbia has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the seventeenthcentury europe weak and timid milkandwater policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the bloodandiron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world the crowning outrage has been committed by the turks on the armenians they have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of attila and of genghis khan it is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks neutral not only in deed but in thought between right and the most hideous wrong neutral between despairing and hunted people people whose little children are murdered and their women raped and the victorious and evil wrongdoers i trust that all americans worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful armenian atrocities i trust that they feel that a peace obtained without righting the wrongs of the armenians would be worse than any war wrongdoing will only be stopped by men who are brave as well as just who put honor above safety who are true to a lofty ideal of duty who prepare in advance to make their strength effective and who shrink from no hazard not even the final hazard of war if necessary in order to serve the great cause of righteousness when our people take this stand we shall also be able effectively to take a stand in international matters which shall prevent such cataclysms of wrong as have been witnesseson an even greater scale in armenia t roosevelt fear god pp in his book fear god and take your part theodore roosevelt wrote christianity is not the creed of asia and africa at this moment solely because the seventh century christians of asia and africa had trained themselves not to fight whereas the moslems were trained to fight christianity was saved in europe solely because the peoples of europe fought if the peoples of europe in the th and th centuries and on up to and including the th century had not possessed a military equality with and gradually a growing superiority over the mohammedans who invaded europe europe would at this moment be mohammedan and the christian religion would be exterminated a contemporary of theodore roosevelt was the english author gk chesterton who wrote of western christian civilization the collected works of gk chesterton volume xx introduction and notes by james v schall ignatius press they seem entirely to forget that long before the crusaders had dreamed of riding to jerusalem the moslems had almost ridden into paris theodore roosevelt continued in fear god and take your part wherever the mohammedans have had complete sway wherever the christians have been unable to resist them by the sword christianity has ultimately disappeared from the hammer of charles martel to the sword of jan sobieski christianity owed its safety in europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and

funneled through a belize bank to use in this years presidential election campaign until its decision was about to be made public in a series of undercover videos by james okeefes project veritas action suddenly the head of the organization expressed suspicion about the donations overseas origin and decided to return it thats one of the significant revelations in the latest in a series of videos released by okeefe called rigging the election okeefe explained he had a fictitious donor meet with bob creamer who was a staffer at americans united for change a group supporting clinton for president until the videos started appearing last week he said creamer who boasted of working directly for the clinton campaign directed that the donation go to aufc to disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops okeefe said he and his colleagues were very careful not to violate the law themselves creamer was clear about his ties to clinton stating every morning i am on a call at that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters sign the precedentsetting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton project veritas first video explained how the clinton campaign uses hidden connections to incite violence at donald trump rallies its second video showed plans for stepbystep voter fraud and the third exposed prohibited communications between hillary clintons campaign the dnc and the nonprofit americans united for change the fourth video breaks down the process of the longterm investigation it comes after creamers announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities okeefe and project veritas action have filed a complaint with the federal election commission among the revelations in the latest video was creamer was boasting of his close links to president obama oh barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics i mean the second one i mean the first was good too i was a consultant to both the second one was everything hit on every level and every aspect he said hes a pro ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago when asked whether a potential donor could meet obama creamer said ok you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in days i was just at an event with him in chicago friday of last week he is just as good as ever i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in i mean for immigration reform for the the health care bill trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues explained project veritas the more that was promised to creamer the more access project veritas action journalists seemed to get project veritas actions investment paid off the story was solid robert creamer scott foval jenna price from the dnc brad woodhouse from aufc cesar vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings as seen in the three previous pva videos in the first video foval a democratic operative boasted of what he called conflict engagement or sending protesters to disrupt trump events were starting anarchy here he said and he needs to understand that were starting anarchy in the second video creamer explained clintons direct control over those disruption operations in the end it was the candidate hillary clinton the future president of the united states who wanted ducks on the ground so by god we would get ducks on the ground creamer said creamer the husband of democratic rep jan schakowsky of illinois has starred in several of the undercover videos heres the third that video also revealed a direct conflict between what creamer was confirming clintons active involvement in such decisions and campaigns and the claim of her campaign manager robby mook mook told cnn over the weekend that there was no pathway between the activists staging violence and clinton sign the precedentsetting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton these individuals no longer have a relationship with the dnc he said theyve never had a relationship with the clinton campaign and my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened i think in february of last year they did not have a contract with the dnc until june but putting all that aside this was again a video that was leaked out with the purpose of damaging the campaign it is edited so we dont know what the full context is and theres no evidence whatsoever that anyone ever did anything like this when they were working for the dnc his comments after confirming it was clinton or wanted ducks on the ground creamer warned undercover project veritas journalists dont repeat that to anybody creamer ran democracy partners a consulting company with ties to clinton he has been to the white house times while obama has been president including meetings directly with obama okeefes organization reported that the coordination between the campaign the dnc and the americans united for change smacks of illegal coordinated campaign expenditures last week project veritas filed a complaint with the federal election commission asking for an investigation into the clinton campaigns criminal conspiracy the filing of the complaint with the federal agency follows the release of two videos in which democrats explain how they can attempt to change the outcome of the election through apparently fraudulent means such as having people travel across state lines to vote illegally the video have resulted already in two democratic operatives losing their jobs editors note be aware of offensive language throughout videos and in quotes from videos one is scott foval who had worked for people for the american way a george sorosfunded group and more recently with americans united for change in the video he said you know what weve been busing people in to deal with you fing aes for years and were not going to stop now also he said he and his agents are starting anarchy by creating conflict engagement in the lines at trump rallies also out of work is creamer see the second video talkradio icon rush limbaugh said the evidence is worrisome every trump rally would feature none of this violence unless the democrats were paying for it i think its a big deal folks the media is complicit they know who these people are theyre in on it theyre part of the game none of its organic none of its natural none of its real every bit of it is bought and paid for democrats cant leave elections to chance because they know that despite the way it may look the majority of americans would not support them if they knew who they are

hillary clinton to escape legal accountability for her actions from attorney general loretta lynch on down through the justice departments political ranks the department has blocked the fbi from searching for the truth and following the evidence of potential criminality to its logical conclusion whether it is hillarys use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state or her involvement in the payforplay clinton enterprise known as the clinton foundation the obama administration is applying a banana republicstyle double standard to pervert justice and the rule of law in order to shield her lynch and president obama were reportedly furious with fbi director james comey for sending a letter to congress on october th indicating that new evidence potentially pertinent to the email case had come to light which required further investigation this evidence consisted of a batch of emails fbi investigators had found on one or more computers belonging to anthony weiner clinton confidante huma abedins estranged husband while they were searching for evidence in an unrelated case involving weiners alleged sexting to an underage girl comey sent his letter after months of agonizing over his previous decision to let hillary off the hook in the email case last july he was said by a source close to him to have been particularly disturbed by the mounting number of resignation letters from fbi agents who felt betrayed by that decision department of justice officials had leaned on comey not to send the letter to congress claiming that it would violate department protocols and procedures against taking any action that could be perceived as interfering with the upcoming presidential election to his credit comey ignored the department officials objections claiming he had an obligation to keep the congress and the public informed of any potentially significant new developments in the case democrats who had lavished praise on comey for his july decision lashed out at comey for sending his letter updating congress senate minority leader harry reid went so far as to make the baseless charge that comey may have violated the law by informing congress because reid argued he appeared to be taking sides in an election the disgraced former attorney general eric holder held in contempt of congress for withholding information relating to the fast and furious scandal said about comeys action i fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the justice department and the fbi it is up to the director to correct his mistake not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the american people since when has holder been genuinely concerned about protecting our system of justice and best serving the american people holder had already contributed to the erosion of public trust with his blatant politicization of the obama department of justice as evidenced by the obama department of justices handling of the multiple fbi investigations involving hillary clinton the department has continued its slide into the muck of corruption it interfered with both the normal course of criminal investigations and the election by stacking the deck in hillarys favor ensuring that no indictment would occur to derail her path to succeed obama and preserve his legacy first the department of justice reportedly refused to empanel a grand jury in either the email case or in connection with the fbis investigation of the clinton foundation payforplay allegations the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation former assistant fbi director james kallstrom said thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that kallstroms belief that lynch acted to influence the results of the fbi probes in hillarys favor is buttressed by lynchs minute private tarmac meeting with bill clinton shortly before fbi director comey faced the cameras on july th with his exculpatory announcement second at least five immunity agreements were handed out in the email case including to hillarys lawyer and confidante cheryl mills and to platte river networks paul combetta it appears that combetta had previously lied to government investigators a crime in itself while trying to cover up the fact that he had evidently bleachbited emails to delete them even though they had been subject to a previously issued congressional subpoena the immunity agreements garnered nothing in return but had the effect of blocking access to the computer devices of the immunity beneficiaries in the fbis separate clinton foundation investigation apparently the department decided against the alternative option of subpoenaing the computer devices or seeking a search warrant rather than granting useless immunities in order to obtain any evidence relevant to the email investigation that might have been contained in those devices third the department and fbi did not conduct their last minute interview of hillary clinton under oath and allowed cheryl mills herself a material witness to sit in during hillarys interview they did not ask pertinent followup questions there was no verbatim transcript of the interview to use in checking the veracity of hillarys statements during the interview against her sworn congressional testimony or her many public statements fourth the department of justice reportedly refused to allow the fbi to issue subpoenas to gather more evidence in connection with its investigation of the clinton foundation payforplay allegations in fact senior department officials reportedly would not authorize a more thorough fbi investigation because they claimed there was not sufficient evidence gathered thus far to justify going further such a circular argument was a mere cover to prevent seasoned career investigators from learning the full extent of foreign government donations while hillary was secretary of state their true motivations and any favors extended by the state department in return finally the crossconnections between the clintons and some high level department of justice and fbi officials cry out for recusal but not so in this administration for example the wife of the deputy fbi director who was involved in the laggard clinton foundation investigation andrew mccabe just happened to have received a large donation from close clinton ally virginia governor terry mcauliffe to her run for the state senate to make matters worse the obama department of justice assigned assistant attorney general peter j kadzik a close friend of hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta to communicate with congress about what kadzik promised would be a thorough review of the newly discovered emails from anthony weiners online account podesta praised kadzik in an email to an obama campaign official back in as a fantastic lawyer and said about his pal kept me out of jail their history together goes further back than that during the waning days of bill clintons presidency it was kadzik then representing the infamous billionaire fugitive marc rich who lobbied podesta then serving as bill clintons chief of staff for a presidential pardon on his clients behalf kadziks lobbying effort no doubt helped along by contributions to hillary clintons senate campaign and to bill clintons presidential library paid off bill clinton delivered the requested pardon on his last day in office kadzik joined the department of justice in april first as a deputy assistant attorney general for legislative affairs and then as the principal deputy with the podesta connection intact kadzik has served as a highly placed clinton campaign mole in the department an email dated may from kadzik to podesta released by wikileaks proves the point bearing the subject heading heads up kadzik advised podesta about upcoming congressional testimony by the head of the departments civil division and about another filing in the freedom of information case that would mean it will be awhile before the state department posts the emails podesta forwarded kadziks heads up email to several senior hillary clinton campaign officials with the admonition additional chances for mischief exploiting his coordinating role in the reopened email investigation and contacts with fbi investigators kadzik will now be in a position to relay inside information to his pal podesta and to provide inside information to the clinton campaigns supporters in congress as well the clintons manage to turn virtually everything they touch into a cesspool of corruption the obama department of justice is no exception,1

fulfilling orders november work money to launch a return of kings tshirt shop i decided to go with shopify because of how much easier it is to launch than a selfhosted store i signed up with them paid for one year of service and did a prelaunch with a small group of readers which resulted in orders as i began fulfilling them shopify pulled the plug on the entire store without warning both the public storefront and the administrative backend with all our data because of shopifys decision my customers couldnt access their order status i had no way of informing them of what happened and i couldnt fulfill remaining orders they put both me and individuals in the lurch for no legitamate reason forcing me to threaten legal action in order to get enough information to complete fulfillment of all orders the backstory there are many open source solutions for hosting a web store the problem with them is that it takes extra time to create the store and maintain it compared to services like shopify squarespace bigcommerce magento and others to get the rok store up and running as quickly as possible i picked shopify because of their competitive prices not knowing that i was in for a far greater price down the road after i set up the store featuring photos of yours truly in our first tshirt i collected email addresses of those who were most interested with participating in the prelaunch i sent this group an email announcing the store and of them took action ordering a tshirt or two the shirt in question during this time i received an email from a shopify risk analyst by the name of justin he asked me to send in identification which i was happy to do and then asked me for more information thanks for signing up with shopify payments and providing your id in order to complete this initial review and ensure payments continue to be sent to your account we would need a little bit more information if you could send me any documentation you may have to validate the business that would be great examples would be a business bank statement business license or business registration documents could you also confirm where youre primarily operating your business from i sent in my business incorporation documents my irs employer number designation a recent bank statement from my usbased bank and a note of how i often travel through eastern europe but that my business bank accounts and tax status all reside in the united states in spite of that shopify unjustly classified me as a foreign business and gave me no means to dispute it unfortunately shopify payments is currently only available to companies that are based in australia canada united kingdom and the united states so we are not able to help with payments for your site right now its frustrating for us to have to turn down good businesses but we need to make sure were abiding by both us and international regulations this means that any successful charges you have will be transferred to you on schedule but you wont be able to use shopify payments to accept any further payments despite the information provided our payment processing partner needs to ensure that the shops are based operating from and have a substantial presence in the united states ultimately their decision is final and we must respect it according to the united states federal government and the irs my company is american and liable to pay american taxes but to shopify im not an american business the repercussion from this was that i couldnt use shopifys own payment system shopify payments and had to pay a extra commision on all orders but this wasnt a huge setback since there were many other payment options i stayed the course because i wanted to do an ontime opening for my readers i could always change stores later when it was convenient for me the disaster i have a worker based in the united states who maintains the shirt inventory and is charge of shipping them out he printed most of the shipping labels for the first batch of orders and got ready for shipment before he was finished i tried to log into the admin area of the store to monitor his progress and saw this the public storefront was also taken down there was no longer any way for me to know who my customers were and what they ordered i couldnt even send them an email i then received this from justin hello im afraid that after reviewing your information and website we believe your business presents a level of risk for customer disputes that we will be unable to support on shopify we will transfer your existing payments to you but will be unable to accept any additional payments on your behalf from shopify payments im sorry we wont be able to help with your business regards justin after i read this email i was absolutely livid ive been doing business on the internet for over fifteen years and have never had a situation where a company pulled the rug out from under me and my customers in a way that i would personally classify as fraud they allowed me to take orders begin processing them and then removed all access so i could not complete fulfillment imagine if you bought a shirt from me and then tried to access the store to see the status of your order you would have no way to know whats going on and would probably think that i took your money and ran shopify created a situation of unneeded worry for individuals while directly hurting my reputation as if im running some sort a scam operation the phone call to support i called support and got on the line with a level support tech i told him the situation as calmly as i could his response send an email reply to justin this was unacceptable because politely complying with him through email beforehand had only resulted in the deletion of my entire store without warning i demanded to speak with someone from the risk department but the support tech told me there was no way to patch me through since he was working remotely i was not calling shopifys main office but someone sitting in the middle of nowhere in his pajamas i also told the support tech that there was no further information asked of me that this was a unilateral closing of my shop while i was in the middle of fulfillment if shopify is so worried about fraud why would they leave individuals in a position where they would believe they got defrauded and start initiating chargebacks with their credit card companies i had no choice but to threaten legal action i told the support tech that if shopify doesnt give me a way to complete these orders i would pursue all legal means as a response to what i saw as fraud the support tech put me on hold after a few minutes of chatting with the risk team he said that they have given him permission to send me a csv file of all my orders i decided that this was enough to satisfy the individuals who purchased from me but it still didnt allow me an easyway to process exchanges or refunds if one of my customers was unsatisfied with the shirt before ending the call with the support tech i told him to relay to justin and his team that they have created so much ill will by the way they have treated me that i will ensure that everyone knows exactly what they did not just to me but also to my customers who had an unfortunate experience because of their ecommerce platform using the csv file i received i was able to contact my customers to let them know of the situation and complete fulfillment many of them have already received their tshirts in the mail the lesson shopify has every right to choose who to do business with and i would not be particularly upset if they said i have to go elsewhere after fulfilling open orders but the way they removed all access from my store is absolutely reprehensible and the stuff of nightmares for a business owner no owner wants to wake up one day and find that everything is gone with no way to contact his customers i have never been treated so poorly by an american internet business before and im confident that any business who treats people in this way wont be in business for long maybe my situation was special as i am often abroad but shopify operates as if its customers are not even allowed to take a vacation out of the country if you log in from a certain ip address pool their algorithms go crazy and here comes justin to hit the delete button on your store with one click whatever the reason its important for existing and potential shopify customers to know that it doesnt take much for them to shut you down at any moment and for any cause they will take all your information and prevent you from contacting customers or fulfilling orders your only recourse to receive your data is to threaten legal action and that may be no guarantee of success if any of my friends ask me about which web store platform to use i will strongly warn them against shopify as for the rok store ive decided to try the open source method hopefully we will be ready for orders

assault that killed americans in libya could have been prevented by matt apuzzo and kimberly dozier september am washington ap the heavily armed extremists who laid siege to the us consulate in libya used militarystyle tactics that may have steered americans toward a waiting ambush us officials said friday as they pieced together details about how the compound was overrun us intelligence indicates that or more people many of them masked were responsible for the sept assault on the us diplomatic mission in benghazi gun trucks provided added firepower the attackers set up a perimeter controlling access in and out of the compound a first wave of attacks sent the americans fleeing to a fallback building where a second group of extremists beset them with precise mortar fire intelligence reports were still coming in but officials told the associated press that what may have initially seemed like a protest over an antiislam movie that had spun out of control now showed the hallmarks of a more sophisticated operation in a country coming off a civil war a level of battlefield savvy does not prove the attack on the compound was planned well in advance how much planning went into the operation and whether it could have been detected or prevented remain unanswered questions officials said the attacks killed ambassador chris stevens diplomat sean smith and two former navy seals who us officials said were security officers guarding diplomatic officials stevens was visiting benghazi from tripoli to preside over the opening of an american space cultural center the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss intelligence reports they stressed that even now authorities do not have a clear understanding of exactly what happened in benghazi fbi agents from new york and washington were in libya investigating the attack what happened in benghazi was a terrorist attack secretary of state hillary clinton said friday and we will not rest

with rebels militias and terrorists weaponry is easy to come by both from the former regime from weapons depots looted during the war and from foreign powers that armed the rebellion the origin of the weapons used in the assault on the us compound was unclear officials said mortar training device with functional simulated propelling charges us a abstract a fullsize mortar training device which includes fullsize simulated propelling charges is disclosed both mm and mm mortar training devices are disclosed the device provides realistic training on virtually all aspects of mortar firing the device allows training in target sight acquisition and mortar positioning elevation and azimuth sight reacquisition due to recoil dropping a round adjusting the number of charges as required to achieve a desired zone of firing distance adjusting the projectile fuse setting to control time of explosion provides realistic firing sound and allows trainees to follow procedures similar to those used with standard mortar service ammunition the device includes a cartridge projectile which contacts a pad within and at the lowermost point of the mortar barrel which is not propelled from the mortar barrel and which provides data to a computer system to determine if an area or object would have been impacted by the mortar projectile provides analysis of trainee firing errors and provides for the simulation to be replayed for trainee instructional and other purposes the mm device includes a handheld firing option and the mm device includes a blast attenuator device to further enhance

pressurised environment they are an ideal way of developing solutions procedures and plans rather than the focus being on decision making table top exercises these involve a realistic scenario and will follow a time line either in realtime or with time jumps to concentrate on the more important areas the participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise tabletop exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations commandcontrol post exercises these are designed primarily to exercise the senior leadership and support staff in collective planning and decision making within a strategic grouping ideally such exercises would be run from the real command and control locations

early s at the british intelligence agency gchq where james ellis clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in by diffie hellman rivest shamir and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards

lynchs career will go down with her heck maybe theyll even be cellmates loretta lynchs ties to the clintons go back to when thenpresident bill clinton appointed her to run the brooklyn us attorneys office she left in and went into private practice but returned to the brooklyn office in at the behest of president barack obama heres her official bio in she was sworn in to become the rd attorney general of the united states taking the place of the blatantly corrupt attorney general eric holder who will probably be most famous for his roles in the fast and furious operation inciting racial tensions and his mishandling of the lois lernerirs debacle first there was the secret airplane meeting with bill clinton it all started to publicly go downhill for lynch during the first investigation into hillary clintons carelessness with national secrets via her home email server right before fbi director james comey was to meet with hillary clinton to interrogate her about the subject lynch was busted having a secret meeting with bill clinton the washington post reported clintons private unplanned meeting with attorney general loretta e lynch at the phoenix airport last week coming at a time when the justice department should be nearing completion of its examination of hillary clintons use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state will inevitably and negatively affect public attitudes about that investigation lynch has tried to make amends though not without leaving some confusion in her wake in a conversation friday with washington post editorial writer jonathan capehart at the aspen ideas festival she insisted again that the conversation was innocent about grandchildren and golf and such and did not touch on the investigation of the emails but she said she recognized that others would not see it that way the fact that the meeting that i had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that i take seriously and deeply and painfully she said lynch said that she would be accepting whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and fbi director james b comey bring her though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case she also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public of course it was all much easier for lynch to abide by the decision when comey miraculously found that hillary clinton was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets now though people are asking questions about that illfounded meeting judicial watch has filed a lawsuit for all records related to the illicit meeting between attorney general lynch and former president bill clinton on june attorney general loretta lynch is reported to have met privately with former president bill clinton on board a parked private plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the thenongoing investigation of mrs clintons email server and mere hours before the benghazi report was released publicly involving both mrs clinton and the obama administration judicial watch filed a request on june that the us department of justice office of the inspector general investigate that meeting republican presidential nominee donald trump suggested that during that meeting bill clinton may have offered to extend lynchs position in the ags office during a hillary clinton administration then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious iranian ransom payment last week ag lynch blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the obama administration made to iran by pleading the fifth the washington free beacon reported attorney general loretta lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran billion in cash earlier this year prompting accusations that lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon it is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the peoples elected representatives in congress about an important national security issue the lawmakers wrote your staff failed to address any of our questions and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue as the united states chief law enforcement officer it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries they stated the actions of your department come at time when iran continues to hold americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison how very judicial of her lynch tried to shut comey up about the new investigation into the clinton emails now even the mainstream media cant turn its head earlier i wrote about the fact that fbi director james comey made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the hillary clinton emails but lets talk a little further about lynchs desperate attempts to shut him up the new york times reported that the justice department strongly discouraged comey against releasing the information the day before the fbi director james b comey sent a letter to congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed hillary clinton email investigation the justice department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy three law enforcement officials said on saturday senior justice department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter officials said but they did everything short of it pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections how interesting that its seen as influencing the election to investigate someone now but it wasnt back when she was investigated and not charged im not sure exactly how that works but according to usa today emphasis mine a federal official familiar with comeys decision said saturday that the fbi director considered the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter thursday and early friday but felt compelled to act do you remember janet reno poor janet was another attorney general who went down for the clintons she was also sworn in as ag under bill clinton and many questioned her appointment at the time according to a report in the chicago tribune she arrived in washington from miami as caesars wife and so she has remained she was ignorant and independent of insider dc and has stayed that way bill clinton never much liked her and never confided in her and she reciprocated she became ag just in time to take the fall for the debacle in waco actually according to historycom the waco standoff had already begun by the time janet reno became the first female attorney general on march she approved the fbis tear gas plan the following month explaining that negotiations with the branch davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk we will never know whether there was a better solution reno said in everyone involved made their best judgments based on all the information we had nonetheless a republicanled congressional report called her decision premature wrong and highly irresponsible she was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements the tribune post continued to discuss renos position as a scapegoat every day since she took office she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to clintonwhitewater fundraising lewinsky china espionage etc clinton cant afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her but no such attorney general could have survived the clinton scandals much less survived them with her own reputationand her departmentsintact attorney generals who have anything to do with the clintons dont seem to fare too well they end up so embroiled in clinton scandals that they too are pulled down into the mire regardless of what their intentions were when they started out lynch can see her futureand it has something to do with help wanted ads the last time lynch was involved in the clinton email kerfuffle she promised to abide by fbi director james comeys recommendation i wonder if shell make that same promise this time she really cant because if she does it will show she was complicit with the clintons the last time around and also this time when she decried comeys release of information about the investigation i wonder if she and hillary clinton will be able to get

is not only a powerful democratic party lobbyist but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of saudi arabia no as tinfoilhat conspiracy theorist as it might sound that scenario is the absolute truth in john and tony podesta formed the podesta group and have used their bigwig partyinsider status to lobby and influence government policies while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest according to the march filing made in accordance with the foreign agents registration act of tony podesta is an active foreign agent of the saudi government with the center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court and acts as an officer of the saudi arabia account at this point the web of payforplay between the washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight for starters the podesta brothers lobbying firm receives every month from the saudi government which in no uncertain terms and despite a status as privileged us ally wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations john podesta previously served as president bill clintons chief of staff founded the think tank center for american progress which ohsocoincidentally touts the need to reframe saudi arabias hopelessly tarnished image counseled president obama and now chairs hillary clintons campaign tony podesta acts as a foreign agent for the kingdom of saudi arabia lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the kingdom while also contributing to and bundling for hillary clintons campaign think about that for a moment one brother uses the influence of money to both affect united states foreign policy and infuse the clinton campaign with cash while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities as the washington post reported months ago in july tony podestas lobbying efforts raised for the campaign and for the victory fund the saudis hired the podesta group in because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger raif badawi to ten years in prison and lashes for insulting islam alternet reported since then tony podestas fingerprints have been all over saudi arabias advocacy efforts in washington dc when saudi arabia executed the prominent nonviolent shia dissident sheikh nimr alnimr causing protests throughout the shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions the new york times noted that the podesta group provided the newspaper with a saudi commentator who defended the execution notably the saudis reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant usbacked coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict additionally tony podestas status as a registered foreign agent for saudi arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from april ironically revealed by wikileaks publishing of his brothers personal communiques in which former clinton foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director dennis cheng wrote to a small group of insiders hi all we do need to make a decision on this asap as our friends who happen to be registered with fara foreign agents registration act are already donating and raising i do want to push back a bit its my job i feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table both for primary and general and then dnc and state parties and how do we explain to people that well take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them that the foundation takes from foreign govts but we now wont either way we need to make a decision soon to which general counsel to the clinton campaign attorney marc elias replied all errors original and emphasis added responding to all on this i was not on the call this morning but i lean away from a bright line rule here it seems odd to say that someone who represents alberta canada cant give but a lobbyist for phillip morris can just as we vet lobbyists case by case i would do the same with fara while this may lead to a large number of fara registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban a total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eyerolling and ill will that it did for obama as the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaigns image with potentially controversial donors while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash becomes even more apparent as strategist and campaign manager robby mook responds where do we draw the line though elias suggests a particularly intricate solution if we do it case by case then it will be subjective we would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for in judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the united states its relationship to the state department during hillarys time as secretary and its relationship if any to the foundation in judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and hillarys past campaigns specifically put simply we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists except with a somewhat more stringent screen as a legal matter i am not saying we have to do this we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely im just offering this up as a middle ground mook eventually decides plainly marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions dont really get you anythingthat obama actually got judged more harshly as a result he convinced me soin a complete uturn im ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks are you guys ok with that all of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect despite increasing calls for the united states to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody saudi regime the us approved a stunning billion sale of smart bombs to the kingdom in november tony podestas specific contract with the governmentrun center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court which will earn million by years end does indeed suggest the infusion of a prosaudi message into the us media propaganda machine saudi arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in washington sunlight foundation spokesman josh stewart told the washington post that spans both what youd call the inside game which is lobbying and government relations and the outside game which is pr and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying that broader audience the american public has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughlycorrupt clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the saudis as well as the free thought project has repeatedly reported the evidence of collusion among the democratic national committee hillary clintons campaign and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable including no less than socalled journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet and yet at the center of

down richard nixon and now hillary clintons coverup of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very very long time when news broke that the fbi has renewed its investigation into hillary clintons emails it sent shockwaves throughout the political world but this time around we arent just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i havent heard anyone talking about this but if the fbi discovers that hillary clinton altered destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the fbi during the original investigation she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political career and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life i have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice yet but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice whoever knowingly alters destroys mutilates conceals covers up falsified or makes a false entry in any record document or tangible object with the intent to impede obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than years or both if hillary clinton is sent to prison for years that would essentially be for the rest of her life i have a feeling that the fbi is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in huma abedins emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before november th because according to the wall street journal there are approximately emails to search through as federal agents prepare to scour roughly emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of hillary clinton s email use the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee metadata found on the laptop used by former rep anthony weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin a close clinton aide suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter it will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated from the time ms abedin served with mrs clinton at the state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the clinton email probe of those emails an inside source told fox news that at least would be of interest to the investigation at this point fbi officials have not even begun searching through the emails because a search warrant has not been secured yet the following comes from cnn government lawyers havent yet approached abedins lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search sources earlier told cnn that those discussions had begun but the law enforcement officials now say they have not either way government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer the law enforcement officials said but the fbi is reportedly already searching a laptop that was coowned by anthony weiner and huma abedin and no warrant was necessary for that search because weiner is cooperating with the fbi many have been wondering why fbi director james comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big in addition comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the fbi the following is an excerpt from a daily mail article that was written by ed klein the author of a recently released new york times bestseller about the clintons entitled guilty as sin the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom so what happens next in the most likely scenario the fbi will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge hillary clinton before the election this means that we would go into november th with this scandal hanging over the clinton campaign and that would seem to be very good news for donald trump however it is possible that once the fbi starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against clinton are warranted and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day in the unlikely event that does happen we could actually see hillary clinton forced out of the race before november th once again this appears to be very unlikely at this point but it is still possible if clinton was forced to step aside the democrats would need to come up with a new nominee and that process would take time in an article later today on the most important news i will reveal who i believe that nominee would be in such a scenario the democrats would desperately need time to get their act together and so we could actually see barack obama attempt to delay or suspend the election the legality of such a move is highly questionable but barack obama has not allowed a little thing like the us constitution to stop him in the past this week is going to be exceedingly interesting that is for sure the craziest election in modern american history just keeps getting crazier and i have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead it sure seems ironic that anthony weiner is playing such a central role this late in the story and i cant wait to see what is in store for the season finale courtesy of michael snyder dont forget to

the perennial large battleground states of ohio florida iowa and north carolina plus georgia and in a change not seen in more than a generation he has seized pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin pennsylvania and michigan have not voted for a republican presidential candidate since and wisconsin since way back in it appears also that states the democrats thought were well and truly in the bag for them such as minnesota maine and virginia have stayed blue with only waferthin or very disappointing margins the nd congressional district of maine a state which divides its electoral votes along with nebraska has been called for the republicans for the first time in nearly years the last time any maine district voted for a gop presidential candidate was when george h w bush seized all four electoral votes there importantly too avowedly liberal states have seen significant turnouts for trump for example counts so far show that some of voters in connecticut and rhode island states with even more liberal media bias than the nation generally have opted for the racist sexist and homophobic republican candidate their votes ultimately did not change the electoral college map but it is heartening to know that even in the eye of the liberal storm plenty of people are happy to support trump this is despite them facing fierce rebukes and often enough violence if they make their views public the clown candidate has beaten more experienced republican challengers and now hillary clinton the most elitebacked candidate in the worlds political history as tonights results have shown plenty of trump voters in red and blue states alike have been forced to keep their beliefs quiet media airtime for protrump views and stories has been deliberately minimized and frequently demonized by the major networks mainstream journalists such as glenn thrush wolf blitzer jake tapper jessica valenti and brent budowsky have been caught collaborating with both the dnc and clinton campaign if you believe that these two groups are actually separate this only increases the esteem in which the emphatic resounding trump victory needs to be held and lets not forget the senate and house races after months of spineless gop cucks rushing to differentiate themselves from trump the donald has still carried them to victory in both houses of congress the white house senate and house of representatives are all in republican hands until at least the house midterms can you taste the very salty tears of the liberals and sjws yet every powerful vested interest not only supported hillary but did everything they could to ruin trump yes its happening did you see the last major hillary clinton rallies celebritiescumpolitical hacktivists chief among them lady gaga beyoncé jay z bruce springsteen bon jovi and katy perry all fell into clintons corner well before their final appearances for her excoriating anyone who had the gall to support donald trump even longterm republicans who betrayed trump like arnold schwarzenegger were attacked by celebrity sjws such as robert deniro after they joined the never trump ranks as if they were dangerous saboteurs the celebrity paranoia has been palpable for months hollywood that broad industry taking in not just film stars but also singers silver screen actors and comedians has become little more than an overpaid trade union for hillary clinton likewise every major american company that has come out for a candidate has come out for hillary plenty of neutral corporations have undoubtedly been funneling support to the clinton campaign behind the scenes as well prominent billionaires like george soros and warren buffett have done all they could to drag hillarys stumbling halfcorpse both literally and figuratively across the line whilst trump has been supported by a number of tenfigure businessmen these men are regularly attacked in the media they include the scapegoated but brave peter thiel and carl icahn and then theres the mainstream media countless studies have indicated that about of all journalists are liberal this overrepresentation is more salient still in the upper echelons of newsmen and women particularly prominent mastheads such as the new york times washington post and huffington post plus democratic tv surrogates like cnn and nbc the campaign has inflated this preexisting liberal bias one that plagued the two george w bush administrations but raged even more ferociously against donald trump over the last months all of these media elites have lambasted trump for over a year at the same time they give the paltriest coverage of the disgusting hillary podesta and dnc emails everything newsworthy on this front from the overwhelming presence of clinton foundation donors in hillarys secretary of state diary book to more recent revelations about john podestas involvement with satanic rituals has been brushed off the balcony by the wolf blitzers and chuck todds of the american mainstream media yet trump has triumphed nonetheless the new administration must crush the criminal democratic elites and clinton foundation with the rule of law will hillary now find herself stumbling into jail inasmuch as the clinton campaign the sjws and their big business and media enablers have been defeated in this years election they retain very welloiled and effective means for trying to undermine president trump once he takes office trumps first priority as commanderinchief must be to remove the bureaucratic apparatchiks preventing a full and frank investigation of the clinton foundation he also needs to clear the way for legal inquiries into the various criminal activities as uncovered by wikileaks perpetrated from within the dnc and hillary clintons campaign the department of justice in particular has engaged in all manner of skulduggery most notably when attorneygeneral loretta lynch had a private meeting with bill clinton during the most crucial time of the fbi investigation into hillarys emails additionally elements of the state department illegally informed hillary about new developments in that same case enough is enough its time to drain the swamp election night produced another curveball after weeks of calling donald trump a sore loser for him not saying if he would respect the final result hillary clinton refused to speak to her supporters and the american people it would seem that she only telephoned trump privately so whos the sore loser now last night we were witnesses to the greatest electoral seachange in americanand perhaps globalhistory we cannot

1.0,1.0,1244,2,0.0,0.09753691983122367,0,0,0.396,alain soral is an influential frenchswiss thinker author and filmmaker his beliefs are summarized as french third position basically a third party for those that reject the traditional left and right political views and there have been third position movements in many european countries over the past several decades major beliefs of sorals ideology include nationalism political sovereignty social conservatism antiglobalism antiimmigration antifeminism antibankster and a noninterventionist antiwar foreign policy a major slogan of third position is reconciliation between the labor left and the values righteconomic policy which values individual work and labor and social policy focused on nationalism and traditionalism early life alain soral was born in in southeastern france he attended a wellregarded private catholic school before enrolling in the distinguished national school of fine arts in paris founded in and later transferred to study under the philosopher and economist cornelius castoriadis a famous th century thinker castoriadis castoriadis favored autonomous societies that are selfaware of their autonomy and independence and believed societies should provide legitimacy for their laws and government actions historically this was often done through absolute monarchy by invoking religion and god with the monarch having a direct connection to the almighty what god has commanded is what we must institute with the law modern capitalist societies proved their legitimacy through circular tautology that is they claimed that capitalism was logical and just and therefore whatever a capitalistic society deemed profitable was therefore logical and just a just autonomous society was always questioning and challenging its laws but at the same time adhering to respecting and upholding the law castoriadis described modern society as a struggle between creative imaginary and capitalist imaginary the repetition of empty forms of conformism apathy irresponsibility and cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of rational mastery pseudorational pseudomastery of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption that is to say for nothing and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary the other road should be opened it is not at all laid out it can be opened only through a social and political awakening a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy that is to say of the will to freedom this would require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginary postuniversity soral loved books and knowledge studying radicals from throughout the political spectrum he was a dragueur de rue street pickup artist when the pua movement was virtually unknown he developed a skill at attracting young narcissistic valueless city girls and claimed to bed hundreds of women and published a book on game in his experiences with these women led him to develop strong antifeminist beliefs he developed a strong dislike for the french bobosbourgeois bohemians younger wealthy highly educated narcissistic hedonists interested in fashion and trends perhaps something like rich hipsters but less retro more fashionable and trendy he joined the french communist party motivated by his dislike of the bobos and his camaraderie with the working man the communist party along with the front national were among the few opponents of the creation of the eu soral studied the works of marx and other marxists before leaving to join the far right front national where he was a speechwriter for marie le pen he noted that both communists and front national members were strongly nationalistic and indeed many workers left the communist party to join fn around this time he became a strong critic of feminism and minority politics gay feminist and islamist or other racial multicultural groups after front national performed poorly in the elections he formed equality and reconciliation seeking to consolidate ideas on the left and right who believed in nationalism patriarchy anticommunism antiimmigration and antizionism er is an alternative news site with some tendencies to the american altright pronationalist and critical of modern culture and feminism he describes it as left for the workers and right for morals he is a boxer and since has coached boxing he records videos has a regular feature naming the cunt of the month and his works and website are very popular despite harsh attacks against him in the mainstream media summary of views trolling a feminist not much is available in english of soral and even english subtitles on his many videos are hard to find i have but a cursory understanding of french so i have relied on secondary sources and translations his major beliefs are antifeminism views feminism as not prowork as women have always worked but instead as antifamily and antimother discusses two classes of feminists freaks and bitches the real struggle is between rich and poor not man and woman who are naturally attracted to each other he has attacked womens magazines as altering the social conscience and relegating women to the status of objects stresses selfimprovement and virility in men anticapitalism and anticonsumerism opposed to valueless consumption and consumerism in favor of banksterfree economics and an end to the nanny state opposes desire society and the cult of celebrity antiimperialism opposed to the globalist empire and american imperialism attempting to spread its cultural ideological economic social views everywhere and to destroy all nationstates antizionism has attacked jewish lobbying and intervention in french affairs made statements criticizing the jewish people for being ostracized in societies around the world throughout history which earned him an immediate and harsh media blackout he makes a distinction between french jews and zionism saying that zionists are opposing the interests of france and french jews anticommunitarianism favors nationalism not communitarianism calls communitarianism a poison opposed to ethnic racial sexual islamist or feminist communitarianism which is opposed to morality and national standards opposes the public effeminate homo and transsexual society and laments the lack of strong male role models makes a strong distinction between homosexuality and the gay pride community movement which promotes drag queens parties vulgar parades and hypersexualization antivulgarity opposes vulgar language dress and speech especially in women has said he prefers publicly wearing the muslim veil to thong underwear would go crazy at a slutwalk critic of profanity and vulgarity proponent of morality and modesty islam feels the menace of islam is an artificially created and manipulated threat primitive islamic society is not a real threat to modern western states and capitalistic globalist interests manipulate the region to destroy the antiglobalist antifeminist culture of islam to foster animosity between social groups to possibly create a clash of civilizations or world war leading to a full globalist takeover and to loot mideast nations and that the fundamental values of moderate islam are perfectly compatible with french moderate catholic views antimodern culture and mainstream media opposed to the decline in western values and culture and the sorry state of mainstream media who has labeled him a pariah le neo masculinité many likeminded red pill men are turned off by the leftright politics in america the third position combines right views on nation morality and law with some left positions on social issues and economics i believe if both the left and right hate you you are probably doing something right the ideas

desperate to keep her share on twitter print this post earlier this week friday fox follies under the assumption the explosive and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich would be this weeks lede i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it thats when he got personal accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly watch as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal of which he is owner to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news if they are going to make a network that is going to be a postailesposttrump it will be around megyn kelly chris wallace and shep smith and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard said andrew tyndall a televisionnews consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr murdoch were not changing directionthat would be business suicide he said mr oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year and mr murdoch said were going to want bill to stay with us mr hannitys contract isnt up until ms kelly has forged close ties to mr murdochs sons particularly lachlan murdoch who is coexecutive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the situation said fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that by the daily beasts tim teeman imagine then her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praiseridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon vanity fair megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work pajiba and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now the stir note the grudging headlines because of kellys employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional leftwing context throughout her career to date the fword mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a rightfacing institution and not be percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for full disclosure i worked for the times of london a british rupert murdochowned newspaper for over years aside from the fact that when she tilts right she tends to tilt altright the biggest knock on kelly is that shes too hardedged marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee but kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy this makes her less attractive to other networks shes hoping to change that impression when she cohosts live with kelly ripa the kelly kelly show the morning after the election think of her as a designated hitter trying

very successfully to sexualize their youth seeking to cash in on her newfound fame as an unhinged sjw rose mcgowan launched the rose army a kind of personal cult that tries to hide the overt narcissism of its creator by supporting campaigns against domestic violence and female objectification full sjw mode is just a button away for her for instance she attacked gays for not being feminist enough and probably projecting her jealousy over not landing a significant acting role for an eternity claimed an xmen movie poster promoted violence against women so now comes the task of reconciling the new rose mcgowan with the old one whose selfobjectification is best described by this infamous photo with exboyfriend marilyn manson excuses excuses rose mcgowan has tried to gloss over her past history of selfobjectification and sexualization by saying she was merely a pawn of the patriarchy mcgowan is now even blaming her past personal feuds such as with a fellow charmed actress shannen doherty on patriarchy sexism and female objectification sadly this very public attentionseeking in which mcgowan wrote doherty an open letter comes at the same time that the latter is suffering from cancer but you know a girls gotta attentionwhore including when another girl she used to have catfights with is about to die rose mcgowan has a lot in common with pamela anderson ex playboy cover model anderson after an entire career made from taking her clothes off and otherwise selling her body as if she were competing for a championship has now come out against pornography she may not be bad for a gal nearing but her best years are a good years behind her i would wager that pamela anderson hit and spent the last several years in denial before she decided to lambaste an industry currently lauding nubile girls in their twenties and not her pornography addictions are bad but anderson showing these new colors in is nothing short of a joke andersons position can be summed up by the following two pictures time when she did not condemn pornography time when she condemns pornography previously a lot of attention has been paid to fat or unattractive girls being feminists these activists are nominally against the sexualization of women but appear to be driven primarily by envy and the need to diminish societys praise of attractive females whilst there is a lot of truth to this it only tells part of the story the rank opportunism of feminism is perhaps better explained by women who once made a career from selling their appearances and have subsequently turned on the industries whose financial teats they used to suckle and what better time to turn on these industries whether they be the pornography film or modeling markets than when your looks no longer allow you to actively participate in them this phenomenon runs parallel to female athletes both utilizing and complaining about their sexualization attractive tennis players like sabine lisicki and unattractive ones like serena williams have made careers out of wearing revealing oncourt clothing which is much more for show than practicality but when the chance presents itself lisicki and others have moaned like at this years wimbledon about how manufacturers designs make them show too much skin many of these girls may not have lost their attractiveness yet but they pick and choose when objectification is bad just like celebrities whose looks have abandoned them its not just famous people natasha devon many return of kings readers will remember natasha devon from her awful performance against milo yiannopoulos during a british sky news debate on fashion mannequins there seems to have been an eerie timing in devons transition from selfdescribed former model to sjw she founded a socalled body image education program in in her midtwenties i dont know about you but this seems to be the sort of age when nonfamous models in particular face the meat grinder due to competition from younger fresher girls as she hurtled towards natasha devon penned an article for cosmopolitan magazine on bulimia which morphed into a regular monthly column then came the selfesteem team devon created in frequently with government funding the selfesteem team has essentially applauded obesity britains number one health crisis and sought to reengineer what humans are programmed by evolution to find attractive devon along with anderson and mcgowan may chalk an antiobjectification epiphany down to age experience or something similarly convenient but the changes happened neither at the height of their selfsexualization careers nor during the prewall protracted slide always be on the look out for when exactly a woman took up feminist or general sjw activism when a woman complains about the objectification of women it usually means a she never had the goods to begin with b her goods werent enough to compete with other girls or c her goods are well and truly gone there is a delicious irony to option c as countless women will milk their looks until natureor a halfdecade of alcohol or drugfueled benderstakes them away feminism as projection it is par for the course in todays political climate that our enemies describe us as sad mommas boys who play out failed encounters with women through our beliefs of anyone roosh has faced this entirely baseless criticism the most all because our opponents have been unable to actually refute what he and return of kings say we need to turn this idea of projection against feminists even more than we have before modernday feminism is itself the domain of women seeking easy comforts from an ideology that explains away either their own faults or their most primal fears about a harsh uncertain world for women whose looks are now washedup feminism enables them to label objectification as wrong and soothe the crushing blows that come from no longer getting the attention they were used to rather than seeing these women as twisted and evil it is better to perceive the behavior for what it is desperation and the shocking realization that they are sexually irrelevant read more female danish athletes diminish their own

a lot about the lasting power of viagra that this is still the case when we have a couple of seventyyearolds on the ballot for an election lasting more than four years please call your doctor in last weeks newspaper there was a report on the tenth or eleventh woman i have lost track to come forward to say that donald trump made suggestive and inappropriate advances to her during a golf tournament that took place about ten years ago the woman in question is jessica drake who during her press conference announced that at the time of the tournament she was working in the the adult industry thats what people magazine calls porn for wicked pictures the th century fox of gang banging when the randy donald kissed and hugged her in his room trump was already in his pajamas when she knocked on his door together with two friends normally in the adult business when three porn stars knock on your hotel door its considered foreplay when trumps effusive greeting of miss drake did not lead to more snuggling let alone the suggestion to preview some of her work on the hotel television he offered her to satisfy his suite dreams drake again demurred saying that the next morning she needed to get back to los angeles for work by that point in her career she had already notched screen credits for extreme doggie and fornocopia i would mention other titles but as they say at the new york post this is a family newspaper that rejection prompted donald to offer jessica an early morning ride of shame on his trump airliner back to la which still didnt turn the trick then last week in the presence of her lawyer gloria allred the perry mason of many cases against bill cosby miss drake tearfully repeated in primetime her shock and dismay that mr trump had tried to take liberties with her reputation which after all includes the adult video news award for the best double penetration sex scene in her classic work fallen drake said she was coming forward now to stand in solidarity with the other women trump has manhandled although there were suggestions that her outing was timed to coincide with the launch of drakes new online store where devoted viewers can purchase such classics as her guide to bdsm for beginners among other titles normally scenes such as the one i am describing would be consigned to john oliver monty python or saturday night live but in the new normal of presidential politics even miss drake gets a respectful hearing on the issues for example the next day the huffington post reported woman says trump sexually assaulted her offered her for sex the deadpan new york times wrote ms drake who appeared saturday with the womens rights lawyer gloria allred said mr trump had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission the headline in new york magazine read adult actress jessica drake details trump assault blasts him for uncontrollable misogyny look i have no doubt that trump is a pig who routinely gropes and propositions women but since when does the press in a presidential election have to source its stories in the adult industry sadly the answer to this question dates to winter when bill and hillary clinton figured out that unless a presidential candidate has a sexual storyline few of the voters will pay much attention to their positions on nuclear disarmament or welfare reform during the super bowl the clintons appeared on a halftime special of minutes to deny jointly bill that allegation is false that he had ever had an affair with gennifer flowers who lived in little rock arkansas when bill was governor and often out jogging in this vaudeville performance hillary played the straight man adding you know im not sitting heresome little woman standing by my man like tammy wynette at least she didnt reference the eagles only in under oath in a sworn deposition did bill admit to having a year affair with ms flowers but neither her allegations in nor his lying about it cost him the election that year just the opposite clintons wanderlust might have won him sympathy among the voters no strangers to sexual boredom who found they had more in common with a softshell baptist bill than an uptight protestant george hw bush nor did clintons impeachment in for lying about his affair with monica lewinsky under oath in the paula jones case hurt his postpresidential career worth million or the electoral prospects of his wife in but it did turn sexuality into a mainstream presidential campaign issue which is one of the reasons why this years race seems only to be about sex no doubt the clintons do find some delicious irony in trumps groping charges as payback for what they view as the republican use of sexuality to impeach bill in and in for the gop plan to make his many adulterous affairs fair game for their campaign soundbites cut to an online image of the white house and over it a fading picture of bill smoking a cigar with the caption here we go again without the pageantloving casino operating donald trump as the republican nominee in hillary clinton could well have been vulnerable on the sexual front with bills mistresses steady fodder for negatives ads and the many allegations from his scorned lovers that hillary organized the slutshaming instead of the election turning on hillarys marriage to hugh hefners doppelgänger the storyline that has played best in the media is donalds secret life as a groper the press actually has given trump a pass for his adultery which produced all those wonderful children but zeroed in on his groping in part because he confessed to it on an nbc videotape and also becausethink of ratingsgropers belong in the same basket of deplorables as child abusers and others lurking on subways crowed elevators or near schoolyards best of all for the clintons politically anyway is that the charge of groping is impossible for trump to refute even denying it sounds sleazy and it colors all aspects of the campaign to wit the new york times headline when at gettysburg trump outlined his vision for america donald trump pledges to heal divisions and sue his accusers for its mudslinging i am sure the trump campaign has spent many long hours brainstorming how to tar hillary as a lesbian but even that innuendo has fallen flat despite the rumor mongering that shes in a boston marriage with her assistant huma abedin whose husband anthony weiner is otherwise distracted in high school chat rooms several of bills former lovers sally miller dolly kyle and flowers have tried to play up bills pillow talk that hillary prefers the nighttime company of women but none of these allegations have gone further than infowars or the supermarket press hillary hit man tells all nor have outofwedlock children a staple of the campaign as was chanted to grover cleveland ma ma where s my pa gotten much play in this years presidential race trump and his casino gumshoes have put considerable effort into tracking down the rumor that danney williams is bill clintons illegitimate son by a little rock prostitute named bobbie ann williams trump invited danney a sympathetic man to the third presidential debate as if to press on bill a scarlet letter despite williams looking very much like president bill the story got no more traction than did the news that malik obama the presidents shunned halfbrother is supporting trump he too got a debate invitation to sit in the box presumably marked shame also in the dustbin of history are the allegations that flowers aborted bills baby in and the whispering campaign a great political standby when proof is elusive that chelsea is the product of an affair between hillary and her then law firm colleague webb hubbell the williams and hubbell stories come with some convincing internet similarities at least in the photographs although in both cases politically this rumor milling whiplashed against trump as voters have only equated such tawdry allegations with his birther past something that has stuck as campaign mud technically birtherism doest directly involve sex although it lingers on its fringes as it speaks to barack obamas illegitimacy his foreign allegiances and possibly disputed paternity including the claim that frank marshall davis was actually obamas biological father another subterranean creed of trumpism again the documentary proof is a series of lookalike photographs as close as the internet gets to dna that davis was an american communist works well in the campaign as it suggests the origins of obamas political genetic code ironically for all his efforts at smear trump came out the loser in the debates when hillary nailed him to birtherism which has become a convenient code word for trumps racism misogyny and intolerance of immigrants especially muslims nor in response did trump have any luck in linking the birther movement to clintons campaign when according to donald consiglierejournalist sidney blumenthal delighted in the suggestion that barack was born in kenya instead the debate claim only made trump look disingenuous clinton got a pass on what her campaign may or may not have insinuated in and at this point no one cares but voters do remember trump as the imperial wizard of birtherism republicans can only blame themselves for wanting to divide the electorate in along lines of sexual preference or deviance although this strategy was based on hillary being the democratic nominee and anyone other than trump standing for the republicans had the gop nominee been carly fiorina jeb bush or john kasich clinton inc might well have been vulnerable to possible storylines about infidelity illegitimacy and rape cue up the paula jones description of bill during a business meeting exposing himself in a little rock hotel and settling her lawsuit for instead the republicans went with the polyamorous trump who in addition to three marriages has bragged on morning radio about his success with young women and who since has been leering at miss universe contestantsa bit like austin powers shall we shag now or shall we shag later with trumps resumé of creepy perversion you might have thought that the republicans would drop sexual misconduct from the electoral playbook instead they doubled down to make the case that both clintons if elected would turn the white house into a strip club not only did the clintons shrug off such innuendo but in response they said in effect if they did it would be to cater to the likes of players such as donald j trump leisure suit and open collar optional for the momentand i cant see anything changing in the last days of the campaignthe accepted wisdom of most front pages is that donald trump has groped as many women as tiger woods has watched pole dancing in vegas even the gallery of their women looks about the same conversely few voters seem to care that bill might have forced himself on several women or that hillary helped to cover up his brutality thats a narrative of the s which is perhaps the last time austin danger trump read the newspaper ive been frozen for years ive got to see if my bits and pieces are still working for most voters in names such as kathleen willey or juanita broaddrick are as lost in time as nan britton who just before the election bore a love child with then candidate senator warren harding britton and the child got republican hush money and a sad little house in asbury park new jersey after harding won she was invited to the white house but their affair so to speak was kept in the closet if you think about elections as political sitcoms in the kennedys had to run as rob and laura petrie on the dick van dyke show complete with twin beds long flannel pajamas and prudent kisses on the cheek to say goodnight even if the jfk reality show would make trump bill clinton and tiger look like apprentices at adultery come only something that resembles modern family and a desperatehousewives reality show can crack network primetime and who better to put on air than the clintons with their dallas like money communal sexuality and more illicit storylines than csi for more than twenty years bill and hillary have been bringing us seasons of lust affairs ididnothavesexwiththatwoman vince foster travelgate foundation slush funds basement servers commodity trading whitewater bosnian snipers paytoplay benghazi lost emails and the like and the ratings only continue to go up sure the apprentice was fun for a few episodes but the sameness of insulting young people grew tedious how is that supposed to compete with bill making a pass at huma while her husband goes to prison for airing his junk and chelsea finding out about her real father next on the clintons,0

greenfield daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam before long the same administration that declared the fighting in iraq over several times will claim victory over isis the timetable for its push against the islamic state appears to have less do with the victimized christians and yazidis who have been prevented from coming here as refugees in favor of syrian muslims than with the clinton presidential campaign like obamas declarations that the wars in afghanistan and iraq were over the announcement that isis has been defeated will be premature it is based on a profound misunderstanding and misreading of islamic terrorism long before its current string of defeats isis had begun evolving into another al qaeda a multinational alliance of jihadists scattered around the world bombing mosul isnt hard but try bombing marseille brussels or london there is no doubt that the ability of isis to temporarily establish a caliphate allowed it to build a network that could carry out terror attacks from new york to miami to nice to munich but it would be dangerous to assume that losing iraq and syria will stop isis isis doesnt matter the idea of isis does and the idea of isis is islamic supremacism the organization we think of isis has transformed and rebranded countless times even now our leaders vacillate between calling it isis isil or more childishly daesh while it dubs itself the islamic state we have been fighting it in one form or another for over a decade it would be unrealistically optimistic to assume that the war will end just as this old enemy has shown its ability to strike deep in our own cities the bigger error though is to think that we are fighting an organization we are fighting an idea that is not to contend as obama does that we can debate it to death it is not the sort of idea that argues with words but with bullets bombs and swords but neither does it just go away if you seize a city al qaeda in iraq not only survived the death of zarqawi but it became even more dangerous under baghdadi it would be risky to assume that isis will die with him instead it may very well grow into a new phase of al qaeda one that ties together some of the worlds deadliest islamic terror groups into a network that is decentralized enough that it will not suffer from al qaedas leadership fatigue the rise of islamic terrorism has been an incremental process in which new groups learn from the mistakes of the old and supersede them if isis does recede into a localized oblivion reemerging only on occasion to suicide bomb something or someone in baghdad then a deadlier and even more effective group is likely to take its place each group will move one step closer to realizing the caliphate to break the cycle we must confront the idea of the caliphate at the heart of islamic terrorism isis is not unislamic it is ruthlessly and uncompromisingly islamic in that unlike its predecessors in the muslim brotherhood and al qaeda it makes the fewest compromises to civilizational sensibilities its goals are the same as those of every islamic political organization including those dubbed moderate it seeks to restore and enforce an islamic system in every part of the muslim world before moving on to conquer and subjugate the nonmuslim world if this were merely some fringe belief held by a tiny minority of extremists then it could be bombed to pieces in some syrian or iraqi backwater but its the driving force of islam thats why it wont go away no amount of appeasement will banish it taking in more muslim settlers pressuring israel and letting the muslim brotherhood colonize our foreign policy wont do it weve tried it and it actually makes islamic terrorism much worse when the announcement is made the usual suspects will pat themselves on the back for having defeated isis by mobilizing a muslim coalition but it wasnt obama who mobilized a muslim coalition the coalition such as it was mobilized them obama provided useful support to islamic state sponsors of terror such as iran and turkey assorted islamic jihadists on the ground some blatantly associated with sunni and shiite terror groups in their internal jihadist conflict with isis over who will fight us the allies we are aiding today will be the ones bombing us tomorrow and that is why claiming credit for beating isis accomplishes nothing isis is an expression of an islamic impulse encoded in the koran islamic groups differ in the tactical expression of that impulse isis was nastier and uglier than most of the islamic terror groups we had dealt with before this though even it found its boko haram affiliate in nigeria occasionally a little too much to stomach if isis vanishes from the world stage islamic terrorism will be easier to dismiss or so the thinking goes the islamic state was better at viral videos than the media that tried to whitewash islamic terror it was hard to ignore but a scattering of islamic terror groups around the world will be forgotten by the public history suggests thats wishful thinking islamic terrorism has shown no signs of receding growing muslim populations both at home and in muslim settlements in the west and the increase in travel and communications the infrastructure of globalism spread it from the most backward to the most advanced parts of the world wealthy and unstable muslim countries rich in oil but poor in power finance its spread through mosques and guns these are the ingredients that give us isis or any other combination or letters that stands for islamic terror to do anything meaningful about it we would have to reverse the decline of the west islam originally spread into a vacuum created by civilizational decline civilizational decline is why it is rising once again an obscure local terror group eventually turned into isis by filling a power vacuum even as obama performs another touchdown dance some other group will be making that same journey its mission will be the familiar one of replacing our civilization with its own until we come to terms with this civilizational struggle we will go on fighting endless wars in the sand and coping with endless terror attacks in our own cities because we have failed to recognize the nature of the enemy we are not fighting an acronym whether its isis or isil we are fighting an islamic state this is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the west or to islam,1

commenting on major medias choice to give trump vastly more air time than other candidates it may not be good for america but its damn good for cbs thats the introduction to a powerful critique of the us media a new film screens in new york and los angeles this week called all governments lie truth deception and the spirit of if stone the website allgovernmentsliecom has screening dates a list of lies and a list of good journalists who expose lies the lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film but theres a good deal of overlap enough to give you a sense of what this project is about id have made various changes and additions to the film in particular im tired of all the focus on iraq this film touches on war lies since then but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence still this is a film that should be shown in cities homes and classrooms across the united states it includes and is driven by noam chomskys analysis of how the media system is rigged without those doing the rigging believing theyve done anything at all its a survey of skullduggery by corporate media its an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm and its an introduction to if stone it includes footage of a presentation of the annual izzy award which goes to journalists acting in stones tradition one of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the gulf of tonkin nonincident anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie and it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense that is had the north vietnamese really shot back at a us ship off their coast that would not have been any sort of legal much less moral justification for escalating a war id love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the black sea the red sea and every other part of the earth today but the gulf of tonkin lies about vietnamese aggression against the us ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the us role of global policeman someone had to make the lies transparent someone had to document that in fact the secretary of socalled defense and the president were lying sadly nobody did that in the first hours after the congressional committee hearings and that was all it took for congress to hand the president a war and it was decades before white house transcripts came out and before the national security agency confessed and additional years before former secretary robert mcnamara did yet those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew and they knew it because of if stone who just weeks after the nonincident published a fourpage edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about tonkin stones analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the red sea off yemen and in fact it is to yemen that stone immediately turned on page in the united nations including its us ambassador had recently condemned british attacks on yemen that britain defended as retaliatory president dwight eisenhower had also warned the french against retaliatory attacks on tunisia and president lyndon johnson even at the time of tonkin stone notes was warning greece and turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other stone who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks the league of nations covenant the kelloggbriand pact and the un charter the latter two are still theoretically in place for the us government the united states in vietnam stone goes on to show could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of vietnamese boats and indeed the us ships stone reports were in north vietnamese waters and were there to assist south vietnamese ships that were shelling two north vietnamese islands and in fact those ships had been supplied to south vietnam by the us military and the good old american tax payers stone did not have access to closed committee hearings but he hardly needed it he considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war and then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees he found their denials to be nondenials and nonsensical it made no sense that the us ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the south vietnamese ships stone didnt believe it stone also filled in the background information the united states had been supporting guerrilla attacks on north vietnam for years prior to the nonincident and stone raised numerous suspicions including the question of why the us ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the nonincident to not occur and the question of why in the world vietnam would take on the united states military something nobody could explain though eugene mccarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored missing from the film and website of all governments lie is if stones work on lies about the outbreak of the korean war weve learned more since he wrote it but seen little more insightful relevant or timely for our understanding of korea and the world today this entry was posted in general bookmark the permalink,0

written by jewish columnist sever plocker this piece confirmed that terrible crimes which jewish communists had committed under stalin we must not forget that some of greatest murderers of modern times were jewish plocker started out by saying he went on to make a number of startling confessions heres a particularly forlorn historical date almost years ago between the th and th of december in the midst of the bolshevik revolution and civil war lenin signed a decree calling for the establishment of the allrussian extraordinary commission for combating counterrevolution and sabotage also known as cheka within a short period of time cheka became the largest and cruelest state security organization its organizational structure was changed every few years as were its names from cheka to gpu later to nkvd and later to kgb we cannot know with certainty the number of deaths cheka was responsible for in its various manifestations but the number is surely at least million including victims of the forced collectivization the hunger large purges expulsions banishments executions and mass death at gulags whole population strata were eliminated independent farmers ethnic minorities

spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their spanish names in return british settlers in america brought women with them explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape and murder when its committed by immigrants thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled in brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing in a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack two held in attack on child austin americanstatesman texas july two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack daily mail online uk july needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegal alien gang rape at all by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place the second case only was rape because of the girls young age she was but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team similarly within a few months of one another in two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened this attack also had nothing to do with islam reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher our country will be zimbabwe but if all goes according to the democrats plan theyll get to be

what they do because it makes them happy in that way happiness is beyond a state of feeling it is a state of being now although you dont want to be obsessive about happiness and make your life revolve around attaining it there are few things you can do to live a more fulfilling life and improve the quality of your being and as its often the case with selfimprovement i believe that addressing the bad habits will lead to a healthier life than trying to gain the positives here are some ways you may be sabotaging your own happiness you are chasing it ill be happy once i finally the more you chase happiness the less you have of it and not only are people today chasing happiness theyre chasing all the wrong things in hopes that it will bring them everlasting joy money women and status may elevate your life but they cant be the source of happiness alone they will especially fail as being compensation for some void in your life that youre trying to fill also know that your mood will naturally fluctuate over time constantly obsessing over how you feel and getting stressed over your emotional state will not help you so rather than jumping from one thing to another in hopes that it will boost your mood or dull your pain focus on things that matter to you its far better to work on selfimprovement and enhancing the overall quality of your life than be wavered by feelings you dont have the basics taken care of good sleep is extremely underrated in our busy society it affects your mood testosterone level mental capacity and more prioritize sleep as much as you do with healthy diet and working out its often the basics that are overlooked ask yourself are you sleeping well its harder to tell than you think are you eating healthy are you keeping yourself fit are you getting enough sunlight do you ever take the time to connect with nature do you have a stable life do you have a purpose or a meaning i doubt most people have all of these basic needs checked off but im willing to bet that an improvement in even one area will significantly improve a persons mood and well being you concern yourself with things you cant control no something bad is happening in the world and i cant do jack shit about it time to complain about it on the internet the more you sweat over issues which you can take no practical action over the more helpless you feel and the more unhappy you will be of course being able to tell the difference between what you can control and what you cant is an art in itself that you need to master through experience one thing im personally doing to lower stress is to reduce my news consumption and be less concerned with events around the world that are irrelevant to my personal life ill read enough to get a general awareness of whats happening around the world but i refuse to be emotionally invested in things i have no control over you lack intimacy and deep human connection if you dont have any friends to be vulnerable with you didnt have any to begin with i would argue that this is one of the biggest if not the biggest factor in causing anxiety depression and general unhappiness in the modern world humans are social creatures and we need to bond with others and beyond simply spending time with people to chat and drink deeper connection needs to be made with people the quality matters much more than the quantity in todays societyespecially in north americait seems people have all become superficial and afraid of intimacy whether it be for friendship or romance without opening up your true self due to the fear of being rejected or ridiculed all the relationships you have with others will not be genuine and it will not be fulfilling you are not living in the present reality you may be conscious but are you aware if you live in the past or the future you lose touch with the present reality that disconnection will cause longing which can only lead to dissatisfaction and loss of joy the lure of nostalgia and daydreaming of a better life or an improved world is actually quite insidious because of how intoxicating it is when your mind drifts to imagining a pleasurable experience or a more exciting life you are tricked into thinking that the longing is happiness itself sort of like how mirages work on the contrary studies have actually shown that you are actually happier and more productive when you focus on what youre doing right now even if the task is boring so stick to the reality and forget about your fantasies either make things happen or accept that youre just wasting your time and energy on wishful thinking you engage in junk activities im happy im happy im happy just as there are junk foods there are junk activities that may feel pleasurable at the time but dissatisfying and even harmful in the longrun ask yourself do you really need entertainment ive squandered my youth by immersing myself in long hours of digital entertainment day after day i barely even noticed that i was unhappy the whole time because i was so sedated and what did i even get out of them those were several hours everyday that i could have spent reading working out learning new skills meeting new people and experiencing the world the fact is giving up on entertainment has no negative impact on your level of happiness sure you might miss them when theyre suddenly gone but overall as long as you find more valuable things to do your life can only get better when you ditch them learn to enjoy things that give you value rather than seeking enjoyment in things without value conclusion unlike what many people today say no one deserves happiness thats something youll have to earn ill go as far as to say that happinessas defined by modern standardsisnt even necessary and hard to come by for certain individuals everyone has their own path towards living life to his unique potential and there is no universal rule that applies to all so while i havent really listed anything specific for the reader to strive towards i hope i laid out some pitfalls that you can avoid in your journey nov corey savage,0

environments not subject to the protections of tenure the first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students shares dr anthony jhall is a professor of globalization studies at the in alberta canada professor hall is the editorinchief of the american herald tribune he is author of several books including a twovolume publishing project at mcgillqueens university press entitled the bowl with one spoon american empire and the fourth world the bowl with one spoon part i mcgillqueens native and northern earth into property colonization decolonization and capitalism the bowl with one spoon part ii mcgillqueens native and northern series the part ii edition was recently selected by the uk independent as one of the best books of the journal of the american library association called earth into property a scholarly tour de force the books aim to set the catastrophe and post wars in the context of global history since dr hall has been suspended and harshly pulled from his classroom in midterm without any process of arbitration namely for having expressed his viewpoints on israeli crimes calling for an open debate on the holocaust and despite being promoted to a full professor rank through a process of peer review in an exclusive interview with khameneiir professor hall elaborates on how academic freedom is perceived and practiced in the west ayatollah khamenei has stated that genuine freedom of thought will help the country to progress in the absence of a free intellectual atmosphere there can be no opportunity for growth how do you as a professor perceive it i reflected very selfconsciously on the prospects of contributing to the progress of my country canada when i opted in the mid to late s to go to graduate school at the university of toronto with the great canadian historian jms careless as my phd supervisor i made a commitment to study the history of colonial relations with the first nations of canada my course of study took me in to my first appointment in the native studies department at the university of sudbury the university of sudbury was in those years a jesuitrun entity it formed the institutional seed from which the secular laurentian university would emerge in the decades prior to my appointment there for the next two decades i was able to work from my academic bases in sudbury and then in lethbridge alberta beginning in at the invitation of the leroy little bear the chair of the department of native american studies i thus moved to the resourcerich province of alberta once again i was motivated to make the transition in my professional work with the hope my i could contribute constructively to the progress of our country from an academic base in western canada in my years as a young professor i took an active part in four first nationsfirst ministers conferences that took place in ottawa between and the purpose of these conferences was to negotiate a constitutional amendment to give greater definition to the phrase the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of canada are hereby recognized and affirmed section constitution act more the bnai brith and the history of the mounting assault on academic freedom in canadian universities creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere section was part of the text of the instrument facilitating the movement of authority over canadas constitutional structure from the british imperial mother country to the domestic institutions of canadian federalism the culmination of my contributions to the formulation of a madeincanada version of the canadian constitution involved my opposition between and to what became known as the meech lake accord if this political deal between canadas first ministers had become constitutional law the first nations of canada would have been excluded from a very powerful legal definition of canadas fundamental characteristic in academic essays in the mainstream media and in presentations to various legislative committees i contributed to public awareness of the negative implications of the meech lake accord for fairminded canadians supportive of existing aboriginal and treaty rights more specifically i contributed to the strength of the platform from which an ojicree parliamentarian by the name of elijah harper used his veto power in the manitoba legislature to block the ratification of the meech lake accord because of elijah harpers actions the meech lake accord did not become part of canadas supreme law i was able to contribute to discourse crucial to the progress of canada until about the year between and i had to adjust my work away from the activities of the department of native american studies towards a field of my own making globalization studies i prepared two academic volumes to lay the academic foundation and methodological framework for my transition to a new academic role the core focus of my emphasis on globalization studies was indigenous peoples in encounter with colonialism globally from until the present it is in this context and with the encouragement of my very accomplished student joshua blakeney that i began to shift focus towards the treatment of palestinian and other arab peoples in the region of greater israel eretz israel it was joshua who also led me to my first interactions with iranian journalists resulting in my participation in the new horizon conference of the autumn of as i have described in writing elsewhere this episode proved to make a major positive impact on me due to the intervention of my colleague the mohawk activist splitting the sky i also began to see the events of as a major factor in the shaping of the global geopolitics in the twentyfirst century my quest for new academic turf at the has sometimes been bumpy and contested certainly many major obstacles were put in the way of my promotion to full professor eventually my academic peers were allowed to make their input into the promotion process apart from the artificial blockages thrown up by my university administration in after what i took to be my obtaining a position of intellectual and professional security as a senior faculty member i resolved that henceforth i would pursue difficult lines of research and publication i made this decision with an understanding that less secure younger colleagues might eschew such a course of action i have made no secret of the fact that i see the recent surrender of the high ground of academic freedom by the members of the administration of the as an indicator that canada is on a downwards spiral it seems to me there is a move a foot to sabotage the intellectual freedom of our universities if academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure the first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students they will have to deal with the fact that the treatment visited on me indicates it has become dangerous to ask pointed questions which might produce answers embarrassing to power our country canada cannot progress to higher levels of discourse and achievement under these repressive conditions ayatollah khamenei believes exchanging viewpoints and opinions are in the nature of academic work how is this principle practiced at lethbridge university i agree that exchanging viewpoints and opinions is a central aspect of academic work within universities and between universities i found that there was a good deal of openness to the exchange of information and ideas with colleagues media and public officials in the years between and when the core of my academic work revolved around the history of canadafirst nations relations unfortunately i would have to say that the obstacles to the exchange of information and ideas began to mount significantly after when i began to question the official narrative of what happened on who really did what to whom during the initiating events of what soon became known as the global war on terror as i began to become skeptical of the official narrative i noticed more and more inclination on the part of colleagues to distance themselves from the subjects that captured my professional interest to put it bluntly i suppose it became clear to me that for a number of reasons it was not a good career move for younger colleagues to show interest in the subject of specifically and false flag terrorism more generally as i began to look more deeply into the existing research on i was simultaneously drawn to the subject of war crimes and international law my collaboration with splitting the sky became more intense when we went to work to organize in response to the decision of the former us president george w bush to give a talk in calgary in as his first public engagement as theoretically a regular civilian citizen our collective action in calgary in the spring of led to a trial that we dubbed splitting the sky versus george w bush although i had not yet associated the lies and crimes of with israel first protagonists i ran into my first zionist pushback for my studies when i presented my essay should george w bush be arrested in calgary alberta to be tried for international crimes i originally presented the paper at an invited talk at the university of winnipeg my essay eventually ended up as an exhibit in the litigation that we referred to as splitting the sky versus george w bush our stance was that the former us president should have been arrested in canada for being a crediblyaccused war criminal we were far from alone in bringing forward evidence that bush had violated many international covenants and conventions against for instance prohibited torture not only had he arguably violated international law but it seemed the former us president had violated canadas own crimes against humanity and war crimes act the legislation had passed through parliament with the view that canada should not become a haven for war criminals in pursuing this line of analysis i faced my first allegations that somehow my academic inquiry was antisemitic as i worked on this subject one that i integrated into my pedagogy it became clear to me that we have never seen anything but victors justice when it comes to the enforcement of international law against those that commit war crimes crimes against humanity crimes against the peace and crimes against democracy it seems that only those on the losing side of military conflicts are ever brought to justice those on the winning side the stronger side are invariably held to be above the law this line of scholarly investigation did result in various channels of academic exchange opening up for me with colleagues in my own university and other universities the most fruitful collaboration to develop however was that with dr kevin barrett who had lost his academic position at the university of wisconsin for incorporating related subjects into his research and pedagogy for sure i should not be made to feel so alone in the academy when it comes to the study of the most transformative event of the twentyfirst century in my view the academic institutions in north america and europe have failed abysmally in the study of false flag terrorism starting with the events of i am particularly appalled by how this failure on the part of our institutions of higher learning has contributed to the rise of islamophobia as the necessary psychological condition giving license to those promoting the invasions of muslimmajority countries in a meeting with president rouhani and his cabinet the leader of the islamic revolution said when it comes to caricatures insulting the sanctities of islam the west suddenly becomes an advocates of freedom and the freedom of expression however when it comes to the holocaust there is no freedom of expression why do you think we witness such double standards a gross display of double standards plagues the ethnocentric way freedom is being defined in the socalled west the psychological operations attending the we are charlie hebdo ceremonies on paris in early epitomized the hypocrisy the whole essence of this strange event in the city of lights seemed to signal that freedom of speech and expression in the west is virtually limitless when it comes to demeaning through cartoons of prophet mohammed as well as other sacred symbols of islamic religion the other side of the same coin are the many prohibitions imposed on for instance the french comedian mbala mbala dieudonné dieudonné was barred from entering canada for his efforts to make humor of the paranoid state of affairs attending any public references to jews jewish institutions or the activities of israel these days one of my discoveries through this period of crisis is the fact that the thought police agents in the bnai brith equate my call for open debate on the holocaust and indeed open debate on all subjects as the equivalent of socalled holocaust denial how many of my colleagues at the and in other universities have bent before the harsh intimidation how many have made themselves proponents of shutting down open debate and allowing censorship from outside the academy to regulate our research teaching and publication there is a controversial quote from ayatollah khamenei in which he says may god curse all those who put an end to political thoughts work and endeavor in universities whats your take on that how essential do you think such a perspective is for the academia i agree wholeheartedly with the supreme leaders observation one of the great gifts of the creator to humans is the gift of reason and rationality our application of reason and rationality to our understanding of society will inevitably contribute to political thought work and endeavor this type of applied reason should be especially vital in the work of universities where the highest level of political conception should be able to find expression elaboration and receptiveness indeed we need to make ourselves expert in universities at making safe places for the development of political discourse god curse us in the universities if we cannot be the home for vibrant political discourse,0

court november and currently chairman representative godshall is allowing three more opt out bills to become sine die this session which should amount to an impeachable offense for denying consumers their inherent and indefeasible rights especially of redress to government and also according to the pennsylvania constitution i contend probably nothing encapsulates and explains the emfrfr controversy or conundrum if you may from a scientific viewpoint than the page report europaem emf guideline for the prevention diagnosis and treatment of emfrelated health problems and illnesses which is a spanish language document and found online at httpslistasumessympaarcanunciosmsghtml this report cites published scientific references which leaves frompovich to question why the pa pucand peco in particularare so daft in proffering that there is no updated science other than the s era safety thermal science regarding microwave electromagnetic energies based in ancient radar studies the microwave industry always trots out as proof of safety those safety studies originated in germany during world war ii are totally outmoded but remain the present federal communications commissions rules regarding safety of cell phones and ami smart meters it is now how come s microwave technology science is being applied as the gold standard or scientific criterion to meters that will become the key intelligence gathering technology for the internet of things frompovich has to question the credibility factor of both peco and the pa puc for depending upon science in todays technology world of wheres the science later than the s please may i have those studies peco supplied to the pa puc frompovich therefore respectfully suggests that the pa puc study the aboveaforementioned european reports with medical and ehs health professionals who are qualified to explain the diagnostics and varied modalities discussed in order to issue updated regulations affecting ami smart meters and their continuous rfremf healthdamaging electromagnetics plus their fireandexplosionprone proclivities and occurrences which definitely was not the case for all the decades utilities used safe and efficient analog meters children are the most vulnerable to emf radiation and therefore i introduce exhibit u why children absorb more microwave radiation than adults the consequences and exhibit u american academy of pediatrics august letter urging the food and drug administration commissioner the federal communications commission and others to advise the public about specific absorption rates sars regarding emfrf exposures also i want to apprise every one of the fact that electromagnetic sensitivity ehs is a growing problem and according to recently reported statistics in the peer reviewed journal ecopsychology professor pamela reed gibson states the following of the usa population of the swedish population of the danish population and of the german population are ehs compromised see exhibit v however other sources claim that as much as of the entire worlds population is affected just as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for yearsnow referred to as sick building syndrome or multiple chemical sensitivity mcsso too is ehs now being recognized by many including the world health organization i introduce exhibit w electrohypersensitivity a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment printout available here httpsdocsgooglecomvieweravpidforumssrcidmdgxodkwotknjuotuodqwntybmtuntizmdamtqxntynzintcbtvrzdgfeounbuufkataumqebdji as exhibit x i introduce a study no one can refute a review on electromagnetic fields emfs and the reproductive system which outlines science the microwave industry peco and all utilities utilizing ami smart meters plus public utility commissions across the usa need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics from dirty electricity pulsed by ami sms onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with ami smart meters before i include my previously submitted testimony i find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be frompovichs obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt especially in light of the ada amendments act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not since the adaaa provides frompovich with disability rights and protections which peco and the pa puc must abide by furthermore it should be the indisputable duty of peco and all pennsylvania utility companies but more specifically that of the pa public utility commissions stated mission for being to provide safe and nonradiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with certainty which ami smart meters fail on numerous levels especially with their proclivity for hot sockets fires and explosions emfrf constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as times a day no medicalscientific testing has proved ami smart meters emfs safety regarding nonthermal adverse health effects that i know of wheres the science therefore frompovich should not be forced to allow a provenfireprone ami smart meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high rfr pulses every fifteen seconds just to add more salt to the wound as they would say there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the ami smart meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the internet of things or that information will be shared with unknown third partiesfor whatever reasonsand for which frompovich does not approve nor give her permission to peco the pa puc or any government agencies or agents therefore frompovich feels her privacy as well as her home and personal physiology will be subjected to unlawful unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and specifically without proper legal processes eg courtissued warrants in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the twoway zigbee radio transmitter system of ami sms and all smart appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the internet of things the times frompovich makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no ones business but her own ive been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively including technologies since the late s during my career i was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several states legislaturelegislative hearings on health issues for numerous years i was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet nutrition epigenetics and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles i am in my th year thank god since the early s when i almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life ive been immersed in whats called the holistic lifestyle ive beaten the odds including being a breast cancer survivor using holistic healthcare modalities for the record of us adults and of us children used whats referred to as cam in per nih statistics complementary and alternative medicinecam as its called is popular throughout the world while in the us there is the national center for complementary and integrative health at the national institutes of health however the allopathic paradigm considers it quite frankly a pain in its professional butt since cam has become the go to healthcare system when allopathy fails one therefore i expect that i probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers wifi smart gadgets and in particular ami smart meters which are being bullyforced onto electric natural gas and municipal water utility customers most state legislators the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health fortunately i am not one of those people thus my refusing an ami smart meter on my house but first i think you ought to know some of my background im a wellinformed plus over years published consumer health researcher advocateactivist journalist and author that i should be taken seriously i offer some of my professional background retired practicing natural nutritionist former registered lobbyist with the us congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues executive director for the national coalition for alternatives in nutrition and healthcare canah for five years and as such presented fdasolicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its ota report otah ntis pb unconventional cancer treatments expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the us food and drug administration the first government relations specialist for the life extension foundation who set up lefs government relations department a published journalist author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on amazoncom and my book eat to beat disease foods medicinal qualities additionally i wrote and produced two tv shows one called turn off the violence was nominated for a telly award that hourlong show was instrumental in securing the giraffe award given to persons who stick out their necks for the common good the recipient was george mason university staff member connie kirkland who founded a hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted oncampus nonviolence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence what ive shared is much less than half of my background more would take too much of your time however i feel compelled to ask how many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues furthermore i want to underscore upfront that if i were a habitual drug addict rather than an informed concerned healthconscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health i probably would be welcomed with open arms plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help because i am opposing faulty and healthdamaging rfemf science plus vestedinterest snooping surveillance and customer data marketing agendas using ami smart meters i am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full that leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness isnt there something radically wrong with such a construct especially in the usa if i have to do that attorney ward smiths interrogatory requesting frompovichs cancer health records quite frankly leaves everyone with whom ive shared that fact totally aghast and amazed why because frompovichs medical records are her personal information protected under hippa and i must protect them furthermore since the puc administrative law court hearing is of public record frompovich does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings as that is her fundamental right i respectfully bring to this

condition most human beings experience themselves as egos trapped inside their own mindspace observing a world which seems to be out there on the other side of their skulls as a result the normal human state is one of aloneness were always onlookers rather than participants we can communicate with other people by speaking writing or gesturing but they will never be able to truly know us or to share our thoughts and feelings our inner being will always be sealed off from them egoseparation also creates a sense of incompleteness because were separate from the world were like fragments which have broken off from the whole and so feel a sense of insufficiency there s a kind of hole inside us which we spend most of our lives trying to fill but very rarely manage to like cats who were taken away from their mother at birth and who are always hankering for affection and attention to try to compensate for a sense of lack bornagain christians mean something close to this when they say that there is a godshaped hole inside us although in my view traditional religion cant fill the hole either only provide the same ultimately incomplete consolation as wealth or success as a result of this aloneness and incompleteness we dont feel completely at home in the world were not completely rooted here and so feel somehow adrift as if we dont fully belong like people who have travelled around the world so much that they no longer feel at home anywhere whereas traditional indigenous peoples seem to perceive the world as a benign and benevolent place to us it seems indifferent and even vaguely malevolent in addition our egoisolation generates a basic sense of insecurity and insignificance our own ego is so tiny and so flimsy in the face of the enormous world out there like a tiny wooden beach shack at the edge of a vast ocean we feel dwarfed by the sheer weight of the phenomena and events taking place out there how can we possibly have any significance in relation to them how can this fragile entity inside our heads stand up to the might of the world the wider effects of separateness however the effects of this separateness reach far beyond the individual in fact i would go so far as to say that the sense of separateness is the root cause of the constant conflict warfare and oppression which have blighted human history the human sense of incompleteness generates a craving for possessions power and status as a way of trying to complete ourselves and compensate for our inner discord we try to complete ourselves and make ourselves significant by gaining power over other people or by collecting wealth and possessions this desire for wealth and power is the root cause of warfare and oppression too coupled with the reduced empathy which separateness causes the separate self walls us off from other human beings makes it difficult for us to feel with them and to experience the world from their perspective this makes it possible for us to be violent and cruel to other people since we cant sense the suffering we cause them so we oppress and exploit them in the service of our own desires oppress women members of lower classes or castes different races so that we can gain more power status and wealth the sense of separateness is also the root cause of our abuse of the environment it means that we experience a sense of otherness to nature and that we cant sense its aliveness and as a result we dont feel any qualms about exploiting and abusing it why separateness i wouldnt exactly say that separateness is an illusion as many nonduality teachers would not an illusion but an aberration something which exists but shouldnt children dont experience separateness they exist in a state of natural relatedness to the world this is one of the reasons why childhood is so wonderful because the child feels connected to everything around them in a participatory flow with all experience with no in here or out there there are also many other peoples in the world who even as adults dont exist in a state of separateness most of the world s indigenous peoples dont see themselves as separate to their environment they feel a strong sense of connection to nature an awareness that they are a part of the web of creation and one which is no more important than any other as tim ingold writes of the batek negritos of malaysia for example they see themselves as involved in an intimate relationship of interdependence with the plants animals and hala spirits including the deities which inhabit their world or as the cherokee indian scholar rebecca adamson points out for indigenous peoples the environment is perceived as a sensate conscious entity suffused with spiritual powers through which the human understanding is only realised in perfect humility before the sacred whole the hopi use the term novoitti for the concept of living in harmony with nature while the tlingit also of north america call it shogan the anthropologist lucien levybruhl believed that essential characteristic of native peoples was that the limits of their individuality are variable and illdefined he noted that rather than existing as selfsufficient individual entities indigenous peoples sense of identity was bound up with their community and their land he cites reports of native peoples who used the word i when speaking of their group and others who see their land as an extension of their self so that being forced away from their land would be tantamount to death this is why native peoples are often prepared to commit suicide rather than leave their lands the naming practices of certain peoples suggest this too for us a name is a permanent label which defines our individuality and autonomy but australian aborigines for example do not have fixed names which they keep throughout their lives their names regularly change and include those of other members of their tribe other native peoples use tekonyms terms which describe the relationship between two people instead of personal or kinship names the sense of separateness seems to be a quirk of our psychological development for us it slowly develops as we move into adolescence becoming firmly established in our late teens the ego develops as a structure creating a sense of innerness and walling us off witness the massive change which occurs when a child enters adolescence especially with boys the freshness and joy of childhood gives way to dullness and confusion after being a part of the glorious flow of experience were suddenly outside the world alone inside our own mental space this is why adolescents have such a strong need for belonging their new sense of separation makes them feel so vulnerable that they need to reinforce their identity by being a part of groups or gangs or by following fashions more bleakly this is also why most murders are committed by young men in response to perceived slights or insults with their new fragile sense of identity young men are liable to take offence at any kind of trivial affront making them feel belittled and creating an instant desire to take revenge and regain their lost status i remember this transition clearly from my own adolescence after a carefree childhood i suddenly felt locked inside myself alone with thoughts and feelings which no one else would ever be able to experience along with that i felt an acute selfconsciousness i was aware of every movement i made and every word i spoke so that i couldnt do anything naturally anymore i felt exposed when i walked down the street aware that people could have been looking at me from their windows as they grow into adulthood most people deal with the fragility and vulnerability of the self by taking on roles and attachments they take on the roles of their jobs attach themselves to certain beliefs strengthening their identity with labels such as socialists atheists or muslims or attach themselves to ambitions to knowledge theyve accumulated to their selfimage as important or powerful people or emotionally attach themselves to other people these roles and attachments become the scaffolding of the ego propping it up and at the same time they reinforce separation making the individual walled off awakening from the sleep of separateness however no matter how far into separateness we fall in a sense its never more than superficial no matter how strong the ego becomes its never more than a construct everyone experiences moments when separateness temporarily fades and we become part of the unity again these are what i refer to as awakening experiences they frequently occur when were walking amongst natural surroundings when were dancing or running during or after sex listening to or playing music in these situations the normal chattering of the ego which is the normal fuel of the ego maintaining it as a structure becomes quiet leading to a softening of its boundaries separateness dissolves and were afloat on the ocean of being again immersed in the glorious isness and aliveness of the world tellingly in these moments there is always an identity shift we feel that weve become someone else a deeper more grounded self which seems more authentically you the egoself we identified with before seems like an imposter a limited and shallow trickster who somehow deluded us into thinking it was our identity there are also many cases of extreme loss or intense turmoil when all of the egos building blocks its roles and attachments are broken away a person might be diagnosed with cancer and told they only have a few months left to live an alcoholic might reach rock bottom and be on the point of suicide a person might become seriously disabled through injury or illness or they might suffer from the trauma of bereavement depression the destruction of hopes and beliefs and so on in most cases these forms of loss simply bring sadness and suffering but for a minority of individuals they can trigger a spiritual awakening with all its scaffolding broken down the normal egoself dissolves away and our deeper truer self emerges in its place like a butterfly from a caterpillar the person feels reborn like a different person inhabiting the same body with a new sense of meaning and connection in all of these experiences there is a sense of coming home back to our original oneness the harmony which both as an individual and as a species we fell away from it was always there it is always here its just that our separate selves deluded us into thinking we were asleep steve taylor holds a phd in

years ago gait is a married mother of five and longterm american resident in britain her support of the prolife movement is driven by thankfulness and praise for life and her christian faith witnessing abortions heavy toll on the living and dead gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing subtle and working entirely with symbolism these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion rather they mourn in color symbol and tone with single shoes broken cord dead flowers and other lonely and broken things troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x when a friend first visited gaits studio he was struck by her abortion paintings confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child he wrote i realize your work comes from a place of great love for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child it happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby five years to the day father x remembers every detail their conversation grew into a joint effort culminating in a book troubadours sailing hibiscus seas meditations on post abortion trauma father x wanted to remain anonymous as a placesetter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion he wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of gaits paintings in this book which have also been shown together in art exhibits time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion gait claims rather the past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence guilt and remorse has not abated you can see that in the words of father x which run the gamut of human emotions on abortion shoe pot and crossesfrom troubadours sailing hibiscus seas jonah of nineveh features an upended single rose with red cords and funereal foliage flowers are already in the birth position head down and waiting to be born torn and shroudlike ribbons hang across the painting spirals represent a childs dna helix and the veil of the temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation father x makes an analogy between jonah fleeing parental responsibility and eventual redemption then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness it was her wedding dress my sea green empress this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives she was full of fear in some of these works hammers incongruently hang with flowers they are bloody or blackened some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose father x interprets these tools as decision markers to either build or tear down in hammer of decision it belongs to thor the war god infested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction wagner the olympics sperm races thomas moore and valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author either the carpenters hammer of wisdom or thors tool of chaos will be chosen by expectant parents hammer suspended troubadours runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities this includes moonlighting for angels celestial games interstellar windjammers and a baby steamer sailing on childrens seas among other delightful prospects lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their limbos father x occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters these are not theological statements but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion in gaits pink rose and stardust we see empty fields withered plants and other tokens father x takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children he places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles which is reflected in the painting children are disfigured or missing eyes or arms and singing in low mournful tones so as not to disturb their parents music is intense equivalent to the sound created by hildegard von bingen a thcentury nun and composer troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x references to mary as a mother are common as well as other scriptural allusions all babies jump for jesus in the womb or in its sack of nibbling yoke writes father x elizabeths child john leapt for joy just as his ancestor david did before the ark of the covenant he continues gait addresses the human embryo finding biblical ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages her abbey target beginning has a crosshair target which is interpreted spiritually the first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread the bread on fire with the holy spirit the same stage of development as the child in marys womb when she arrived at her cousin elizabeths house postabort guilt isnt rationalized or downplayed but emotionally reacted to in art and word father x describes bats as whirling about in circles at the pitiful sound the aborted children make because they are tuned to such distressing signals this contrasts with many parents who are still stone deaf to such mournful sounds at another point fatherx imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus a roar of unwanted thoughts troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x father x elaborates on what gait hints in her paintings the injustice and evil of abortion he cites a world built on slavery before christs advent and the works of such men as william wilberforce and john brown in furthering christs gospel of justice and peace all this is contrasted to abortion throughout ruminating on gaits palms of our lord father x claims the face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion palms is murky with a single red hand print to look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the tarot of ruins he continues suicide advances this dark theme where gait and father x criticize the death industry and its euphemistically named clinics he takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings a caricature of a woman who made a mistake who got herself in trouble who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart but all isnt baleful and sad here in cloud children father x muses on paper dolls in gaits paintings with this lovely thought where children go is a mystery some say they take their daytime rest in christs tomb in jerusalem and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled star ships troubadours sailing hibiscus seas is a work of meditation grief counseling poetry social commentary and visual art father x may not reveal his identity here but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child gait and father x describe their efforts as a silent prayer of witness for all the ghost families those phantoms of sorrows who will never laugh or cry together as a family because of an abortion they hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way judith gait is a graduate of california college of arts and crafts

the decline worthless and bachelor pad economics his newest book is the black mans guide out of poverty he also runs the advisory asshole consulting you can read his daily rantings at his blog captain capitalism november masculinity buzz aldrin and neil armstrong are household names because they were the first men to land on the moon and while neil is perhaps the moreremembered of the two because he was technically the first to land on the moon buzz is just as remembered because of his unique name while i bet most of you dont know who the third guy was but technicalities of who landed where first and who had cool names aside buzz aldrin will forever be one of the worlds greatest historical figures because of his unrivaled accomplishments and will die a better man than the vast majority of us but did you know buzz aldrin was an alcoholic and after retiring he fell into a severe depression and after his divorce his days consisted of drinking alone in his apartment fetching kfc and booze until he entered rehab its a hard fact to believe where a man who seems to have everything fame a superaccomplished career and least of all the titaniumstrong professionalism and selfdiscipline to become an astronaut yet he ends up down depressed drunk and perhaps even suicidal like any other ordinary piece of trailer trash but while it doesnt make sense at first and you cant see how this relates to you realize theres a very good and simple reason for this fall from great heights the buzz aldrin syndrome understand as we use the internet to accumulate the wisdom and knowledge to rocket past our contemporaries and excel in life a problem is festering that you are unaware of additionally much like alzheimers it is not prevalent today but as humans advance more and live longer it will become increasingly common therefore we have the option to identify it today prepare for it now and thus avoid the pain and insanity that comes with having a problem we cant identify or we can have it devastate our lives later it is the buzz aldrin syndrome the buzz aldrin syndrome is where a man achieves such greatness such accomplishments in life that he is truly unrivaled and peerless while exhilarating at first perhaps even earning one fame riches and fortune the success also unintentionally alienates the person from the rest of society at the time buzz aldrin only had three or four other astronauts who he could really talk to confide in and relate to the remaining billion people on the planet at the time were just starstruck wideeyed sheep alas buzz aldrin could be surrounded by scores of fans at a party but still be completely alone mentally the syndrome is also exacerbated as ones pinnacle achievements in life are likely correlated with retirement you typically progress in your career right up until the day you retire however here you leave the environment and network youve come accustomed thrived in and derived your entire agency from thus in a very short period of time you go from the center of attention the life of the party the engine of the machineto a retiree in california drinking scotch and eating kfc longing for the days you could go back to the office again without the environment you derived all your worth and value from you lose purpose in life you lose mental stimulation you lose your peers and very likely sink into a crippling depression the perfect storm there are seven factors that when combined create the perfect storm for the buzz aldrin syndrome to form and most rok readers either have these traits are affected by them technological advancements technology has always advanced but in this particular case it affects us in two specific ways making living expenses cheaper and allowing for more and easier ways to make money as opposed to the s most of a mans life was spent toiling in the field he didnt have time to contemplate loftier or heavier subjects much like the purpose of life what is mans reason for being etc you had to worry about the plague tetanus your wife dying in labor and whether thered be enough crops to survive the coming winter but today through economics capitalism agricultural technology etc a single man can basically eat for nearfree at walmart or the local grocery store technology has also freed us from work not so much from the fact we have to work but in terms of how much time we need to spend on it in order to survive no more than a decade ago a young man had to work hours a week for a commute and likely for an inept baby boomer boss who was never going to let you get past the cubicle plantation now with the internet not only can a man give the proverbial finger to rush hour and a commute but his boss as well making whatever minimalistic modicum of money he needs to survive through online entrepreneurship in short it has never been easier to satisfy maslows first three and vital hierarchy of needs freeing a mans mind to pursue his own excellence not to mention ponder his point and purpose in being here minimalism it is no secret that red pill men practice or at least pursue minimalism we know that material things do not matter as it is the love and friendship from our fellow man friends family and loved ones that matter most you know that it would be nice to have that shelby super snake mustang but youd never trade it in for a lifetime of conversations and cigars with your best friend additionally we value our freedom above all else and refuse to subjugate ourselves to becoming debt slaves by buying things we plain dont need jettisoning these material desires liberates more of our finite lives from work and a commute to once again pursue our passions our fields our adventures and our lives in simply refusing to buy a mcmansion and take on a car loan we guarantee we will live more interesting and rewarding lives than of our peers avoiding divorce and unwanted children further saving us more time is the disproportionate number of us refusing to have children or marry in fear of divorce and for those of us who do marry we are fully aware of what to look for more or less immunizing us from divorce knowledge of women to be blunt and honestly assess the good the manosphere and red pill community have done we have saved the lives of millions of young men and prevented older ones from wasting what remains of theirs if i were to estimate it every boy born today will save at least a decade of time that would have otherwise been wasted at nightclubs chasing tail dating the wrong girls and perhaps even marrying the wrong ones being a product of the s i have often talked with my gen x peers where we estimated what we could have done had we not wasted the s and s chasing women we were either never going to get or would regret catching we could have easily had doctorates houses built by our own hands much better careers not to mention better mental health as we would have avoided all the batshit insane women we sifted through young men today especially those who consume the red pill will easily have a decade of time on us by simply learning from our mistakes selfimprovement unless you are in the virgintow community you know how important selfimprovement is to a mans life you have this one finite life on this planet and not only is it imperative you enjoy it but you must ensure it is a masterpiece of art in whatever endeavors you choose to excel in this may not land you on the moon but you will achieve greatness and excellence in some capacity or another music literature innovation philosophy being a good dad something you will not idly stand by sitting on your ass majoring in sociology or collecting a welfare check as you knock up baby mama after baby momma you will be notable and leave a positive legacy on this world entrepreneurship or stem most of you know not to major in stupid worthless shit you also know that for the majority of us entrepreneurship or selfemployment is the only form of employment that we can tolerate because of this two things will happen in your life one you will save an inordinate amount of time spent trying to make a go at a career that just isnt in demand in the real world you will work as an engineer a programmer a doctor or some real professiontrade which will not only pay you a handsome wage but make your life incredibly easier two at some point in time you will come up with an idea that will either cement your success in your career or outright launch a successful entrepreneurial endeavor this will free you from your dependence on traditional employers ensure your financial future is sound but it will also likely lead towards you achieving your legacy in excellence in the veritable sea of liberal arts majors not one of their millions will ever make anything of themselves they will simply waste away doubling down on masters degrees and doctorates in their hopelessly worthless fields worse they will be crippled until death with student loans and inadequate compensation as they beg and vote for other peoples money they will die like most unmentionable irrelevant and forgotten you will not a high intelligence to make all of this a reality you need the raw intellectual capacity to bring this to fruition while no studies have been done if you have the independent mindedness to be reading rok id estimate the average iq of rok readers to be however keep in mind while being highly intelligent is an asset it is also a curse like rok you are on the fringe and because of that you are not only going to receive an inordinate amount of flak from the rest of normie society but relating to the rest of it let alone finding a healthy and rewarding social life in it is going to prove next to impossible when you combine these traits and conditions you have what is arguably the perfect environment for a great life to form you need very little to survive because you wont waste your resources on frivolous material things in life you also have very little liabilities or responsibilities not only because youre a minimalist but are likely not going to marry or have children the lions share of your time and energies can be dedicated towards achieving excellence and greatness in your life and if youve done it right youll be two decades ahead of your gen x peers since you avoided worthless degrees and leapfrogged your philosophical understanding of life you will be accomplished you will be successful you will have paid a fraction of the mental toll to get there and you will indeed be an amazing man the worlds most interesting perhaps you have reached the so called finish line much earlier and faster than buzz aldrin and thats when your real problems start you werent meant to be here understand that while the goal of man was to secure unlimited food resources and security so that he may pursue an unlimited and happy life the human mind has no experience being here the entire existence of humankind has been struggle suffering fighting and striving for such a life but also of the time failing and over the course of human history the human brain has had million years experience and conditioning in failure not success this leads to an ironic and perhaps the most tragic instances in human experiences a man finally gets what he wants wealth health success excellence legacy everything but upon attaining it he cant enjoy it because the human mind is not programmed to he not only realizes this rare success doesnt result in happiness or a perpetual lifelong glee that will see him to his grave but theres nothing left to conquer theres nothing left to do the game of life is over and like red dead redemption it gets mighty boring just riding your horse around after you conquer the game worse because of the unique characteristics required to attain this excellence any man lucky enough to be this successful is in one way or another ostracized from the rest of his peers professionally romantically intellectually some way or another to be in that you have to be a statistical freak alas you get to suffer the true symptoms of the buzz aldrin syndrome peerlessness while your friends are pumping out children or your colleagues are trying to get out from underneath their mcmansion mortgage and impending divorce you may be avoiding these dreaded fates but you are also alone no longer are these the college days where your intellectual peers in equal lifecircumstances can hang out chat philosophize and in numbers that seem endless slowly but surely they will get picked off like german messerschmitts in wwii by the forces of life and you will be left alone understand this has nothing to do with your pursuit of greatness or achieving excellence in life but is outside of your control as these people fall within the bell distribution curve of averageness they choose these lives meaning its not the statistical freak leaving them but them leaving the statistical freak no matter how loudly they claimed in college they were going to live life differently and dont think that you can simply recoup your former social life by joining them by being average putting on a sports jersey ordering some buffalo wild wings cheering on the local sportsball team your mind wont tolerate it you are peerless get used to it boredom without people you get bored no matter how intelligent you are you are still human and humans are indeed social creatures as they derive their entire life value from others not things but the paradox those suffering from the buzz aldrin syndrome face is that while you would like to be social with people the vast majority of people are either too common too stupid or just too boring especially when compared to being by yourself go to that same buffalo wild wings to hear loud drunk divorced swpl men in their s cheer on the local swingystick team or read marcus aurelius go to a movie where jason bourne discovers another mole in the ciaagainwho set up his fatheragainwhere he drives around europe shooting the place upagain or binge on some history podcasts i know how about you go to a party where youll hear the same conversations from men about the sportsball game they just saw at buffalo wild wings as they lament their inability to get out from underneath their mortgage while the wives gossip about their painfully pointless governmentmakework careers while talking about how great the cake is or road trip out west and do some hiking in the desert the larger point is not only are the vast majority of people not intellectually stimulating enough but good luck finding enough of them who have the freedom and finances to do anything besides hit up happy hour when wifey lets them out of the house and then theres frustration being unencumbered by the daily scourge of chores children finances mortgages and commutes your mind will be unshackled to pursue whatever intellectual pursuits it wishes to pursue youll solve world problems in an afternoon that politicians are taking eons to not solve youll come up with some and many viable business ideas discarding most of them because you have not the time to put them all into execution youll see the obvious solutions to making your friends and love ones lives infinitely better but theyll have the horseblinders on so tight theyll ignore your wisdom or youll make a great scientific discovery at work while your boss dismisses it away and threatens to fire you for having an independent thought it is simply the real world telling you you dont control everything and matter of fact most of this world was not meant for you obviously you can see where depression alcoholism and ennui set in you can see where the pursuit and successful attainment of excellence in life can lead to unintentional alienation and ostracization from the rest of society and since society is where all humans geniuses or not successful or not get their value you can see the downside to zooming past the finish line of life especially at increasingly earlier ages as technology and minimalism permit it the solution is in part to find quality people who can be lifelong friends colleagues peers and comrades perhaps even get married if you find the right girl and no matter what keep yourself and your mind occupied hobbies interests pursuits etc inactivity is death but ultimately what is going to best prepare you for whats coming is to simply know its coming nirvana and heaven are not at the other side of that finish line an active and rewarding social life full of close friends and loved ones are the not the reward for success and it certainly isnt a lifelong party until you die it is a mentallybarren landscape much like the moon a place buzz has been to both literally and metaphorically,1

society andré is a young european who left his decaying country in for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november culture the existence of intellectuals is more ubiquitous today than ever many are those who contend for public attention credibility and money as a reward for their wits not to mention the very status of intellectual yet the existence of such people is far from selfevident for centuries traditional societies barely had anything or anybody that looked like modern intellectuals and this did not prevent them from lasting hundreds or even thousands of years so as we elaborate projects and ideas for reforming the depraved societies of the empire of nothinga necessary step if we want a lasting victoryan important question must be confronted do we need at all what has been called intellectuals during last centuries and if we do not what should we have instead the origin of modern intellectuals at the heart of modernity lies a deep crisis before it western europe was united by the same christian faith and a basic agreement on the place of economysubordinated to guilds and the rights of the average producer when modernity reared its philosophical head through rené descartes a prominent thinker of the seventeenth century the old continent was in a much more problematic state christianity had splintered into various opposing faiths whose intellectual opposition was shaking everything to the core we have been told that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a glorious new flourishing of intelligence but in fact thinkers who actually lived at this time had quite a different impression the irish bishop george berkeley criticized how the practice of philosophy had become on his age synonymous with getting embroiled into thousand scruples prejudices and errors of sense a situation he attributed to the wrong use we make of our faculties likewise the scottish philosopher david hume scolded his contemporaries for being too eager to criticize the systems of others for the sake of pushing their own on the scene that is a mutual hypercriticism that led to a general lack of certitude about everything there is nothing which is not the subject of debate and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions the most trivial question escapes not our controversy and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision disputes are multiplied as if everything was uncertain and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth as if everything was certain amidst all this bustle it is not reason which carries the prize but eloquence from hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds the first precursors were honest in their endeavour to solve the crisis descartes berkeley hume and many others genuinely sought a grand encompassing theory that could resume with all controversies but soon the very controversy became an institution a whole market of ideas was growing in which more and more lettrés started to see an opportunity to make a name thus earning fame social standing and sometimes money hume could not help himself soon after criticizing those who fed the crisis by attacking the others systems while promoting their own he was doing the same such was the socalled enlightenment the further undermining of any spiritual philosophical or cultural unity by ambitious individuals ready to hustle for notoriety they would be experts at flattering the powerful mocking the catholic church fiddle fashionable themes and witty prose and more than everything else rationalizing their activity as a progress the very expression enlightenment stems from their willingness to market themselves to the posterity the intellectuals bread and butter it can be noted that from the amateur gentlemen of the eighteenth century generations of scientists have sprang up some of these characters were mathematicians engineers doctors or dedicated observers of nature and they all contributed to improving general human power over matter but make no mistake even science needs problems and unknown stuff to justify careers and research thus following a headlong rush dynamic at its side the literary intellectuals need more problems so they can have the opportunity to sell themselves through claiming they want to solve them the momentous crisis turned into a crisis structure and the structure turned into a mark of the modern west where god ceased to speak the modern talking head took more and more territory and wrote dozens of books trying to prove he was the embodiment of progress it doesnt matter if problems are genuine or artificial intellectuals need them like a blacksmith needs iron two typical intellectual characters are voltaire and émile zola both were gifted writers both were charming and witty both managed to write about matters that were actually relevant to their times and both have used a trial with political overtones to make a show of themselves not so incidentally both were french and participated to the furthering of a twisted literary chauvinism voltaire took advantage of various trials to claim that the defendants were accused because they were protestants inside a catholic country the infamous affaire calas from the name of a father who was accused of having murdered his own son was used by the shrewd philosophe to sending pathetic letters to the upper crust of the society stirring the public opinion pressuring magistrates until the fatherwho had been convicted and executed after a thorough investigationwas rehabilitated two centuries and a half later young frenchmen are still taught voltaire was a champion of truth justice and reason whereas he was more like a playwright who peddled influence zola more than a century later did the same a jewishfrench captain alfred dreyfus was convicted for high treason after he allegedly communicated secret documents to prussia years later some new evidence seemed to indicate that dreyfus was innocent and that another officer had leaked the documents at this very moment zola published an incendiary article jaccuse where he spat on the judges and cried about the injustice of the affaire eventually dreyfus was rehabilitatedand the army the patriots and the catholics were shamed through a neverending media discourse that casted them as villains of the whole story voltaire and zola played the same role in a narrative of the exact same kind we are taught about a situation of injustice where the majority of the population is oppressing an innocent group through an innocent individual and crooked institutions fortunately a heroic talking head rises miraculously converts the opinion to recognize the poor innocent victim as such the talking head is crowned as an awesome thinker beyond boundaries whereas some are fairly vilified as oppressors and the poor victims rehabilitation is also the victory of reason justice and progress thus the intellectuel in the most typical sense is a highly paradoxical creature who becomes taught in classes after having seemingly rebelled against dominant institutions teenagers are led to think that heroic and highly intelligent individuals can turn the tide of unfavourable opinion provided they follow a mysterious sense of history there have been a lot more intellectuals than the mere classics and often those rejected by the official narrative are more interesting than those inside whos gonna pay even if you are gifted with words and language being a talking head does not pay much would anyone be ready to pay you for giving an opinion no matter how elaborate on anything the problem of money is a good starting point to connect the dots voltaire was close from wealthy protestants bankers one of whom even helped him to obtain a house in geneva and zola was a rotschild protégé both of them contributed to tarnish catholicism and most of their own people in other words they served interests that could pay themthey were sellouts today some bloggers happen to earn money as independents especially when they found themselves a niche yet independence is scarce way too many people would like to live from their wits and even more obtain recognition as intellectuals more than often intellectual types turn into teachers journalists or even marketersthus depending upon an institution that pays them in north america the war against whites and masculinity is massively subsidized whether in the academic or in the media you wont easily find a job there if you take a critical stance on cultural marxism and in case you wouldnt be selfhating enough they are already replacing you with minority individuals who are rewarded for spewing wordy venom daily old marxism was wellaligned with the interests of intellectuals as a class not as individuals it handed them an official status and flattered their ego by casting them as the vanguard of progress keynesianism triumphed for the exact same reason as it justified the creation of a bloated state where modelobsessed nerds enjoy a tremendous power over those who produce actual wealth intellectual types historically joined the left because it gave them a status money and moral recognition but the whole marxist vocabulary of progress and emancipation dissimulated what seems glaring today namely that intellectuals were recognized and paid not because they were enlightened or bright but because they were an efficient tool of destruction the conservative right has often lacked a milieu for intellectual types the average conservative was reluctant to pay someone he saw as a parasite such a lack pushed a number of high iqs to the arms of the left who made an establishment out of them and paid them to enforce globalism antiwhiteness antimasculinity pathological altruism transgender madness politically correct repression and so on intellectuals were never paid to say the truth they were paid as tools who performed a primarily destructive social function if we happen to beat cultural marxism what shall we do with intellectual types if we are to dismantle globalism and build healthier societies we have to think about what we will replace the bobo leftist establishment the intellectual mediocrity and spinelessness of the average conservative is no solution a truly traditional society would likely have initiates something akin to high priests and knights in lieu of vacuous and coward talkers how exactly we go there or how exactly this could look today is another question conclusion the french essayist alain soral once famously said a journalist is either a whore or without a job this is even truer for most intellectuals sold as they are to a destructive left or more seldomly to the inefficient right culture is overrated what the mainstream refers to under that name is a giant matrix full of lies taboos and the snobbery of talking heads who end up lying to everyone or believing into their own bullshit no wonder why the shrewd robert greene advised to be an intense realist one must cultivate inner intuition and situational awareness not to fall prey to some of the claptrap that constitutes at least eighty per cent of current mainstream culture the previous generations could join the cultural marxist establishment and pretend their destructive egoladen works were progress to our generation this is impossible either we stand up for our very existence even if we must go against more than two centuries of manipulations and lies or we resign ourselves to an ignominious death before we take the power back a shared awareness must be stimulated and this is where we enter in direct conflict with the wellfunded antiwhite antimasculine establishment types whom we must beat on their own field once and for all bonus quotes about the intellectuels some of the problems that modern philosophical thinking puts forward appear void of any importance and meaning modern philosophy features a range of issues that merely stem from an equivocal stance and the confusion of different viewpoints these issues only exist because they are poorly framed they have no fundamental reason to exist in many cases defining their statements more precisely may be enough to make them disappear plain and simple if modern philosophy did not strive to maintain them because it makes a living out of ambiguity rené guénon introduction to the study of the hindu doctrines chap rené guénon young philosophers care much more about putting forth problems no matter how artificial and illusory than about solving them they also strive to link their name to a system that is to a strictly bounded set of theories they would own and consider as their nothing more than their own work hence the desire to be original at any price even if the truth must be sacrificed on the altar of said originality a philosopher who cares about his repute does better by making up a new mistake than by repeating some truth that has already been expressed by others rené guénon the crisis of the modern world chap rené guénon older the most evident feature of modern critique is the lack of principles and of authenticity its greater preoccupation consists in being brilliant in appearing original from the point of view of those who embody this intellectuality the catchy line the dialectical or polemical posturing well noticed by others have a much greater value than truth ideas when they use them are nothing but a pretext what matters is to look intelligentjust as to the mainstream politician the ideology of a party is essentially a means for career the vanity fair the most deleterious subjectivism often verging on pure and unmitigated narcissism are essential components of this phenomenon the critique is a scourge of modern culture an epidemic that was born out of bourgeois society concomitantly with the commodification of culture in normal traditional civilizations one could find creators artists and those who would judge the works without intermediaries the sovereigns the patrons and the people our times have witnessed the appearance between the public and the creators that cultural pimp that cheeky and presumptuous parasite we call a critique julius evola the bow and the club baron giulio cesare evola show me more venal more insensitive more corrupt minds than those of the literate caste how many of them do you know whose virtue would still be uncorrupted who but them for over thirty years kept flooding us with a loosened morale a disdain for work a disgust of duty a disrespect for family who but the

begging for their favours socalled men of letters always they run like harlots between the legitimate government and usurpers between monarchy and republic between politics and socialism between atheism and religion everything is good to them as long as they can make a profit and be fashionable out of it pierrejoseph proudhon quoted by the following one pierrejoseph proudon compare for example seventeenth century writers with those of the eighteenth what a difference in tone and gait the former under a veneer of servility have the most noble and proud stance they do not pretend to reign they merely stand at their place recognize the place of a superior power beyond give themselves completely to their writing task dismiss the temptation of advertising and demonstrate their professional dedication on the other hand look at the voltaire diderot and the like they open well the era of intellectuals writing stooges as they are courtiers of princes they flatter and despise at the same timesomething they are forced to do as they want to usurp their power their courtier nature reveals in everything they do the whole eighteenth century both spiritual and plain on a scoundrel background is libertine and already pornographic such is the start of literary mercantilism people of letters make money out of their writings pretend to financial independence and they write garbage

economy he must shut down the federal reserve if he just tries to patch up our current system he will fail because it has been fundamentally flawed from the very beginning a little over a century ago very powerful forces on wall street convinced congress to completely restructure our financial system an immensely powerful central bank known as the federal reserve was created and the goal was to transform the us dollar into a debtbased currency that would continuously be inflated and to create an endless debt spiral from which could never possibly escape sadly they were successful on both counts since the creation of the federal reserve the value of the us dollar has declined by approximately percent and our national debt has gotten more than times larger americans tend to give most of the credit or most of the blame for the performance of the us economy to our presidents but the truth is that an unelected unaccountable group of central bankers has far more power over our economy than anyone else does the federal reserve has become known as the fourth branch of government but unlike the other branches of government we are told that the feds decisions are above politics because they are too important fed officials fiercely guard their independence and they fiercely resist any interference from congress the president or the american people donald trump can try to lower taxes and reduce regulations but what he will be able to do to influence the economy pales in comparison to the immensely powerful tools that the fed wields the fed controls interest rates the fed controls the money supply and the fed regulates the banks to give you an idea of how enormously powerful the fed is i want you to pull out a dollar bill as you look at that dollar bill i want you to notice that it says federal reserve note right at the top in the financial world a note is an instrument of debt and the truth is that our system was designed to create as much debt as possible so why are we using debtbased federal reserve notes in the first place shouldnt congress have control over our currency according to article i section of the us constitution it is congress that has the authority to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures so how did the fed get involved well it is a very long and convoluted story and if you are interested in the history behind it i would commend to you an excellent book by c edward griffin entitled the creature from jekyll island a second look at the federal reserve basically big money interests on wall street got their hooks into the white house and congress and they rushed through legislation right before christmas in that created this insidious central banking system that was designed to slowly but surely take wealth from the american people and put it into their hands sadly most americans dont even realize that we have a debtbased currency nor do they understand where our money comes from in a previous article i discussed how money is normally created by the federal reserve under our current system when the us government decides that it wants to spend another billion dollars that it does not have it does not print up a billion dollars rather the us government creates a bunch of us treasury bonds debt and takes them over to the federal reserve the federal reserve creates a billion dollars out of thin air and exchanges them for the us treasury bonds the federal reserve takes the us treasury bonds that it receives in exchange for the federal reserve notes that it gave to the government and it auctions off those bonds to the highest bidder but of course this process always creates more debt than it does money the us treasury bonds that the federal reserve receives in exchange for the money it has created out of nothing are auctioned off through the federal reserve system but wait there is a problem because the us government must pay interest on the treasury bonds the amount of debt that has been created by this transaction is greater than the amount of money that has been created so where will the us government get the money to pay that debt well the theory is that we can get money to circulate through the economy really really fast and tax it at a high enough rate that the government will be able to collect enough taxes to pay the debt but that never actually happens does it and the creators of the federal reserve understood this as well they understood that the us government would not have enough money to both run the government and service the national debt they knew that the us government would have to keep borrowing even more money in an attempt to keep up with the game so our debt just keeps going up and up and up while barack obama has been in the white house our national debt has risen by more than trillion dollars and at this moment it is sitting just under the trillion dollar mark but we shouldnt be surprised by this because this is precisely what the federal reserve system was designed to do to us many conservatives still hold to the mistaken illusion that we could somehow pay all of this debt back someday but as i have shown in a previous article this is mathematically impossible to do if the government went out today and grabbed every single dollar in existence we could not pay back the national debt and of course we have of household debt of corporate debt and of state and local government debt that we need to pay back as well under the current system our only hope is to keep the wheel spinning by continuing to devalue the dollar and by continuing to go into even greater amounts of debt and of course it isnt just the united states that is in this predicament at this point almost every single nation on the entire planet has a central bank even though there are extremely sharp disagreements among nations on virtually everything else somehow central banking has achieved nearly universal adoption as you read this article well over of the population of the globe lives in a country that has a central bank do you think that is just a coincidence of course there are still a few very small countries such as the federated states of micronesia that do not have a central bank but the only big nation not to have one is north korea and you would literally have to be insane to want to live in north korea but now we have an opportunity to get free from this insidious system the truth is that we dont have to have a central bank in fact the greatest period of economic growth in us history was when there was no central bank we dont need central planners to set our interest rates and to manipulate our money supply they will never admit this but the reality of the matter is that their interference in the economy often creates tremendous economic busts since the federal reserve was created in there have been distinct recessions or depressions considering their track record isnt it time for a change and we dont have to have a debtbased currency in fact not too long ago we had a president that decided to start issuing debtfree united states notes back in president john f kennedy issued executive order which authorized the us treasury to issue debtfree united states notes which were directly created by the us government he was assassinated shortly thereafter most americans dont realize this but many of the debtfree united states notes that were issued under president kennedy are still in circulation today and president trump could do something similar but will he it has been said that the borrower is the servant of the lender and the federal reserve system has turned all of us into debt slaves debt is a form of social control and the global elite use all of this debt to dominate the planet the total amount of debt in the world just hit of trillion dollars and the longer we allow the central banks to control the system the bigger this debt bubble will become here in the united states that starts with shutting issuing debtfree currency it would take someone very bold to make a move like this and so let us hope that the man that we just elected is up to the task,1

solely aimed at disarming the people and depriving them of the sacred right to defend themselves has shown its vast ineffiency with gun victims and terrorist attacks on the rise in those zones since no honest citizen can shoot back to stop the massacre here is why i propose once a conservative government reaches the white house to create fat control laws fcl and obesityfree zones ofz as obesity is indeed a more serious threat to the lives of americans than honest citizens carrying legally purchased guns here are six potential benefits simple philanthropy obese people are delusional thinking

and suspicion fat and sedentary lifestyles kill much more than guns the war against obesity is as important as the war on crime or drugs bovine people not only harm themselves but others too by creating measures to prevent them from becoming fat or exhorting them lose weight we are helping our common man to preserve his dignity as a human being in their case sugar and salt create a dopamine rush and an addiction loop very similar to an addiction to opiates we must show our potbellied or barrelbellied junkies the way as they cant take the steps themselves just like with restrictions on cigarettes if they are stupid enough to gorge themselves on calories we must conclude that there is a severe lack of judgement on their part and prevent them from purchasing the source of their misery preserving aesthetics and other senses no more eyesore of seeing fatties rolling around everywhere you go imagine a beach with a plethora of more feminine attractive and thin women by banning whales in bikinis our nostrils would also be free of the olfactory offence that they throw in our faces say goodbye to the pungent smell of fat rolls sweat at your local grocery store no more lb sjw land whales with laboured breath sounds in waiting rooms or uncontrolled farting in the public transport like you are in a cattle train it could be tomorrow positive impact on children i do not want these people to roam free and that my future progeny can witness it and think that this is normal worse if the pc politburo tells them it is beautiful to be a beached whale lets send them far until they get better out of sight out of mind as they say legal elements should be implemented against pernicious publicity aired on television and directly aimed at children whether by the time chosen to air it or the promotion it makes of unhealthy eating of course with fat control policies kids will get bullied at school some will cut themselves for being called fattie so what adapt and overcome or crawl in a ball and cry the weakest has to be left behind if he does not want to save himself a healthier population you are under arrest for being an immovable gargantuan arsehole fat is not a silent killer hundreds of thousands of people die with a loud thud every year of obesityrelated diseases a largely preventable cause of death worldwide today in americans and in britons dies from being a fat arse with no selfcontrol it is a fact that obesity causes death by cardiac arrest diabetes coronary and liver diseases cancer and hypertension among others promoting a healthy lifestyle and physical activity will create a longer life expectancy physically healthier people are mentally healthier too boost of selfesteem and confidence fat control laws will reduce mental health issues such as depression inferiority complex or suicidal tendencies caused by obesity that is also less money spent by the taxpayer a boost for the economy according to a report ham planets cost the economy billion a year and that is for the american economy alone the number of human cattle is still growing exponentially it inflicted more than a billion loss to the economy in in we can reasonably assume that the number of obese people has grown and has impacted the wallet of your average american even harder a fitter population with its nutritional choices would result in a more natural higherquality food industry smaller amounts of food produced and needed resulting in reduced resources and materials wasted during and after its production we could see the end of excessive fossil fuel used to transport land walruses and their fat arse across long distances and hogging the space that could be use by three normal individuals healthier more active people are happier more productive and successful since the cogs of the machinery are not coated in fat an age of stronger selfgoverned highenergy men bringing a healthier society its yuge a new sexual and romantic market it will bring a more balanced sexual arena to limit the accumulation of fat a radical answer to the phenomenon of plummeting testosterone levels caused by high fat percentage trimming the numbers of plump omegas and sexual market voluntary rejects lets impose a healthier diet for higher numbers of attractive thin and pretty women greater numbers of quality girls to choose from reduces aggressive competition which decreases the bitch shields of thin entitled girls endless supplies of betas queuing to capture crumbs of their attention would be a thing of the past as i said it before male thirst is the root of all evil when it comes to romantic competition sexier citizens means more relationships a peak in libido and reproduction of physically and mentally balanced individual helping nations suffering from low birth rate one more element for the protection of western society being the most affected one and its people cementing the bases of a strong future fighting globalism and the myth they try to sell us about global overpopulation by logical natural process bronies corpulent manchildren and manga conventions should also disappear soon the fat control laws segregated obesityfree zones our diabetic mammoths must be isolated from further propaganda and tasty treats this is why we should create large very large fenced areas to protect the healthy subjects as fat is more dangerous than guns lets pen the bigboned rejects in separated zones where access to junk food and other harmful products would be forbidden fresh water open spaces salad and treadmills as far as the eye could see build that fence we shall call it the david fatrelle center for porcine rehabilitation permits a permit would have to be issued similar to a guncarrying permit for the purchase of junk food highcarb snacks soda drinks etc after a doctors physical exam of the patient slim citizens would be delivered a permit with a stamp of approval granting them access to supermarkets or venues where processed or junk food is served mandatory workouts compulsory exercise would be imposed to obese people to reach a standard bmi we could bring it up a notch where a fine could be issued after a determined period of time if the weight loss target has not been reached a steps counter activity tracker would have to be worn or installed on their smartphone and a quota of physical activity would have to be reached on a day to day basis just like the programs for convicted criminals or drug abusers with reports to the local police station on a regular basis the stubbornly chunky would be followed during a rehabilitation stage and their progress monitored fat shaming fat shaming works great as we have seen before remember the shitstorm of the beach body campaign immediately declared thought criminals by the body positive lobby or islamic thought tribunal of londonistan or the coldblooded leaflets given by anonymous though criminals to particularly adipose london tube passengers yuge success pourquoi ça nexiste pas fat people are a dead weight to society in all senses of the term and to compensate this burden they must chip in one way or another and repair the harm they cause fitter people means a selfaware powerful mass that strives for greatness but the liberals in charge dont want that this is why they produce massive amounts of harmful processed food and encourage the pleb by manipulating

neighbors the turks have not been pacifists but militarists t roosevelt fear god p armenians have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the napoleonic warsthe wars of genghis khan and tamerlane in asia yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged this course of national infamy began when the last administration surrendered to the peace atanyprice people and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties individuals and nations who preach the

eyewitness of the fearful atrocities mr arthur h gleason new york tribune nov serbia is at this moment passing under the harrow of torture and mortal anguish now the armenians have been butchered under circumstances of murder and torture and rape that would have appealed to an oldtime apache indian even to nerves dulled and jaded by the heapedup horrors of the past year and a half the news of the terrible fate that has befallen the armenians must give a fresh shock of sympathy and indignation let me emphatically point out that the sympathy is useless unless it is accompanied with indignation and that the indignation is useless if it exhausts itself in words instead of taking shape in deeds if this people through its government had not shirked its duty we would now be able to take effective action on behalf of armenia mass meetings on behalf of the armenians amount to nothing whatever if they are mere methods of giving a sentimental but ineffective and safe outlet to the emotion of those engaged in them the principles of the peaceatanyprice men of the professional pacifists will be as absolutely ineffective for international righteousness this crowning iniquity of the wholesale slaughter of the armenians must be shared by the neutral powers headed by the united states for their failure to protest when this initial wrong was committed the devastation of poland and serbia has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the seventeenthcentury europe weak and timid milkandwater policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the bloodandiron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world the crowning outrage has been committed by the turks on the armenians they have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of attila and of genghis khan it is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks neutral not only in deed but in thought between right and the most hideous wrong neutral between despairing and hunted people people whose little children are murdered and their women raped and the victorious and evil wrongdoers i trust that all americans worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful armenian atrocities i trust that they feel that a peace obtained without righting the wrongs of the armenians would be worse than any war wrongdoing will only be stopped by men who are brave as well as just who put honor above safety who are true to a lofty ideal of duty who prepare in advance to make their strength effective and who shrink from no hazard not even the final hazard of war if necessary in order to serve the great cause of righteousness when our people take this stand we shall also be able effectively to take a stand in international matters which shall prevent such cataclysms of wrong as have been witnesseson an even greater scale in armenia t roosevelt fear god pp in his book fear god and take your part theodore roosevelt wrote christianity is not the creed of asia and africa at this moment solely because the seventh century christians of asia and africa had trained themselves not to fight whereas the moslems were trained to fight christianity was saved in europe solely because the peoples of europe fought if the peoples of europe in the th and th centuries and on up to and including the th century had not possessed a military equality with and gradually a growing superiority over the mohammedans who invaded europe europe would at this moment be mohammedan and the christian religion would be exterminated a contemporary of theodore roosevelt was the english author gk chesterton who wrote of western christian civilization the collected works

ridden into paris theodore roosevelt continued in fear god and take your part wherever the mohammedans have had complete sway wherever the christians have been unable to resist them by the sword christianity has ultimately disappeared from the hammer of charles martel to the sword of jan sobieski christianity owed its safety in europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and

a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam like a warped islamic version of santa claus obama had a secret muslim list and his people checked it at least twice the list was of muslims who were prospects for important jobs and appointments it included a muslim who had described israel as an apartheid state irans goto guy in new york financial circles and a number of figures linked to the muslim brotherhood it was the ultimate religious test from an administration that had vocally rejected them obama had claimed that having religious tests for migration was shameful and not american when i hear folks say that well maybe we should just admit the christians but not the muslims he huffed from turkey his muslim host country was run by a bigoted sponsor of islamic terror we dont have religious tests he insisted except we did and we do obama also had religious tests his religious tests excluded christians and favored muslims that is why his syrian refugees were between and muslim with only christians and yazidis even though both groups are real victims of the muslim religious war syria is christian and hundreds of thousands have been displaced yet only have made it past obamas iron curtain thats either an islamic religious test or the worlds greatest coincidence but would the man who piously lectured us on the evils of religious tests really have a religious test of course he would the hacked emails include a list of muslim american candidates for top administration jobs subcabinet jobs and outside boardsagenciespolicy committees the list was sent to john podesta who headed the obamabiden transition project it had been put together by a woman who had sat on the commission on international religious freedom but boasted that she had excluded those with some arab american background but who are not muslim eg george mitchell many lebanese americans for example are christian how shameful how not american of barack hussein obama most who are listed appear to be muslimamerican except that a handful where noted may be arab american but of uncertain religion esp christian she assured podesta religious tests are only out of line when they exclude muslims not when they exclude christians thats the pattern which emerged from the obamabiden transition project and obamas refugee policy there has been a clear pattern of administration bias against christians and jews and in favor of muslims that bias has been obvious in a foreign policy which backed islamic supremacist groups such as the muslim brotherhood over more moderate governments at the expense of nonmuslim populations this policy led to the displacement and death of countless christians and the persecution of entire communities by an administration which then denied safe harbor to the victims of its own policies administration bias replicated that same bigoted policy at home when it favored islamic candidates obama appointed farooq kathwari the first name on the muslim list sent to podesta to the presidents advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders the muslim list email had warned that kathwaris then yearold americaneducated son irfan aka imran was killed in fighting jihad against the russians in afghanistan the actions of his son who may have been with the mujahedeen but was also apparently outraged over indias defense of kashmir is of less relevance than kathwaris appearance at an isna conference and another conference cosponsored by the muslim students association both groups are linked to the muslim brotherhood he cochaired the american muslim task force whose members included salam almarayati director of the muslim public affairs council which has defended hamas and hezbollah yahya basha president of the american muslim council and a former board member of the muslim public affairs council and assorted other islamists its report complained that muslims were inhibited from donating to charities run by islamic terrorist groups such as hezbollah yahya basha also appeared on obamas muslim list also listed was mpacs aslam abdullah who had claimed that zionists christians and hindus were behind the war on terror he had described israel as an apartheid state and a racist state the second muslim on the list cyrus amirmokri was named assistant treasury secretary he became the first iranian to be named to such a high position and defended the iran nuclear sellout mokri attended a meeting with members of the iran lobby at the white house he also reportedly advised obama on iranian sanctions obama had famously told nasa boss bolden that one of his three tasks at the space agency was muslim selfesteem but bolden almost didnt make it in the muslim list included two alternative candidates for nasa administrator one of them dr charles elachi of jpl was dismissed as possibly christian indeed elachi who grew up admiring john wayne and believes that american success is possible because it isnt held back by the longstanding ingrained systems and beliefs found in the middle east would have been a rather poor fit but it is deeply shameful and unamerican that his potential nasa appointment questioned his religion that is an inappropriate religious test that obama must apologize for the other name on the list however is firouz naderi an iranian board member of the public affairs alliance of iranian americans which advocated in support of the iran nuke sellout eboo patel whose name would frequently appear on lists of islamists in the obama administration first made an appearance on the muslim list despite his islamist ties he got the posting at the advisory council on faithbased neighborhood partnerships also listed were keith ellison andre carson and larry shaw shaw sits on the board of cair dilawar syed the first name to appear on the list of possible appointments was named to obamas advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders syed is a cofounder and chair of the asian americans and pacific islander victory fund which has come out for hillary clinton the secret muslim list describes him as animated by policy issues relating to the muslim world a similar description is appended to the bio for kashif zafar who served as a cochair of the south asian american leadership council at the dnc also on the list was hamid biglari bloomberg described biglari as irans man in new york and as the iranian presidents goto guy in new york financial circles biglari was a key iran lobby figure the recently revealed secret muslim list is deeply troubling there should be no religious test for political appointments yet obama had one and his people sought to screen out christians and favor muslims this represents behavior that is in obamas own words shameful and not american one cant help but conclude that based on his own principles obama is shameful and not american,1

at least in my opinion the below is true even if its not as exciting as cgi videos my main reason for posting is about one of the very few times i saw stuff back in summer of july i went on a camping trip to possum kingdom lake in west texas with a friend robert my last trip as a single guy before i got married the following month the trip was a lot of canoeing swimming cliff diving snorkeling and camping out at night beneath the stars no tent just star gazing while we eventually drifted off to sleep nightly robert and i were best friends and also worked together too anyway one really really dark chilly and moonless night about pm or so we had tucked ourselves in our sleeping bags and had a really good spot elevated with no distractions to look at the night sky i had excellent vision then and could see pretty danged good i was my friend was he partook of the herb and drank beer daily and i consumed a few beers daily by nightfall we were tuckered out and wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep the heat of the west texas day really took it out of us the campsite was only accessed by boat we used a rental canoe so we paddled our way to this place that was a fairly large and very rugged rocky peninsula with some cliffs being foot high they seemed a lot taller to me we camped on the top of the cliffs at night and played down on the water by day so this one night i was looking at a particular spot up there above us and he was looking at another i then saw it and said look right there he having binoculars he looked at where i had pointed saw it and got pretty excited he finally let me look at it through his binoculars and what i saw was the following slightly larger than what we normally see a satellite was a transparent or semitransparent and faint bluish looking sphere a clear bubble really moving at a speed i remember as being slightly faster than what a satellite would be going but not so much faster or slower than any planejet traffic would be in my estimation it was going south and we watched it by passing the binoculars back and forth we both assumed it was a satellite exciting stuff but then one of us i really cant remember who noticed another one this time coming from the east they appeared to be on a course that appeared to us that would be really a close call if they were at the same altitude when they were getting a little too close for comfort at least for us the one that came from the east shot a light bluish light at the southbound sphere it wasnt laserlike at all i dont think but it appeared more like a vshaped beam from a flashlight shot at it it lasted all of a second and i am positive that it happened due to we both saw it at the same time the light flash made the southbound one turn westward now going almost the same direction as the one from the east making them both going in the same direction actually the one that got flashed didnt make a degree turn it was really going more of a path more like westsouthwest more like degrees or so just guessing now when i say that it turned it turned abruptly not at all anything like any plane would do that struck us both as being odd no curving involved at all we watched them until they both grew dim from the distance both staying in a straight line to their intended destination of course we kept thinking that the one that flashed the beam would turn and follow the other but nope i could be wrong on the speed and the directions but the rest is completely accurate the really sharp turn back then was unheard of we hear it all of the time now years ago though it wasnt talked about at all not even in the tabloids this is why this really stood out out to me all of these years that almost degree turn to be honest i just didnt understand what we had just seen we finally got to sleep that night i dont know how long it took us but we did but after a few hours around ish am robert woke me up and said listen and i heard footsteps that scared us pretty good cause we had gotten so worked up earlier i guess heheh we listened to the small branches and small gravel rocks moving beneath whatever it was that was about to kill us well we did until we finally scared ourselves to sleep i have to admit ok yeah i did partake myself but only a little bit i wasnt into it like him but i was on vacation that made us both very paranoid i guess anyway the next morning we found our bread and peanut butter missing the breads plastic wrapper was there but no bread creepy a few years later my boss who i had told all of this to and he made fun of me told me that the same thing happened to him his peanut butter and bread went missing while camped on a river they determined that it was a raccoon which they do this sort of thing i know now now to regular people that might not seem like much especially now days here on this forum more spectacular claims are made daily still for back then it was really something my older brother by years and i were camping with no tent underneath the starry sky of caddo lake in east texas around in the spring may i think and we were looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees actually talking about when we were kids looking for flying saucers thats all they were known as back then our entire family would look out at the sky in our backyard it was a common thing for us to do back in the fifties after all that was its heyday as we stared at the sky in the back of my pickup i mentioned the bluish sphere that i had seen years before at possum kingdom lake he being quiet through the entire story he wasnt that talkative really and within minutes of me mentioning this to him we saw one i had my own binoculars this time i was really amazed it was exactly as what i had seen before i mean exactly nothing major happened though it just quietly slid across the sky in front of us and disappeared behind the trees to our right and that was that my brother was never a believer anyway maybe had it landed it would change his mind we saw several regular ol satellites afterwards too why i even bring this up is that when i first started coming here around lurking i read a thread of a guy here that saw the exact thing i did with the slightly vshaped flashlight looking beam and the other blue sphere turning away id really love to read that again it was a good feeling to be somewhat confirmed i say confirmed because that friend robert that witnessed the sphere denied it in front of a lot of people at work we hardly talked about anything else on that trip and especially on the way home too assuming he felt as i did i brought it up when a bunch of guys were taking a break at work maybe people i didnt see the harm in telling what we saw after i said my piece i said ask robert robert said i was crazy and he didnt see a thing i thought he was kidding but he was being serious youd think that on the way back hed say that he wasnt wanting to tell anyone but nooo edit on by

to understand this however i need to explain the unique possibilities the nwo has created with these two candidates and how this is in fact a very old card from the s first we have trump everyone loves trump because trump is not hillary therefore he must be better it is an argument based on the following stalin killed million and one while mao killed million and two so stalin is better than mao trump is outright the lets go back to sleep candidate hillary is not already i have seen and heard more than enough about how if only trump goes in then at least four more years have been bought and the nation will survive juts four more years from the so called militia and patriots at awrm and the intelligence report they yammer that if only trump goes in then we can postpone the coming war or buy ourselves more time to prepare after all they claim time favors us not the enemy all this bearing in mind that trump has gone back on his word many times changed his mind flip flopped on illegals wants a bigger police state is the most hated in the media etc now lets compare the next runner up quickly hillary it is currently chic to hate hillary youre not in style if you like her she will end the nation doom the world and so on never mind that both trump and hillary were put up by the nwo you are not allowed to run otherwise this is old news she is going to cause more war she is a liar cheat she betrayed the nation etc yet both her and trump met with netanyahu behind closed doors and apparently received his blessing to proceed it is a trap and we should all know it and see it clearly she is also the darling of the media both of them have in common the s rise to power theme of lenin and hitler both take after these two for both nations germany and russia were in collapse or outright collapsed debauchery was the rule as well as corruption hillary is like lenin she is going in red banners flying and the cheka on her heels to remove any undesirables she is going to finish the job and push the agenda to the hilt even if it takes war to do it trump on the other hand is following hitlers script offering hope without promising anything except a bigger government more powerful police state etc trump will also see the plan to fruition but there is a subtle nuance between these two one is offering to do it with an iron fist in a velvet glove the other is simply the iron fist now comes the problem people are not seeing if they force hillary in despite all the public outrage then we know for a fact they have reached a level of preparation that is adequate to dealing with public backlash even insurrection should it be minor or full if they put trump in then they are taking the back street approach because they have not gathered the resources yet to put us down and need to put someone in who will quiet the public just like obama did for a time this election is about purchasing time nothing more nothing less if trump is put in then already we can see that most are going straight back to bed and not getting up for another four years at minimum maybe eight the militias and other patriot groups will declare a partial victory and that they can bury their guns again and whistle dixie they are mortified of having to take action so trump is their obvious choice hillary on the other hand represents that steamroller coming down the hill at full tilt they do not want that and seek to avoid it rather than fight it the reality is time does not favor us here time favors the enemy if time favored us then we would not be here diminished and in dire straits imagine how much could have been avoided had the militia stood up during waco again time favored the enemy ruby ridge time favored the enemy as they whittle away and build their power base up bit by bit they are not fools consider those two possibilities then consider this if trump goes in and goes along with the war with russia if indeed that is the plan for ww they laid out more than sixity years ago admittedly people are far more willing to join trumps army and go fight than they would hillary something else to consider is perhaps they want a second civil war put hillary in knowing it will cause an insurrection fake one which we know they can do have trump reluctantly take the reins and like davis lead the way in marching the fools single file into the enemy guns just like the first one causing mass casualties for nothing a second civil war of this sort would favor the enemy for it would absolutely end the nation but who would fight for hillary oh right thats why they are bringing in all those foreigners and foreign troops just change the uniform quickly and voila some would suggest this would favor the american nationals not really rather than fight intelligently for the bill of rights they would be fighting for trump they would be fighting to bleed us dry like the confederates did in the civil war fighting by the rules and it cost them dearly only by fighting by our own rules can we win trump would allow them to guide the slaughter one way or another all the while weakening us remember the end game is to destroy absolutely the last vestiges of americans and our culture whatever may be left of it which is not much if anything perhaps the above is where those warning about the coming breakup of america will occur perhaps perhaps not but they now have the option to do so i want you to think on all this and let your mind run wild with other possibilities but just remember that they are right now lining the ducks up you while the firing squad is forming up and loading their rifles no matter what you believe will be the outcome of this and no matter what happens one way or another know that this is all preplanned and they would never allow this situation unless they had a humdinger of a plan hidden just beneath the surface i hope i scratched that surface for you like you they have a plan a b c and d it is why they have succeeded for more than two centuries do not take them for the fool they have proven they are not so maybe we will get trump and the populace will quiet down while the communists march on with a different uniform cheka versus gestapo then again hillary might go in and just finish things and be done with it or prep the nation for the next phase no matter what happens be ready for it and do not let them sucker you into believing this honest or that trump is honest they are both in on it together they merely represent two different paths for them to reach their ultimate goal share this,0

heights in recent years giving the democratic party nominee hillary clinton an immensely influential partner on wall street as the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened fbi probe into the hillary clinton s email server case the global investment banking firm goldman sachs quietly endorsed the democratic presidential candidate this past week the financial ties that bind the clintons and wall street banks like goldman sachs are nothing new but never before have the connections been so exposed lets take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago money changers wall streets goldman sachs are inextricably linked to the clintons and the clinton foundation photo illustration wire the clintons goldman sachs while campaigning for his first term in the white house former president bill clinton received an enormous amount of support from washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on wall street at the top of the pile sat goldman sachs in the la times reported that presidential nominee bill clinton received the largest share of his financial supportat least millionfrom lawyers and lobbyists and that clinton also received additional support from big securities firms such as goldman sachs co in new york and stephens inc in his hometown of little rock ark in fact goldman sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm for decades the clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth goldman sachs and in the process a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold something that even the ny times admits over plus years goldman provided the clintons with some of their most influential advisers millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees and financial support for the family foundations charitable programs by now there should be little doubt that the clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the wall street banking cartel their relationship was built over three decades the real watershed moment came here blank check bill clinton laughs with wall street elites after signing the financial services modernization act in key to the kingdom in one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era the clinton presidency gave big banks like goldman sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely the clintongoldman sachswall street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the glasssteagall act which banking luminaries cynically named the financial services modernization act of officially titled the gramm leachbliley act the original glasssteagall was a depressionage fourpart provision under the bank act of that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the great depression in fact the grammleachbliley act which repealed glasssteagall opened the door for the shadow banking realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk as banks became more interlinked simply put clintons repeal of glasssteagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking which exposed everyone to toxic subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in all that can be laid at the feet of one william jefferson clinton and hillary still claims that my husband did so well with the economy really in a crossposted

capitol hill it was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the clinton administrations influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of glasssteagall then in in an act of corporate civil disobedience citicorp and travelers group announced they were merging such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the bank holding company act but was excused due to a loophole that provided a twoyear review period of proposed mergers the merger was premised on the expectation that glasssteagall would be repealed citigroups cochairs sandy weill and john reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of congress to make sure a deal was cut at the time it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal as stated by the former bankers of america ceo kenneth guenther in after attempts in years congress passed the financial services modernization act which led to the repeal of glasssteagall the repeal of glasssteagall was pushed heavily by citigroups coceo sanford weill and lobbyist roger levy and according to a report by the nation they laid out more than million for lobbying in according to the center for responsive politics and donated more than million in the election cyclea figure sure to be topped in how much of those contributions made their way to the clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the white house in bill clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private goldman events in after stepping down from her position as secretary of state hillary clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at goldman sachs events to the tune of dollars in which one attendee said s he sounded more like a goldman sachs managing director according

a private position on wall street reform and that it is an oversimplification to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis that clinton leak provided another window into

had a leg up on them well explore how this was done along with some new twists the criticism and selfcriticism technique in history this is what happens to people who joke about chairman mao ripping off hillarys wardrobe the technique of criticism and selfcriticism kritika i samokritika was developed during the early days of the soviet union this got results when the early soviet show trials and purges took place the targets would confess to committing treasonthe details stretching credulityand beg for execution the maoists chinese communists used it too typically during struggle sessions also forced confessions were required in vietnam for prisoners in reeducation camps what happened wasnt much different from a medieval inquisition those targeted would be badgered until they confessed to whatever it was they supposedly did of course physical forms of coercion were also an option these werent actual trials their fates were already decided the lucky ones were released and got to resume their lives as before after their memorable reminder to toe the party line others faced stiffer penalties than that from loss of party membership and accompanying status all the way up to execution no amount of compliance or abject groveling could save them if it was predetermined that they were going to be purged or killed after the ordeal survivors were surely scared witless with their egos beaten down they were ready to do as they were told without question its basically a form of brainwashing as for those who were executed after that the purpose of going through the motions was for benefit of the audience it was political theater convincing those present that they were delivering justice to wrongdoers and serving as an example of what could happen to those who step out of line other than that the criticism and selfcriticism techniquebadgering and forcing a confessionalso was picked up in the usa during the s by certain cults and oddball encounter groups today we might think of these strange and humiliating rituals as a thing of the past but the truth is that theyve merely changed form as ive noted previously cultural marxism is a crappy and inherently destructive forexport variety of communism so its no great surprise that it has adapted this technique for its purposes modern witch hunts this is what happens to people who say that bruce jenner is actually a dude when people are encouraged to become incensed over even tiny things this causes a walking on eggshells atmosphere in todays politically correct climate its easy to run afoul of the thought police this might result in a visit to the hr department or a campus speech code investigation however if the thoughtcrime is serious enoughor the target is prominent enoughthen this can ignite a media circus also someone could end up featured on a mailing list for social justice warriors besides just trolling and harassment this can result in doxxing release of your personal information or pressure on an employer to fire the thought criminal we in the western world pride ourselves on the right to free speech that was one of the main goals of liberalism back in the th century when liberalism was still a good thing actually many free countries criminalize politically incorrect speech even in places that dont have legal penalties for speaking your mind it carries the risk of the loss of your livelihood this effectively makes entire policy arguments forbidden to articulate which naturally is the whole point other goals of course are information control and thus thought control so much for freedom of speech it took a few centuries but liberals now oppose what they once stood for the following scenario has happened time and again someone points out an inconvenient truth writes something that offends someone donates to the wrong cause mocks a feminists first world problems tells an offcolor joke or even wears the wrong tshirt then the feeding frenzy begins resulting in torrents of criticism usually the target apologizes profusely but loses his job no matter how abject or groveling his apologies are its possible to convince a judge and twelve jurors that youre not guilty of something but good luck getting the media or an online sjw mob to calm down and leave you alone the traditional communist session was better in one way that is they quit after breaking the targets will a modern feeding frenzy though can drag on for months even after the target has been begging for forgiveness what goes on the internet can stay there forever including lies about you if you get caught in a social justice weenie witch hunt never apologize explain and clarify if you absolutely must this is for the benefit of the uncommitted the sjws will already have made up their small minds about you and wont stop no matter what you do never let them break your frame instead go on the attack you have a right to your own opinion and to express it if you beg for their forgiveness then you will be allowing them to turn their criticism into your selfcriticism remember that groveling is unlikely to save you apologies are for people who actually did something wrong having a difference of opinion isnt wrong despite some peoples curious notions about freedom of speech here are some other particulars to remember you cant reason with them online mobs dont know you and have been told that youre an evildoer youll probably never know exactly what was said about you who said it and what email list all that was on if you do find out sue for defamation of character however you can be sure that youve already been deemed guilty theyre not interested in the truth sjws have great difficulty comprehending basic logic many of them dont even believe in objective reality only their feelings are real to them why would the truth matter to these idiots finally social justice weenies are a bunch of losers their opinion of you matters less than that of a snotty child cursing you out therefore dont let these oxygenwasters mess with your selfesteem societal criticism and selfcriticism wallowing in guilt at its finest the frankfurt school a communist think tank that moved to the usa and began subverting the educational system developed critical theory one of their top classics was eros and civilization by herbert marcuse it contained lots of freudian arguments on how our society was too repressed and we needed to loosen up our morals another was the authoritarian personality by theodor adorno that too contained freudian mumbojumbo smearing right wing politics with accusations of neurosis and homo daddy issues all told they wrote dozens of books along those lines some attacking western civilization directly these vaporings wouldnt have amounted to much if they hadnt become trendy in academia and influenced the s zeitgeist meanwhile radical feminismthe second wavewas starting up this too had lots of communist influence another front of cultural marxism this also was all about criticism of our culture this caused friction between the sexes driving a wedge deep into the heart of society the results included the snarky snotty and spoiled attitudes youve surely encountered worse this caused untold misery from high divorce rates and broken homes this was one of several movements that became prominent during the s and are still with us today surely you can think of many others the methodology was the sameall angrily made overblown complaints about how bad society has been to them the way they tell it theyre out fighting for their rights the goal of cultural marxism though was all about attacking our morale and softening us up the people involved in those movements were merely tools being used by leaders who were in it for power money and status the educational system has been dumbed down history has been rewritten too figures like christopher columbus and the us founding fathers are bad guys now even as early as the s campuses were hellbent in purging dwems their charming term for dead white european males from the literary canon none of this was really about inclusiveness its all about robbing our people of our heritage making us ashamed of our accomplishments and destroying our resolve the propaganda is everywhere television is full of social and political messages even in shows for children and piggybacked onto advertisements too sensitivity training courses deliver politically correct indoctrination college campuses are notorious for pushing propaganda this even happens to elementary school kids my first exposure was in second grade some of the indoctrination exercises require audience participation such as forcing them to fill out privilege checklists with the facts cherrypicked to instill a sense of collective guilt all this has worked according to plan many are out of touch with their roots and dont understand that they have a heritage worth preserving worse others have been infected by guilt trips sometimes this leads to public spectacles of wallowing in guilt again theres the selfcriticism part the antidote to this is the truth the fact is every civilization has its good points and its bad points and ours is no exception its rotten hypocrisy for the bullshit merchants in academia and the media to dwell on our faults and overlook those of other parts of the world while selectively ignoring our accomplishments and elevating those of others the truth is that none of our shortcomings or misdeeds are solely found in western civilization but some of our good characteristics are indeed unique you can protect your children by home schooling them or sending them to a private school where they wont be indoctrinated you can always get rid of your tv too meanwhile though millions of other students will be putty in the hands of propagandizing professors and teachers and of course the lying media those pushing this from the top down must be called out exposed and removed from power read more common sjw arguments and how to dismantle them,0

disney cartoons and literary fiction all portray romantic love as an absolute necessity in any wedding union but how much of that narrative has been a lie is it possible that our pursuit of romantic love is actually preventing us from forming a lifelong pair bond i began to question the notion of romantic love when thinking about its emotional root love is a fleeting emotion and like all emotions it comes and goes like the clouds in the sky why have i been taught to select my life partner based on an emotion im surely not encouraged to use emotion when buying a house applying for a job or doing my personal finances but when it comes to choosing a human being that im supposed to spend the rest of my life with im advised by the establishment narrative to use emotion for the biggest decision of them all another major clue that romantic love is a childish strategy for choosing mates is the fact that countries with arranged marriages where partners are picked based on purely practical matters have lower divorce rates that in countries where romantic love is used to select mates while there are multiple reasons for divorce in any society it is rather coincidental that the countries most impacted by notions of romantic love happen to have the highest divorce rates romance was invented it turns out that your desire to use love as a precondition for marriage or pair bonding is an invented construct that had roots in destroying tradition and theistic authority romanticism a movement that began in the th century put romantic love at the forefront not just for individuals but nations as well all from a central thesis of individualism it wanted you to take the focus away from boring old rules and traditions to focusing on how you feel the movement came primarily from bourgeois youth who used family money to fiddle away on idealistic writings the romantic movement was nothing more than a protest against bourgeois conventions bourgeois society and morality to be extreme and flamboyant and unusual and violent even at the risk of becoming grotesque was the desire of every young romantic the romantics were in fact bourgeois origins who were trying hard to escape from their own shadows source romantics believed that men and women ought to be guided by warm emotions rather than the cold abstract rules and rituals established by bourgeois society source they sound a lot like modern day social justice warriors many of whom are trust fund babies that lash out against privilege and inequality to relieve the psychological pain of being wealthy without having had to earn it combined with the fact that sjws also trump feelings over logic its clear to see how romanticists were protosjws whose individualistic ideas are just what the enlightenment needed to complete its destruction of tradition romantics redefined what relationships should be based on prior to the romantic era companionate love was the relationship form often described in literature and other historical writings passionate love is the arousaldriven emotion which often gives people extreme feelings of happiness and can also give people feelings of anguish companionate love is the form which creates a steadfast bond between two people and gives people feelings of peace scientists have described the stage of passionate love as being on cocaine since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter dopamine as when cocaine is being used source besides song of songs in the old testament writers were not encouraged to muse endlessly about passionate love and there is zero evidence it was used as the principal factor in forming new marriages but its this passionate love that were told to strive for of feeling like youve been swept up in an exciting whirlwind before publishing the gory details on buzzfeed or in a bestseller like eat pray love authored by a woman who is embarking on her second divorce women of the romantic era played a big part in elevating romantic love and why wouldnt they its much more fun to get swept up in the excitement created by noncommittal alpha male than it does to do arduous daily duties before you husband king and god women were given the chance to pick between excitement or responsibility and we know what they have chosen the works of the romantic era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period the romantic period saw an increase in female authors and also female readers source the modern era has doubled down on the notion of romantic love jewish psychologist robert sternberg proposed the popular triangular theory of love which is often used today as defining the love ideal this theory has caused immense harm for stating that all three forms of love are needed in equal measure for a successful relationship anyone who takes an introductory psychology course or who reads a pop psychology book will be exposed to this theory and walk away thinking that passion is absolutely required in a relationship if its not there the presumption is that the relationship is no longer consummate and far short of ideal believing that romantic love and passion are necessary in a marriage makes it that much easier to exit out of it because when a woman no longer feels passion she will walk away knowing that experts like sternberg would agree that the relationship degraded and was no longer worth saving and this is exactly what modern women are doing in droves they have shown an appalling disregard for their wedding vows especially upon realizing that they initiate of divorces romanticism and the rise of nationalism if nationalism came out of the romantic era and passionate love was a mistake does that mean nationalism is also a mistake one of romanticisms key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism which became a central theme of romantic art and political philosophy from the earliest parts of the movement with their focus on development of national languages and folklore and the importance of local customs and traditions to the movements that would redraw the map of europe and lead to calls for selfdetermination of nationalities nationalism was one of the key vehicles of romanticism its role expression and meaning patriotism nationalism revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period source upon closer inspection its easy to see that the ruling agenda of today globalism is essentially world nationalism instead of loving your neighbor and only those who share your unique traditions or race youre supposed to love everyone in the world because its evil to think that there are large differences between a german businessman in a hugo boss suit and a tutsi villager with a lip plate the size of a grapefruit the romantic ideal of nationalism is not adolph hitler but george soros who insists on loving everyone in the world from the depths of your heartfelt human compassion a nationalism based on genetics and local bonds will no doubt serve citizens better than a global nationalism where youre supposed to care for those who are nothing like you how should men choose their life partners its clear that using romantic love and passion as your primary standard for longterm relationships will lead to failure and maybe even personal catastrophe youll easily come to this conclusion by evaluating your past relationships and the mistakes youve made on women who you had intense passion for instead practicality must be the order of the day you must logically evaluate any woman you intend to be with for more than a casual relationship by weighing her values beliefs and sexual history this is easier said than done because weve been so brainwashed to believe passion is important but it simply makes the most amount of sense find a woman the same way you would find a new job or buy a new house and be wary of women who picked you based more on passion than practical matters it may sound cold to search for your wife like you would a business partner but that is exactly what she is the daytoday life of a family home is far more business and economics than love and so you should come to the easy conclusion that thats what you must use to form a stable home understand however that we do not live in a traditional and patriarchal society that aids us in our search for a virtuous woman instead society is encouraging women to corrupt themselves sexually and physically in the name of empowerment and independence making our search exceedingly difficult this is one of the costs we have to pay for living in the modern world some men will be able to overcome it but many men wont and will fail in their search for a woman they can create a family with but at least we are now armed with the knowledge of what it takes to have a more successful longterm relationship its not romantic love or butterflies in the stomach but a matter of practicality logically evaluate her past her values and her beliefs to make sound predictions of how shell behave in the future from this evaluation will come a logical decision that is likely to endure instead of relying on emotion which changes as readily as the direction of the wind read more unconditional love from a woman is impossible,1

tags war on women democrats campaign tactic naturalnews single women are a crucial element of the democrat constituency pushed to the polls with a crude combination of scare tactics and pandering that would be comical if it wasnt so effective in election after election we may pause to remark that republicans should have been much more prepared for this in but we should also look back to because it was used in regardless of how absurd it was to suggest mitt romney was leading a war on womenarticle written by john howard republished from breitbartcom even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity given the emergence of strange new respect for romney this year of course this new respect is pure political opportunism and dont be surprised to hear liberals complaining in future election that the conservative republican presidential candidate isnt as candid and relaxed about social issues as donald trump was in the good old days of we should practice a little political opportunism of our own and put the lefts revised opinion of romney to good use what they said about him was absurd in almost every respect theyve wholeheartedly embraced his position on the geopolitical threat of russia which means theyre tacitly admitting barack obama didnt know what the hell he was talking about they razz trump about not paying enough taxes but they didnt care a whit that romney paid stupendous amounts of tax plus vast charitable contributionsmost pertinently they turned mitt romney into a misogynist clod and his wife ann romney into an outoftouch stepford wife on the thinnest of pretexts lefty polemicists today are acting like they were possessed by political demons when they spent the final weeks of the campaign shrieking about binders full of women and now they cant quite remember what they were going on aboutas for mrs romney she was unceremoniously stripped of her feminine identity by liberals and treated like a space alien because she dared to endorse stayathome motherhood when a mild backlash ensued the white house memorably denied one of its slander ninja by claiming to know several different people with the same name in the democrat imagination and campaign ads republicans are constantly targeting american woman you can draw a straight line from anita hills hit on clarence thomas in the nineties to journalist george stephanopoulos ambushing the republican presidential field with a bizarre question about contraceptives in the primaryits all pure opportunism not principle romney was a choirboy so they claimed his policies revealed his secret inner misogynist beast trumps policies include a familyleave plan a culturewar ceasefire declared by peter thiel at the gop convention and an unease with lateterm abortion that tracks with the majority of the country theres precious little that could be twisted into a war on women narrative even by the people who used sandra fluke to portray spending ten bucks on contraceptives as the equivalent of female slavery therefore the left ignores trumps policies and hits his character while bill freakin clinton gets ready to move back into the white housein the nineties democrats argued that clintons sexual abuses had nothing to do with how he governed so discussing them was a silly distraction we all needed to moveonorg from even when he was in the dock for perjury liberals of that election cycle laughed out loud at the notion bill clintons libido had any effect whatsoever on national policy he was good for the abortion industry so his treatment of actual women was irrelevantpartisan feminism is at a strange crossroads as the core feminist message of independence clashes with victim politics women are supposed to simultaneously feel strong capable and be utterly helpless before systemic male chauvinism they can only achieve personal independence through total dependence on the big government which is staffed and managed by the only men in america who supposedly arent looking to exploit them youre not to think about the bureaucrats who keep getting caught surfing for pornography on government computers the great leftwing project to rewire society

and the electorate feels like a battered nfl fan the game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage democrats can be counted upon to call the republican opponent racist whether the opponent is the priestly mitt romney or the supreme court justice who wrote the dred scott decision donald trump you see is racist because among other reasons at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my africanamerican hillary clinton on the other hand is not antisemitic even though three witnesses one of whom took and passed a polygraph claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a fing jew bastard with a republican candidate the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies big or small real or imagined while giving the democrat a pass so trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of clintons flatout lie during the third debate when she insisted that the supreme court heller case was about toddlers as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms in heller nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear clinton a year ago flatout said the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment to normal people this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on which again was whether we as individuals have a right to keep and bear arms meanwhile we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal when the accurate description is national security scandal the espionage act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters the law does not require as fbi director james comey falsely stated an intent nor is it relevant as clinton insists whether or not her private server the one she maintained in her basement was hacked five people who worked with or for clinton including her chief of staff all received immunity deals something normally given to get someone to flip on a target some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed but the target that is to say hillary clinton was deemed by comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted so why the immunity deals who knows and as far as most of the media are concerned who cares clinton insists that president obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy this would be the economy in which for the first time in history a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least percent growth in gross domestic product this would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that gallup ceo jim clifton calls the big lie given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are underemployed meanwhile its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed groped touched or made fun of by trump has appeared with her attorney feminist gloria allred allred a clinton supporter sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of trumps sexual misconduct and her support for clinton who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers one such accuser juanita broaddrick claims not only that she was raped by bill clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape hillary clinton verbally threatened her hillary clinton mind you has never been asked by anyone in the media about broaddricks allegation never and only one national reporter sam donaldson has ever asked bill clinton about juanita broaddricks allegation ever clintons answer he referred donaldson to his lawyer david kendall donaldson quickly tried again asking the thenpresident to simply deny it same answer my attorney speaks for me and that was that so hillary clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since who has clearly violated the espionage act and placed the nations security at risk who told the benghazi victims families that the death of four americans was inspired by a video while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different whose charitable foundation engaged in paytoplay in haiti so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and nondonors went to the back of the line who wants to gut the second amendment who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of isis russia and the

marxismthe election of donald trump to the presidency of the united states like many of you i was outside with my fellow tribesmen the same tribe our opponents tried to shut down in february until about am on election day as you may expect it was a joyous occasion that ill never forget yet as i remarked at the time while this was a glorious victory a decisive one that ended the campaign the war would continue i had hoped to be as magnanimous as possible in victory to finally bridge some divides and begin to move past the insanity weve been dealing with thats accelerated in the past few years however as has quickly become apparent the cultural marxists sjws and their globalist overlords have no intention of coming to terms or engaging in meaningful selfreflection anytime soon instead theyre doubling down on everything that voters resoundingly rejected on november th predictably there have been protests and some riots incidents of violence on the left have taken place and gone underreported just as predictably most of these protests are professionally organized with george soros likely pulling at least a few of the strings learning nothing the regressive leftists taking to the streets complete with their year zero pathology think themselves morally justified in blocking streets and attacking people because theyre on a mission to purify society anything that stands in the way of that mission can be justly eliminated i came across one of these protests a few days ago it was generic and small basic bitch shit really but recall that these are merely the peons in the army of their overlords their intensity will dissipate with time the safetypin wearing safespace occupying neonhaired freaks arent the ones to take note of on the grand strategic map the bigger picture to focus on is the drive toward increased censorship in the past few days the recent counteroffensive began with the uproar over donald trumps selection of steve bannon to be his chief white house strategist the media and its acolytes on social media went into another coordinated attack lambasting bannon and breitbart which he ran as having connections to the altright which in turn they say is associated with white nationalism to reinforce this pairing the media ran with a couple of the most controversial breitbart headlines if you recognize this tactic its because the media ab tested this against roosh in february they took the how to stop rape headline said that it proved that roosh was prorape and then repeated endlessly this is actually a sort of hypnosis trick and was certainly done deliberately scott adams calls this wordthinking rational people use data and reason to arrive at truth this group is mostly imaginary wordthinkers use labels word definitions and analogies to create the illusion of rational thinking this group is of the world persuaders use simplicity repetition emotion habit aspirations visual communication and other tools of persuasion to program other people and themselves this group is about of the population and effectively control the wordthinkers of the world he further describes the phenomenon of wordthinking wordthinking is important to persuasion because if you can convince someone to accept a label on an opponent it turns off their critical thought and turns on their confirmation bias nuance is lost context is lost all that matters once the label is accepted is whatever qualities the label already contained and this is what the media is doing they did it with roosh and are now doing their damndest to do it to bannon no doubt as one of the thousand paper cuts they hope to use to take president trump down because the term altright is relatively fresh its vulnerable to being defined with the most ominous dark terms possible which is why the media is trying furiously to create as much connective tissue between it and white nationalism as possible remember with wordthinking nuance and context are lost and now that this first step has been achieved where it was meant to the selfanointed moral cover for the more alarming stage of the counteroffensive is underway now that the ambiguous and ominoussounding altright has been attempted to be extensively defined the solution is obviously to crack down on it and anyone having to do with it even if they really dont given this pretext the purges and censorship have begun with numerous prominent twitter accounts being suspended agree with these accounts or not i often dont it should give you pause that this kind of blanket censorship is being implemented if youre just a little bit politically unorthodox youre now at heightened risk of being slapped with the altright label even if youre on record as not identifying with it and banned from outlets of communication that are both vital for pushing your ideas forward and for promoting any business you have but banning individuals is only stage one stage two is the recent drive by google facebook twitter and others to censor what they call fake news the media has been on a blitz against these fake news articles completely unironically given that this is the same crowd that uncritically signal boosted the rolling stone rape hoax to the ends of the world fact checks donald trumps comment that hillary clinton acid washed her private email server selectively edits clips to promote the narrative that their pets in black lives matter are entirely peaceful when they arent and fails to disclose contacts and relationships with officials of the democratic national committee while writing about the campaign no this is not the onion while this drive deserves to be a subject of laughter we must nevertheless still take it seriously there have already been reports of shadow bans on twitter with prominent figures such as mike cernovich and scott adams and its far from out of the question that a blacklist of sorts gets put up for outlets such as return of kings which were crucial in taking control of the narrative during the campaign all the while the media continues to nitpick inflate and manufacture anything they can turn into a controversy about the incoming trump administration narrative warfare is far from over what can we do fortunately we have a master persuader in donald trump to lead the way but we at the grassroots the grunts in the trenches if you will must continue our efforts first we need to begin to dehypnotize those that can be scott adams had some thoughts on that but here are the crucial points the basis of the hypnosis in recent days has been around pairing the terms altright and fake news with all sorts of bad things take away that pairing and youve made significant inroads ive ab tested this sort of thing numerous times remember mike cernovichs maxim that conflict is attention and attention is influence here are a few pointers just like with women frame control is paramount the inevitable tactic that theyll try to use is to associate anyone opposed to them with the worst elements of their side fortunately our opponents have arguably worse elements given their blanket of moral superiority and cultural influence refocus the frame on those make them own their own worst elements appeal to vanity most people like to think of themselves as rational tell them that their wordthinking is literally shutting down their critical thinking skills i did this with a girl after the first debate explaining to her that because the movie in her head pictured a mexican in a certain way her critical thinking skills turned off and that what trump said about the mexican judge would be equally applicable to someone of another heritage like german its a long story but her face was a picture tell them that theyre seeing things not based on reality but on the movies playing in their heads triggered by a certain word then watch the cognitive dissonance come on the broader level heres what we can do continue on as usual continue to make a cultural impact get those websites books movies and so on out there echoing what one member of the forum said politics is air cover culture is the ground war they can try to censor fake news all they want but we are too numerous to control if we dont cooperate its now time to redouble our efforts dont talk to any aggrieved victimhood class on social media if theyre acting hostile to you theyll use any excuse to ban you law disdain things you cannot have ignoring them is the best revenge begin to build new networks gab is up and coming and is far more free speech friendly i will echo what many others have said on the forum make fun of them theyre a prime target for humor believe me when i say most people are sick of the special snowflakes on the street as well as the media this is a time of great opportunity but we need to readjust for the new moves our opponents are making theyre doing everything they can to censor us and delegitimize trump thats the next focus of the campaign we must delegitimize them in turn but take heart that were now in the ascendant otherwise they wouldnt be making these moves i recall when i first visited return of kings and the forum nearly four years ago there was a general malaise in the atmosphere day after day it seemed we were suffering another defeat no longer what a ride its been read next reasons why you should apply for a job in the trump administration,1

struggle will european workers lie down and accept this imposture what concrete policies would weaken the stranglehold of corporations over european workers which parties in the current political landscape hold policies which if implemented would weaken the transatlantic stranglehold there are currently no political parties running in the major european elections with candidates who genuinely represent workers interests but there are some political movements which threaten the corporate powerelite we will mention them below there are two important geopolitical processes to consider here the first is the eastwest corporate geopolitical axis america is pulling the european peninsula away from the eurasian continent with the installation of a neonazi regime in kiev washington attempted to recreate an intermarium from the baltic sea to the black sea and down to the eastern mediterranean driving a permanent wedge between russia and germany in order to facilitate the social transformation of europe into a america minor millions of pilgrims are necessary hence the deployment of coercive engineered migration as a tool to replace class conscious european workers with deracine youths in some instances educated enough to do the lowpaid work assigned to them and acculturated enough to pose no problem to the powerelite in the new trotskyite language of this imperial order any leader who attempts to stem the tide of globalisation through populist appeals to tradition and national identity is fascist fascist is a loaded term which generally connotes evil in the public mind in each european country there is a readymade army of youths from wealthy families whose job is to don hoddies attack police and scream fascist and racist at workingclass people desperately trying to find a way out of this nightmare these antifa are the modern equivalent to oswald mosleys fascist gangs in the s they represent the same class interests pettybourgeois leftism is the new world orders avantgarde a favourite passtime of the antifa mob is throwing stones at police officers one can only gain acceptance in the antifascist gang by showing how much one hates the pigs so police officers from honest workingclass families get burned alive while the antifa mob chants slogans from the spanish civil war such violence is now a regular occurrence in demonstrations the agents provocateurs often receive help from the intelligence services french police are finding it hard to cope with the chaos developing all over french suburbs they complain that they are not sufficiently equipped and do not have the powers necessary to deal with the growing violence from delinquents they have been demonstrating in paris they have been calling for an end to the control of the french police by free masonry exacerbating the problem is the deepseated racism of many police officers who target black youths with spotchecksm very often without reason the recent demonstrations by french police in france against poor working conditions and low pay strongly suggests that there is the possibility that the rank and file of the french police could be waking up to the reality that france is government by a criminal gang after the magnanville terrorist attack in june where two police officers were killed a police officer at the funeral of the deceased refused to shake the hand of president hollande and prime minister manuel valls it was a highly significant act of insubordination the police who in capitalist societies are the guardians of the ruling class are beginning to realise the criminality of the people they are protecting they are perhaps beginning to understand that the role of the state is to impose the dictatorship of one class over another that of the minority of super wealthy over the labouring masses many of these dissident police officers are linked to le pens national front a reliable source in french intelligence informed me that the secret services spend more time watching the farright than the socalled far left they see the far right as a real potential danger to the ruling order whereas the far left present no danger but are in fact a key component of ruling class ideology from the arab spring to nuit debout the farleft are the lifeblood of capitalism the potential of a major split between the national and compradore bourgeoise of imperial states for prospects of workingclass gains is something that needs more study what should we make of all this in the context of ceta as i have said on numerous occasions the far right in france are and always have been political opportunists who exploit the despair of the masses they serve the interests of the national bourgeoisie but the national front are regularly denounced by the media not for being right wing rather they are dismissed as being closer to the far left the prospect of raising workers salaries nationalisation of key industries and a halt on the importation of cheap labour appeal to workingclass families as i have pointed out before looking at a debate between the trotskyist jeanluc melanchon and marine le pen in one would have thought that le pen was was the leftist and melanchon the rightwing militarist melanchon shamelessly defended the nato bombing campaign of libya while le pen opposed it civil war on the horizon the rightwing presidential candidate philippe de villiers has said there are plans afoot to divide the french territory between muslims and nonmuslims he quote s francois hollandes own writings to back up his claims everyone is talking about an imminent civil war in the bars and cafes of paris one can hear more and more disgruntled french citizens talking about media disinformation the demonisation of russia the homogenisation of thought and the criminality of the ruling class the scene has never been more propitious to a populist take over of french politics but one should not have illusions about the national front they are following the menacious zionist narrative on the war on terror muslims are the problem the partys vicepresident forian philippot is close to the ultrazionist lawyer gilleswilliam goldnagel a friend of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu philippot recently condemned the comments of presidential candidate jean frédéric poisson who said hillary clinton presented the greatest threat for the world as she is in the pay of the zionists poisson was subsequently forced to kneel before the representative council of jewish institutions in france crif where he sought forgiveness he was told he would be forgiven but they they would never forget in spite of the national fronts antimuslim bias an increasing number of muslims are voting for the party many muslims prefer the national front as they are sick and tired of being patronised and manipulated by the left with their pseudo antiracism and humanitarian wars there have also been major strikes by police in ireland for similar reasons to france french workers are losing everything and will soon become a lumpen proletariat meanwhile the french government has programmes in place to encourage migrants heading to britain to stay in france the socialist party is creating a new electorate it is a wise move for them because after the next election abstentionism will be the norm and the indigenous lumpen proletariat will resent the migrants the oligarchs will keep the masses in bondage through gmos takfiri antiislam and total reification of life ceta is the beginning of the end for social hope it is the prelude to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip the most evil trade deal in history french vicepresident of the trilateral commission herve de carmoy wrote a book in entitled leuramerique euramerica where he argues for the formation of what amounts to a transatlantic superstate run by a financial oligarchy ceta is the prelude to that project,0
