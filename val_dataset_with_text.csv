Larsen Halleck,how effective are books on fitness,"home  badge abuse  cop caught on his own body camera stealing money from unconscious crash victim cop caught on his own body camera stealing money from unconscious crash victim matt agorist november    comment 
denver co  a denver cop has been arrested and suspended without pay after his own body camera footage caught him stealing  in cash from a crash victim 
instead of helping an unconscious crash victim officer julian archuleta took advantage of the situation for his own personal gain by going through the mans clothing and robbing him archuleta now faces charges of misdemeanor theft stdegree official misconduct and tampering with physical evidence 
according to an arrest affidavit archuleta responded to a call of shots fired in the early morning hours of october  the call then led to a short pursuit which ended as the car crashed the driver got away while the passenger of the vehicle was knocked unconscious 
archuletas body camera then recorded the officer for the next  minutes and  seconds in the footage he took pictures of the scene and then searched the mans clothing which had been removed by paramedics 
in the video archuleta finds a stack of cash in the mans pants with a  bill on top according to the arrest affidavit he then separates the  bill from the stack and a  bill remains on top 
throughout the footage archuleta shuffles money and rearranges paperwork in his patrol car the affidavit said 
according to the denver post when a detective collected the cash and logged it into the property bureau as evidence he counted  and did not find any  bills the affidavit said but while reviewing archuletas body camera footage as part of the investigation the detective noticed the  bill 
amazingly enough instead of covering up the theft the detective crossed the thin blue line and reported the inconsistency with the  bill to internal affairs when confronted by investigators archuleta told them he would check his war bag to see if any of the money had slipped into a crevice in his patrol car 
according to the arrest affidavit archuleta called the detective back an hour later and claimed he found   bills that must have fallen in his bag after being caught redhanded archuleta then turned in the money 
according to the post the denver district attorneys office declined to prosecute the shooting suspect because of the missing cash and because archuleta allegedly moved evidence inside the suspects vehicle before detectives had a search warrant the affidavit said 
earlier this year the denver police department was equipped with body cameras we now know why it took so long for the department to adopt them archuleta will now go down in history as the first denver cop to be criminally charged based on body camera evidence 
like most cases of police theft this incident is not isolated in fact just  months ago grants police department sgt roshern c mckinney  was arrested after an investigation found that hed stolen both money and marijuana from the police department like archuleta he entire theft was captured on the officers own body camera mckinney has since been charged with marijuana distribution conspiracy and felony embezzlement 
state police also charged mckinneys yearold girlfriend tanicka gallegosgonzales for drug distribution and conspiracy both were arrested in albuquerque and booked into the sandoval county detention center according to kob 
public information officer for the new mexico state police elizabeth armijo said grants police chief craig vandiver alerted state police after the department found video from mckinneys lapel camera that exposed possible illicit activity by a grants police department sergeant 
what does it say about the criminal tendency of some police officers when they are unable to practice restraint from theft  knowing that they are being recorded share google  the kali whrite boi 
ok am not cool with corrupt criminal cops but still this msm puppet is infuriating this civilian was fleeing a scene of shots fired leading the cop in a short chase before crashing

    donald trump speaking at the  conservative political action conference cpac in national harbor maryland credit gage skidmore  flickr
trumps victory was a shock to most especially given the broad support hillary clinton received from the forces of wall street although trump is a billionaire himself his criticism of free trade agreements and us policy toward russia angered a broad section of the ruling class it is the ruling class in control of the banks military institutions and corporate boardrooms that usually determine elections in the united states trumps victory is a product of the ruling systems decline and crisis more than anything else the question is now what
what is urgently needed is a deep investigation of all aspects and contradictions of the trump moment first trump won because the capitalist system is in crisis the laws of the system have inevitably led to such a level of concentration that profit accumulation has turned into its opposite technological innovation has permanently replaced a large section of labor in the us creating the deindustrialized terrain trump spoke so much about in his campaign at the end of the day the profits that wall street speculated into the ground ultimately came from the compulsion to increase buying power with large debt schemes that could never be paid back by a working class whose wages have been in decline for over three decades 
so when hillary clinton decided to campaign as some sort of united front against fascism few listened many people in the us saw clinton as an extension of the ruling establishment that had pummeled working class people into the ground the black lives matter movement exposed her complicity in the crime legislation that led to the vast expansion of the black prisoner population during her husbands rule hillary clinton then made the mistake of coalescing with the ruling establishments of both parties in hopes of isolating trump when in fact she merely exposed her role as a loyal servant of power
some have claimed that since clinton won the popular vote she was the rightful winner regardless of her flaws others have argued that the republican party rightwing elites rigged the election  however true there will be no recall this time around why the dnc and the clinton campaign rigged the primaries in order to defeat sanders in a stunning shift of political legitimacy the democratic party has eviscerated all difference between itself and its republican party counterparts
numerous pieces have been written about the dangers of the cabinet trump will select indeed trumps possibilities do not deviate from the standard republican party makeup his potential choices for top positions include tough on crime rudy giuliani austerity magnate chris christie and privatization enthusiast newt gingrich however for the first time in a long time the president of the united states is accountable to something other than the ruling class in the past republican party and democratic party presidents dutifully served its paymasters while using manipulation to ensure that their respective bases were effectively neutralized
more defeating white liberalism in the age of trump brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it this is not the case with trump just a month ago trump was the least desired choice of the ruling class  it was trumps petty bourgeois and working class base of white america that propelled him to victory it is clear that the need to politically survive in hostile waters will compel trump to choose a neocon administration but a neocon agenda is exactly what his supporters voted against even those who directly or indirectly ascribe to white american nationalism are sick of endless war and austerity however nothing less can be expected from the likes of chris christie and newt gingrich
the contradictions of the trump era will breed a social confrontation between classes not seen since the great depression white liberals and white nationalists will battle for the soul of the twoparty system the neocon establishment will have to confront trumps foreign and economic policy campaign rhetoric much of which is in direct antagonism with the gops record and the democratic party will attempt to use the age of trump as a time to regroup and steer the forces of resistance back into its camp
how should the forces of resistance position themselves under this new set of conditions first the antiwar left needs to confront trumps foreign policy head on and place pressure on him to make good on his promises to scale back nato and its escalation toward russia the left needs to resist any and all attempts by trump to make good on some of his less savory proposals such as a the deportation of the million immigrants and the expansion of the us nuclear arsenal of course trumps rhetoric must be placed in its proper context it was the obama administration that signed a one trillion dollar agreement to modernize the us nuclear arsenal and deported nearly three million immigrants in eight years a number unseen in us history this means resistance to the trump administrations use of the apparatus that obama and the democrats built should be directed at the entire ruling class not just one of the two parties that represent it
the vast majority of people simply cannot afford the resurrection of the twoparty system as don debar of cpr news has made clear the check of white supremacy simply doesnt pay the same dividends anymore while the wealth gap between white america and black american would take over two centuries to even out  it is also true that merely ten percent white america owns almost all wealth in the us  capitalisms crisis has forced a large segment of the population to live under working class conditions a unique opportunity exists to build and strengthen a radical left agenda in the us and a start a discussion of what it will take to implement it
what is meant by opportunity is that a narrow outlook on this moment will breed narrow results it should be imperative that the left force trumps hand on foreign policy it should demand that trump use his executive powers to force through a st century glasssteagall act and create a federal jobs program to rebuild infrastructure in the us the left should not hesitate to condemn and protest whatever white supremacist and repressive policies come out of his administration with full recognition that it was democratic and republican party consensus that got us here as emotions run high and fear captures a number of people completely disenchanted with the current political climate in the united states the time has come to spend the time and effort necessary to prepare the people for the war that existed long before trump class war",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,5.169608718030007,84,10,6886,1153,4.962705984388552,1153.0,0.6738979064645144,-0.0141271790859303,1.03373507719519,1.029581099516618,-0.1247602984449437,1.0652497208704783,0.0034692107545533,0.0,0.0,0,3,0.0,0.0077545327718914,0.9886,0.124,0.087,0.789,Positive,Very Strong

Daniel Greenfield,what will replace isis,"the muslim bloc may have won the battle but did israel win the war october   ari lieberman 
by now it should be clear to all but the blindest or rabidly disingenuous that the united nations is an organization that has been coopted by the nefarious interests of muslim nations and their despotic third world allies it is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy an organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as todays greatest purveyor of judeophobia historical revisionism and conspiracy theories this fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco that deny the indisputable jewish nexus to the holy city 
on april  the member body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly onesided resolution that referred to jewish holy sites in jerusalem exclusively by their muslim names and designated the temple mount judaisms holiest site as a muslim holy site of worship to add insult to injury the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that israel was planting jewish fake graves in other spaces of the muslim cemeteries 
unsurprisingly the resolution which was submitted by seven muslim nations passed by a wide margin with  votes in favor six against and  abstentions two nations were absent for the vote france sweden slovenia and spain shamefully supported the vile resolution 
that the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of muslim and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of unesco but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner european support and israel could thus claim a moral victory france with its collaborationist past and proclivity to kowtow to the worlds despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble 
but following the vote a crack appeared in the façade of antiisrael invective so prevalent at the un it appeared that france was having a case of buyers remorse in an address to the french parliament prime minister manuel valls termed the resolution clumsy and unfortunate he then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that france will never deny the jewish presence and jewish history in jerusalem it would make no sense it is absurd to deny this history 
france is one of europes strongest advocates for the palestinians the palestinian authority and their muslim allies at unesco should have understood from valls statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic european support instead of declaring victory and moving on they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in october 
the october  resolution  sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the april resolution it condemned israel for various contrived transgressions and again severed the jewish and christian nexus to the city this time however the muslim bloc was in for a rude awakening while the resolution passed the muslim bloc was unable to garner a majority in the member body 
of the  nations that voted in favor of the resolution mexico later withdrew support lowering the final tally to   were composed of states with muslim majorities while a fifteenth nigeria is  percent muslim making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion what was notable was the fact that this time around the resolution failed to garner a single western european concurrence other developing nations like india which had hitherto supported arabsponsored drafts also abstained israels behindthescenes political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the muslim initiative was paying dividends 
following the resolutions passage the palestinians and their muslim allies suffered additional political reversals mexico  asked for a revote because it wished to withdraw support for the motion mexicos secretariat of foreign affairs said in a statement that his governments changed position reiterates the recognition that the government of mexico gives the undeniable link of the jewish people to the cultural heritage of east jerusalem 
brazil soon followed suit echoing mexicos position in a statement the brazilian government noted that it would no longer support such onesided resolutions italy which had abstained went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future prime minister matteo renzi told an italian radio station that these resolutions were incomprehensible unacceptable and wrong he added that to say that the jews have no links to jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness 
even unescos directorgeneral irina bokova voiced disapproval by stating that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city she later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion 
on wednesday the palestinian authority and jordan introduced a third draft resolution to unescos world heritage committee seeking to generate further political terrorism the proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the jewish nexus to the city and its holy sites the member whc body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise move croatia and tanzania asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the muslim bloc instead of the motion passing by consensus the vote was  in favor two opposed eight abstentions and one nation absent 
the two nations opposing were tanzania and the philippines of the  ayes seven were muslim it was a pyrrhic victory at best 
given the large number of muslim countries represented at the un and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against israel it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed but as evidenced by recent arab political reversals gone are the days that the palestinians can rely on automatic european and nonaligned support 
israel has been effectively reaching out to the socalled nonaligned nations and it is having a significant positive impact part of the israeli success lies in the fact that the jewish state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water technology agriculture energy counterterrorism cyber warfare and arms this outreach has translated to political dividends at the un 
nevertheless the unesco resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many un member states it also underscores the need for the united states to maintain its commitment and assurance to israel that it will never allow the un to impose terms and dictates on israel 
there have been rumors circulating that barack obama in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on israel utilizing the un security council the white house has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation 
the administrations objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed antiisrael resolution likely introduced by france or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto in addition to betraying longstanding commitments to israel and running counter to strong bipartisan opposition the notion that the united states would throw israel under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant antisemitism to have a say on israels fate is beyond asinine hopefully the outrageous conduct exhibited at unesco steers the administration in the right direction",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,22,4,7561,1198,5.285475792988314,1198.0,-1.221754532806611,-1.141531470845462,1.2123209541200506,1.1001267350694888,0.1937818483974835,1.1374446857094451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.871,0.137,0.125,0.738,Positive,Very Strong

Caroline Glick,checkmating obama,"search zineb el rhazoui charlie hebdo survivor discusses why the world needs to destroy islamic fascism undeterred by fatwas and death threats the author has released an incendiary and thoughtful new book bound to provoke debate october   
reprinted from nytimescom 

she leads a clandestine existence on the move and under hour guard as frances most protected woman yet zineb el rhazoui the charlie hebdo journalist who happened to be in casablanca on january  last year the day terrorists avenging the prophet massacred nine people at the satirical magazine in paris believes she has a duty to defy islamists desperate to silence her 
shaken but undeterred by the fatwas and relentless precise death threats issued via social media to kill the bitch since she helped produce the publications first survivors issue following the attack  and spoke about it in arabic for the arab press  the moroccanfrench writer refuses to assume an anonymous identity fleeing paris or abandoning her human rights activism and her unforgiving critiques of the religion she grew up with are also out of the question 
i dont have the right to renounce my struggle or to give up my freedom says the reporter and sociologist of religion in an interview with women in the world during a recent trip to new york as part of french president francois hollandes delegation when he received the appeal of conscience foundations world statesman award for  if the french state protects me it is not little individual me what is being protected is my freedom to be irreverent and freedom of expression so i should exercise this even more because i enjoy this protection 
its totally crazy i have done nothing against the law and have nothing to hide yet i live with security while those who threaten us are free el rhazoui declares with an air of shock and anger that underscores the arbitrariness and brutality visited on a yearold woman condemned to living on the run and mostly in the shadows and if you call them by their names you are islamophobic and racist i am racist i can teach them a few things about arab culture i can show them how to discover its richness and the diversity of their culture i believe this culture deserves universality because you can be arab muslim and a free thinker 
resisting terror 
sweeping in to the offices of women in the world in manhattan accompanied by bodyguards the worldrenowned journalist is living proof of her pledge to keep living her life beyond its limits as a key way of resisting terror elegant and beautiful with her long wavy hair flowing freely and in an impeccably tailored black dress el rhazoui is reminiscent of s cinemas cerebral heroines  her eloquence and composure only occasionally betraying the trauma of the past  months each time we speak about the aftermath of the massacre at her magazine and how she is coping personally her voice quavers but when the subject comes back to her fight for reform in islamic civilization she is fearless 
in this spirit el rhazoui obliged to spend most of her time in hiding like salman rushdie after his  publication of the satanic verses  has taken the highrisk option of publishing an explosive new book about islam 
detruire le fascisme islamique  destroy islamic fascism  being released in france this week takes the battle of ideas directly to the ideologicallydriven zealots who inspired the assassins of her dear friend charb stephane charbonnier late editor of charlie hebdo who preferred to die standing than to live on my knees 
obtained exclusively by women in the world the book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam by imitating the first salafists or pious ancestors the prophet mohammed and his companions whose violent exploits are contained in bellicose texts from a barbaric thcentury bedouin tribal context exhibited codes of behavior el rhazoui insists have no place in the modern world and can be directly connected to terrorism the most abject crimes of islamic state are but a stcentury remake of what the first muslims accomplished under the guidance of the prophet she writes noting that sexual and domestic slavery the massacre of nonmuslims notably jews pedophilia pillage polygamy and summary executions were all adopted from preislamic societies the book is also the journalists way of carrying on the legacy of her dead comrades who reveled in their right to mock established religion and fanatics everywhere  with islam no exception to their traditional french anticlerical ridicule  through satire and caricature 
formerly the magazines religion writer el rhazoui is in the throes of joining the exodus of staff breaking from the magazine under its new management flush with cash from international donations the fundamentally altered publication she disappointedly explained  will probably never again draw the prophet  out of fear of more reprisals 
and those who think that only a handful of madmen are capable of killing for a cartoon of mohammed forget that everywhere that islam reigns as the religion of the state caricatures and cartoons in the press are repressed el rhazouis book dedicated to muslim atheists is an unapologetic strike against the strict application of islam religion of peace and love 
we need to admit that islamism today is applied islam el rhazoui  who describes herself as an atheist of muslim culture writes responding to politicians religious figures islamophobia opponents and media commentators who claim after every jihadist attack that real islam has nothing to do with such terror 
when we apply islam to the letter it gives islamism and when we apply islamism to the letter it gives terrorism so we need to stop saying islam is a religion of peace and love what is a moderate islamist an islamist who doesnt kill 
the essaylength book is in the grand french polemical tradition of emile zola whose jaccuse denounced the antisemitism of the french state and establishment during the dreyfus affair on the eve of the th century el rhazoui who holds moroccan and french citizenship takes aim at a very stcentury phenomenon what she abhors as the intellectual fraud of islamophobia which pretends to be about antiracism but in her reckoning is used as a weapon to silence all critics of islam and the ideas behind it as automatically hostile towards all muslims epitomized by the french collective against islamophobia ccif this deliberate strategy vilifies as islamophobic voices such as el rhazouis who dare question the religion the ccif and fellow travelers define only through the prism of their own fundamentalism 
the notion of islamophobia doesnt even exist in muslim countries the author points out because outside the west criticism of the religion or mohammed is officially categorized as blasphemy 
unable to pass blasphemy laws in europe groups like the ccif employ a dangerous semantic confusion she said on the ccif site it is written islamophobia is not an opinion it is an offense 
this is very dangerous because it has even entered the dictionary as hostility towards islam and muslims yet criticism of an idea of islam or of a religion cannot be characterized as an offense or a crime i was born and lived under the islam of morocco and live in france and i have the right criticize religion and this dictatorship of islamophobia that says i have no right to criticize if we criticize christianity it doesnt mean we are christianophobes or racist towards the christian race 
the widespread pressure to selfcensor is severe el rhazoui says 
you can no longer speak about islam without saying its a religion of peace and love but when you open any book in islam what do you find violence blood oppression of women and hate for other religions 
of course you can find this in other religions however we are talking about something written many centuries ago during a barbaric time for humanity as long as we dont talk about this and keep repeating that islam is a religion of peace and love many people will continue to believe the koran is a constitution and that rather than being a book written  centuries ago reflecting a particular context it is a legal constitution to apply today 
zineb el rhazoui feels she is carrying on the legacy of her dead charlie hebdo comrades 
after completing high school in morocco el rhazoui studied languages and the sociology of religion obtaining a masters degree from pariss prestigious social science graduate school ehess in her twenties she returned to the country of her birth to work as a journalist at le journal hebdomadaire becoming a campaigner for secular liberties such as the right to break the fast and even snack in public during the month of ramadan this act of nonviolent resistance earned her her first fatwa ahead of her involvement in the movement supporting the arab spring in  the wave of personal attacks and threats that came after her collective protest against ramadan rules prompted her to leave morocco again for france where she began to report for charlie hebdo bringing her memories of having vomited up compulsory religious classes in a country where being muslim is not a choice unless youre jewish or christian 
extreme personality cult 
socalled islamic fascism seen in its most extreme form in groups like isis shares characteristics in common with all extremeright fascisms el rhazoui argues because it combines an intense personality cult around mohammed as the incarnation of the nation it also employs widespread systems of suspicion and denunciation exemplified by sartorial branding  for example burkinis or niqabs  that allow for immediate identification and targeting of nonadherents there are also familiar fascist tropes of repressive sexism against women and homosexuals armed militias adoption of a flag and a strategy that confers the benign status of muslim women to heavily veiled adherents in the west and characterizes them disingenuously as victimized objects of exclusion 
the literary corpus of islam is so stuffed with damning accounts it would be difficult to cleanse it without altering the fundamentals of dogma el rhazoui writes 
if the terrorists of daesh isis behead those they judge to be miscreants that is because they draw on their legislation in the texts like the th surah of the koran alanfal verse  remember what your lord revealed to the angels  i am with you so support those who have believed i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve you can strike them above the neck and strike off every fingertip 
you can be arab muslim and a free thinker 
drawing on her personal experience and scholarly knowledge of islams core arabic texts the politics of the postarab spring middle east and the wellspring of reformism and dissidence embraced within the multifaceted islamic civilization el rhazouis book is an impassioned response to all the extremists who want to see her and her fellow opponents of politicoreligious repression dead 
the greatest racism is el rhazoui argues the racism of the islamist ideology that forbids marriage with people who are not muslims and that rejects women that is the definition of racism and fascism and we must say it the writer adds 
today islam in the world only has a role as a civilization a civilization is defined by many things and not uniquely by religion  but also by its geographical heritage its artistic culinary and sartorial traditions and by literature 
the muslim religion has its place in the modern world if it submits itself fully to the laws that rule humanity today universal principles of equality between men and women sexual and individual freedom and equality for all no matter your creed or religion until islam has admitted this and accepted that the freedom of men and women is superior to it islam will not be acceptable 
islamophobia whiners 
destroy islamic fascism aims to puncture the hypocrisy and fauxintellectual fakery the authors word of islamophobia whiners and other collaborationists from across the political spectrum  particularly the hard left cryptoislamist antiracists on a quest for a new muslim proletariat certain feminists cultural relativists and socalled moderate imams all these willing accomplices do is distort the noble cause of fighting racism to give undeserved legitimacy to an ideology that at its most extreme results in the horrors of islamic state the author says but also makes the lives of millions of muslims living in islamic countries downright miserable 
what do these islamophobia whiners say to the millions of individuals who live in islamic theocracies and dream of liberty el rhazoui concludes in her book who speaks about the nightmare of a woman who decides to cross the streets of algiers casablanca or cairo in a skirt those who would like to drink a glass of alcohol in countries where you have to flout the law to do it  about homosexuals pariahs of muslim societies who often only have the choice of death prison or exile who speaks about this youth born muslim but dreaming of a normal life these teens attacked for having had a romance 


the summer furore over burkini bans in france agitated the author who deplored the cynical rush of islamists and their western sympathizers in the media academia and politics to celebrate the controversial swimsuit as a form of liberation and simultaneously a banal piece of cloth preferred by muslim women even though most never wear it 
western media in an intolerable readiness to oblige have defended the burkini as a freedom and a legitimate cultural expression of a part of humanity she said but pointed out that in muslim countries the beaches are not filling up with burkinis but they are emptying themselves of women from one year to another they are disappearing from the public space because the veil has never been anything except an extension of the walls of their harem to the exterior 
as for mainstream or moderate muslim clerics el rhazoui tells women in the world that during the burkini debate in france not one imam stood up and said hey wait a minute you can be muslim and wear a regular bathing suit 
history will judge those who have monopolized the debate given a platform to islamist fundamentalism and even given it a guarantee of acceptability the author of destroy islamic fascism told women in the world this is just betrayal and it is collaboration with one of the worst forms of fascism that exists today she said 
according to the writer who is repeatedly accused of bigotry the islamophobia ruse is driven by great ignorance and a lack of understanding of the culture of islam and what islam with a big i is  they ignore its complexity and that there have always been opposition currents and progressive and liberal pushes from within 
the accomplices dont recognize the struggles playing out today in arab countries will inevitably be won by the democrats and free people no fascism or totalitarianism has ever been able to win in the long haul of history the people who are the allies and collaborators of this totalitarianism today will be judged by history and seen as accomplices to this criminal ideology to which they have given a veneer of respectability 
for el rhazoui the true racism emerges from a condescending approach to islamic culture that decrees an islamic woman in a burqa is congenitally not free and that her race is the burqa we present the fundamentalists as being a race and this only shows the contempt we have for this culture it is absolutely intolerable she says 
survivor syndrome 
women in the world asked el rhazoui how she manages to keep up her spirits and continue her struggle for the freedom to dissent after everything that has happened since january  
it is a question people often ask me she said with a perceptible tremor in her voice but when you live through these moments in which you are confronted by a reality as cruel and simple as life and death you realize can put many things in perspective 
straight after the attacks like many of my colleagues i felt guilty for having stayed alive i said to myself those who are dead are dead for all our work and some are dead when it wasnt even their work but it was my work because i am a journalist and i am still here and then you understand this is all part of survivor syndrome which is normal when you survive a massacre like that 
as you start to heal you say i am lucky to be alive and if i am still here perhaps that is because i still have something to do i understood long before the attack on charlie when i engaged in a struggle for individual liberties and democracy in morocco that when you fight against totalitarianism whether it is political or religious you should never give your enemies the pleasure of stopping living we fight so that everyone can have a free and happy life and we must continue to live this same life 
zineb el rhazoui c attends the funeral of french cartoonist and charlie hebdo editor stephane charb charbonnier on january   in pontoise outside paris martin bureauafpgetty images 
still a day doesnt go past when she doesnt think of her old colleague charb and their many heated discussions 
he was someone who was extremely lucid and for whom the concepts were clear he was a true humanist who didnt fear being accused of being racist because for him it was absurd 
el rhazouis deconstruction of islam is also a defense of muslims she reasoned as salvation will come when we stop aligning the identity of an entire community with the most fundamentalist people who pretend to represent it 
we have to extend a hand to all these muslims who are free people who have questioned their heritage and who are fighters for liberty battling for the same values as us but in a context controlled by islamists she says 
life in a moving jail 
since january  the survivor from charlie hebdo has traveled frequently to speak at universities and meetings of the freedom forum in europe and the us under the protection assured by the french state and the countries that receive her she says she would never complain about living under permanent armed guard and having her freedom of mobility curtailed because so many other writers and political figures around the world  and especially in islamistcontrolled or influenced countries  are taking the brave decisions to do as she does but without any security 
i always find some spaces of freedom there are always little escape hatches life continues says the woman who has just written her second book since the charlie attacks and recently became a firsttime mother in what she laughingly called the surprise baby boom at a publication that used to have one of the lowest birthrates in french media

Alex Ansary,donald trump kicks off final campaign day with fla rally,"hillary clinton in lead a day before election day  
press tv 
democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton leads her republican rival by three percentage points nationally as they head into the final day of a tight race for the white house according to a new poll 
the final bloomberg politicsselzer  co poll released on monday has clinton ahead of trump  percent to  percent 
libertarian candidate gary johnson was at  percent and green party candidate jill stein had  percent support 
clinton also leads trump by three points in a hypothetical twoway matchup when thirdparty candidates are not included 
another tracking poll released early on monday also put clinton in the lead 
the former secretary of state held a fourpoint lead over the billionaire businessman in the latest abc newswashington post poll the survey showed  percent of likely us voters backed clinton while  percent said they supported trump 
the clinton campaign received a late break with fbi director james comey announcing sunday that no criminal charges were forthcoming in the probe of clintons newlyfound emails 
based on our review we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july the fbi chief wrote in a new letter to congressional committee chairmen 
the development is a major relief to clinton who is spending the final hours of her campaign trying to close trumps path to presidency donald trump walks off the stage after holding a rally at loudoun fairgrounds in leesburg virginia early in the morning on november   photo by afp 
comey sent the presidential race into a frenzy last month when he sent a letter to congress saying the fbi had discovered emails in a separate probe that could be linked to the investigation into clintons use of a private server when she was secretary of state 
the surprise move infuriated democrats and lifted the presidential hopes of trump who has turned the email controversy into a favorite line of attack against clinton 
still trump continued to seize on the email issue insisting that clinton is guilty 
hillary clinton is guilty she knows it the fbi knows it the people know he said sunday at a rally in detroit michigan and now its up to the american people to deliver justice at the ballot box on november  
both clinton and trump plan to spend the last day of the campaign racing across key battleground states that could determine the results of tuesdays election

it is a cruel reality of american electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse and that process has already begun for donald trump 
despite the fact that trump has been claiming that the presidential election is going to be rigged stolen or unfair his cries are beginning to fall on deaf ears the latest washington post tracking poll found that confidence that votes will be counted correctly grew by  points from  the number of respondents who believed that voter fraud occurs somewhat often has dropped from  and those expressing concerns that all votes will be counted accurately dropped from  to  even trump supporters are split  on whether or not votes will be counted accurately 
part of the shift is likely due to the effective job that president obama did in addressing these concerns but it is most likely that voters are treating trump like the candidate who is going to lose the election 
one of the best indicators of a presidential elections outcome as election day draws near is the question of who voters think will win 
hillary clinton is dominant on the question of who voters believe will win the election which is a hint of the way that people are voting 
the process of tuning out the losing candidate has a long history in the us two party system losing candidates who refuse to go away like sarah palin are viewed as annoying relics who refuse to acknowledge that their time is up 
trumps fifteen minutes of fame on the national stage appear to be coming to an end his words can still poison and damage our country at a cultural level which is why he still needs to be discussed but as far as changing minds and winning an election it looks voters are in the process of banishing trump from the political island",naturalnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,3.528806933996037,19,2,2042,357,4.680672268907563,357.0,-1.313479650835859,-1.5173329014319723,-0.2478500899515125,-0.2182928093741662,-0.4030999163943486,-0.211798990503248,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.0772,0.106,0.116,0.778,Negative,Weak

News Syndicator,donald trump rushed off stage in reno after possible assassination attempt,"by now everyone has been reminded that the media is not infallible it is composed of very fallible human beings who make mistakes with the same regularity as all the rest of us i was recently reading a bit about something in statistics called galtons problem an observational dynamic named after its discoverer sir francis galton
to state it very crudely galtons problem is a situation resulting when observers assume that certain things are separate and discrete when in fact they are not for example those who failed to predict donald trumps electoral victory assumed that social conditions in the united states were isolated from those of the rest of the world such people failed to notice the evidence of widespread public anger in many other countries most notably england italy france and hungary
sir francis galton
failure to take into consideration the big picture is still forgivable of course no one can be right all the time or even most of the time systems in the modern world suffer from too much input and data rather than too little but deliberate lying is quite another matter and it is undeniable that some mainstream media outlets have deliberately sought to conceal the truth on a variety of domestic and foreign issues rather than act as a check on governmental power the media has actually become an arm of government power enforcing doctrinal orthodoxy with a variety of carrots and sticks that have proven to be reasonably effective

individual journalists can play significant roles in this process consider a favorite example of mine the case of famed baseball player ty cobb ive been an admirer of cobb for a very long time ever since reading his autobiography as a boy something never quite felt true about all those stories that other biographers would tell about him the worst of these was sports writer al stump whose biography of cobb has now been discredited as mostly fabrication
stump was granted exclusive access to ty cobb in  and  for his biographical purposes cobb shared with him many intimate details of his life and career but instead of faithfully reproducing those recollections stump embellished slanted and outright fabricated numerous anecdotes designed to cast cobb in the worst possible light stump portrayed cobb as a southern racist cobb was from georgia a misogynist and even a murderer cobb was not alive at the time all these stories began to circulate and was unable to defend himself
to add insult to injury stumps writings were used as the basis for a terrible  film called cobb which starred tommy lee jones the film is a tissue of lies and distortions that deserved toand didflop at the box office the real ty cobb was a complex driven and highly intelligent figure who knew how to court controversy when he had to but was actually a gentleman by the standards of the era readers interested in further reading should consult the wonderful biography by charles leerhsen entitled ty cobb a terrible beauty 
a famous photo of cobb stealing third base
to begin with cobb used brains rather than brawn to beat his opponents he made careful studies of all the top players of his day and crafted strategies designed to exploit their weaknesses for example when he learned that pitcher walter johnson hated hitting batters with pitches cobb would crowd the plate to force johnson to walk him he learned how to get inside the heads of his adversaries forcing them to lose their tempers when they did cobb would steal bases right under their noses he remains one of the few players in history who knew how to steal home base

one legend about cobb that has persisted is that he was a violent brawler this is simply not true it is true that men of his era got into fistfights oftenit was part of a healthy masculine culture back thenbut he never gratuitously assaulted or struck anyone the few incidents that have been held out as examples of his misbehavior eg a fight with a black groundskeeper and assorted hotel brawls prove to be on closer inspection nothing more than the standard types of fights that physicallyminded men like him became entangled with nearly all ballplayers of his era engaged in them including babe ruth
al stumps character assassination of cobb went even further painting him as an unreconstructed southern racist who had a grudge against blacks this is completely false cobb was actually one of the few early supporters of integration in the big leagues when asked his opinion about subject by the sporting news in  he said the negro has the right to compete in sports and who is to say he has not
he had nothing but compliments for black athletes like willie mays and jackie robinson and players in the negro league whom cobb interacted with in the s confirm that there was no trace of prejudice in cobbs makeup cobb mentored younger players corresponded with fans with personalized letters and helped found a hospital and a college education fund
cobb was certainly no angel but in hindsight he was nothing more than an aggressive daring man who played professional sports at a time when things were much less regulated than they are now cobb himself may even have allowed spurious tales about himself to circulate in order to court publicity but he had a limit and complete fairy tales he would not tolerate
stumps lies have been so pervasive and persistent that the mythology surrounding cobb will take decades to undo if anything cobb was too trusting in letting a man like stump into his confidence cobb was so angry with stumps hatchet job that he was preparing to sue to prevent publication of stumps writings in  just before his death the terrible  film cobb only added more oil to the fire
malicious journalism can do serious damage sometimes the damage comes from ignorance other times from deliberate peddling of falsehood the motives for lyingwhether coming from money fame or the desire to virtue signalcan always be found if one digs below the surface in the modern era the default rule must be to seek independent confirmation of news stories and to remember that journalists are subject to the same human emotions and weaknesses as all the rest of us

Corey Savage,reasons why youre not happy,"convinced that previous snow plowing policies were sexist the city government of the swedish capital of stockholm recently implemented a feminist system for clearing it it ended in disaster and the city came to an absolute standstill for a start four times as many people than usual were hospitalized for snowrelated injuries nearly as importantly countless workers most of them men were prevented from getting to work it would appear that the patriarchybacked snow won as local politicians ended up apologizing for the havoccausing changes
havoc like this

forgetting that motor vehicles are often more impeded by snow than pedestrians and create a greater safety risk municipal resources which had already been increased were diverted to clearing bicycle paths and sidewalks and away from main roads areas like schools were also prioritized which again ignores the frequently greater ease of walking in snow than driving in it plus the longer distances car commuters face compared to children mothers and other women walking to places the situation is quite plainly moronic for a further reason nonmain roads and other parts of a city take up much more space meaning that the swedish capitals snow removal teams were targeting a far larger less densely used zone to boot this was all during a november already breaking records for snowfall 
the saga in stockholm reads like an microcosm of feminism itself an overeducated meaning undereducated group of leftists come together create data based on feelings and produce a plan of action that screws up an entire community feminists in stockholm had previously complained that the thoroughfares cleaned up first and most extensively by snowplows were the ones heavily used by men how they came to this conclusion is unclear but given the shutdown of the city that resulted from the feminist changes it wasnt based on any solid reasoning with private cars and public transport vehicles alike unable to move in many cases the femalefriendly snowclearing ended up adversely impacting far more people including women than the old one
well done feminists and white knights
what this says about sweden is it really surprising that one of the people responsible for stockholms femalefriendly snow plowing scandal mayor karin wanngård is a feminist and career politician who first joined the council in her teens
because sweden is perhaps the most concentrated welfare state in the world not having people at their jobs and instead stuck in snow is a very bad thing how can a country continue to pay such a large bill for handouts with elected representatives of the caliber of stockholms trying to ruin things sweden is also home to a growing class of lowskilled migrant communities including many tens of thousands from the most recent mediterranean waves last year its recent migrant population is now essentially the same proportionallyspeaking as states more typically associated with multiculturalism such as canada and australia and nonethnic swedes in sweden tend to come from more troublesome cultures compared to the more assimilationfriendly east asians and indians emigrating to canada and australia
how sweden intends to deal with issues like this while balancing urgent economic needs remains to be seen especially with braindead initiatives like the snow plow fiasco taking precedence add to the mix the recent creation of a mansplaining hotline by a swedish labor union and you start to see the real problems scandinavias most basketcase society is trying to solve
so who was organizing the snow plowingand actually doing it yup you guessed it its a man driving
theres no doubt that the feminist snow plowing scheme was an unmitigated disaster and its also extremely likely that the vast majority of people tasked with clearing stockholms streets are men oh the irony not only do feminist politicians try to preference women in the removal of snow they expect men to do the work in achieving it just as sanitation workers and garbage collectors are invariably male dont expect to catch too many female snowplow operators and other snowclearing employees in stockholm
wake up sweden swedish multiculturalism in action
stockholms snow removal catastrophe is emblematic of a country refusing to deal with its real malaise while the men who built sweden are categorized as wouldbe oppressors swedish society itself is close to breaking point even stockholms central train station is now terribly unsafe and various city police forces have long made it known that they do not have control of many suburbs in particular malmö swedens third city and certain districts of stockholm are notorious for ethnic ghettos gang violence rape and other crime
but no mansplaining hotlines and not removing snow in a new feminist way are the clear and present dangers most swedes should fear at night

get ready for the most heartwarming story youll read all day 
if you met paul langdon or ayesha qamar on the street you might think they have nothing in common paul is a retired firefighter ayesha is a law student paul has lived in the same suburb of columbus for his entire life ayesha immigrated to ohio from pakistan when she was a teen paul is a devout christian ayesha is muslim but if you dig a little deeper youll find that they share a common bond both paul and ayesha have trump painted on their garages 
beautiful take a look at the sidebyside pictures above to see just how similar these two really are 
when donald trump announced his campaign last summer paul knew he wanted to show his support by painting a large sign of the candidates name on his garage door but paul probably never would have guessed that one year later just a few towns over from him ayeshas own garage would be painted with literally the exact same word paul and ayesha may be from totally different walks of life but when it comes to the name currently painted on their garages these two have more in common than they ever could have imagined 
at the end of the day it doesnt matter whether their skin is white or brown it doesnt matter whether they worship god or allah and it doesnt matter whether the word trump has been carefully lettered or hastily scrawled across the garage in brusque spray paint all that matters is the commonality they share in having the word trump painted on their homes for the entire neighborhood to see 
amazing it just goes to show you should never judge a book by its cover

a car bomb has reportedly exploded south of the iraqi capital baghdad killing around  people mostly shia pilgrims 
according to security sources a truck loaded with explosives went off on thursday at a gas station in the shomali village in the suburbs of the city of alhilla located  kilometers  miles southeast of the capital baghdad and around  kilometers  miles from karbala 
reports say most of the victims were iranian nationals the photo shows the site of a blast at a gas station near hilla south of the iraqi capital baghdad november

at least seven buses with pilgrims were inside the petrol station at the time an unnamed police lieutenant colonel told afp people carry away the bodies of victims from the site of a bomb attack near hilla iraq november   
afp also quoted an unnamed police intelligence source as saying that those buses were loaded with iranians bahrainis and iraqis ambulances and civil defense are on their way to the site 
the takfiri daesh terrorist group claimed responsibility for the deadly bombing 
in recent weeks daesh has resorted to similar acts of violence in areas outside its control in a desperate attempt to undermine a large iraqi battle aimed at liberating the northern city of mosul the terror groups last remaining foothold in the country 
iran wont waver in backing iraq 
hours after the incident irans foreign ministry spokesman strongly condemned the fatal terrorist blast expressing sympathy with the iraqi government and nation as well as all the families of the victims

the iranian official also stressed that such preplanned and savage assaults emanate from the desperation of the terrorists who are taking successive blows on the battlefield 
these brutal and inhumane acts will not affect the iraqi government and nations determination and the islamic republic of irans support for the oppressed iraqi people in the unrelenting fight against terrorism qassemi said the photo shows the site of a blast at a gas station near hilla south of the iraqi capital baghdad november   
terrorists killing pilgrims will be brought to justice

Dr. Eowyn,hillary clinton is an alcoholic,"posted on october   by tim brown 
among the many wikileaks emails that were dumped this summer it was clear that hillary clinton is not as popular as the media would have you believe in fact it became clear that she has no real support in a hacked email to the point where she was forced to pay young voters to stump online for her 
the gateway pundit reported  
shes the astroturfed candidate hillary is sooo unpopular that she has to pay off young voters to support her and show up at her rallies 
 biggest scoops from the dncleaks wikileak 
wikileaks released nearly  hacked emails it says are from the accounts of democratic national committee officials on friday 
the emails are devastating for hillary clinton according to at least one hacked email hillary clinton has no real support and must pay youth voters to defend her online she also pays millennials to show up at her rallies 
hillarys support is all a lie its all astroturfed everything this woman does is all a lie  even her rallies are fabricated 
if attkissons explanation were not enough how about this tweet regarding the mainstream media putting their collective useful idiot heads together to pitch the same propaganda about donald trump  biggest scoops from the dncleaks httpstcovmtiepspkj 
 mike cernovich  cernovich july   
this should have come as no surprise 
if you remember when her campaign kicked off in  i reported on the fact that more than  of her twitter followers were either completely fake or inactive  
additionally when she had her iowa kickoff event a whopping  people showed up  the majority of those were reporters 
hillary clinton only has the backing of the media and rabid antiamerican liberals and even then it looks like shes having to pay them to actually do anything to support her in other words her candidacy is completely contrived

Henry Wolff,surge of migrants illegally crossing usmexico border ahead of election,"dont root root root for the racist redface team from cleveland paul thornton los angeles times october   
how i wish it were the dodgers who took the field tuesday night in cleveland yes were all sad in los angeles that our team is now one year closer to celebrating the th anniversary of its last world series appearance but this goes beyond provincialism and wounded civil pride 
the dodgers deserved the chance to humiliate a cleveland baseball team that not only persists in identifying itself as the indians but also resurrected the laughably racist redfaced mascot chief wahoo just in time for the playoffs 
for those who havent kept up with the baseball drama heres a summary the cleveland team drew the curtain on its regularseason minstrel show in the spring having replaced chief wahoo on its caps with a vintage red c it never officially retired the offending mascot but wahoo remained confined only to uniform sleeves throughout the regular season leading reasonable people to believe that the team ownership had finally seen the light where other franchises such as the nfls washington redskins remained defiantly in the dark and was easing its fans into the postindians era 
or so we thought chief wahoo reappeared when the cleveland team began its impressive playoff run against the boston red sox and he hasnt left he remained stitched on hats and held aloft by adoring cleveland fans as the team convincingly defeated the toronto blue jays even surviving a legal attack by advocates of canadas indigenous peoples that threatened to forbid even so much as the use of the term indians while the team was on canadian soil 
snip 
its tempting to look past all this and take pity on a city thats had it as rough as cleveland the cubs championship drought has famously lasted for  baseball seasons but the cleveland team boasts a pitiable  years without a world series title beyond sports clevelands decline as an important american metropolis is arguably unmatched having tumbled from a population peak of plus in  to less than  today snip 
but cleveland hey i know some generous wonderfully caring people from that part of ohio which makes wishing for their teams brutal defeat personally difficult but being on the right side of a moral dispute isnt supposed to be easy especially when the team in question isnt the evil washington redskins and its infernal owner daniel snyder clevelands municipal misery doesnt excuse the disgraceful exalting of chief wahoo any more than white mens economic hardship makes donald trumps popularity ok

Infowars.com,top clinton ally caught accepting k foreign donation,"store us government acknowledges that alqaeda is not a priority in syria one might ask then if alqaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror what is darius shahtahmasebi  anti media  october   comments 
last week the us state department acknowledged that alqaedalinked terror group jabhat alnusra is not a priority for the united states efforts in syria 
one might ask then if alqaeda in syria is not a priority for the war on terror what is 
state department spokesman john kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma stating 
the only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in syria is bashar alassad and his supporters  we recognize alnusra as a spoiler we have concerns about comingling ive talked about this ad nauseam 
largely missing from the american narrative of the syrian conflict is that alnusra is shelling residential areas in aleppo where the government holds control of the majority of aleppos citizens in other parts of the world these alqaedalinked extremists are seen as the enemy whereas in syria western media will often refer to them as mere rebel groups 
the united states first officially used the term war on terror on september   to refer to the military campaigns that followed the attacks of september  the stated aim at the time was to defeat islamiclinked terrorist organizations and dismantle regimes the us government accused of supporting terrorism 
in  obama stated  
 we must define our effort not as a boundless global war on terror but rather as a series of persistent targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten america 
the fact that a terror group  one linked to the organization that allegedly launched an act of war against the united states on american soil  is not a priority of the united states state department should tell you something about how farcical and ineffective the war on terror actually is 
this change in rhetoric which is ultimately designed to push ulterior economic agendas in the middle east is an insult to the thousands of soldiers who sacrificed their lives under the false pretense that they were going to protect their families from alqaedalinked terrorists newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,7.057613867992074,52,8,2342,386,5.007772020725389,386.0,-0.3045033525141309,-0.3899286096724409,-0.1684785890960189,-0.172830066462316,-0.0802845402360471,-0.1652733464959138,0.005181347150259,0.0,0.0025906735751295,0,1,0.0,0.0110044797518478,-0.9954,0.05,0.186,0.764,Negative,Very Strong
Jean-Batave Poqueliche,the most important concepts the manosphere taught me,"firearms panics happen over a variety of things like acts of domestic terrorism mass shootings or democrats getting elected to office though we may not have to worry about this for a few years after nd amendment enthusiast donald trumps decisive victory last night lets cover our bases and talk about a panic if future democrats are elected
what is a panic for ammo and firearms a panic is when people go and buy items just to have them because they are worried that there will soon be no more or it will be illegal to buy and sell such items but maybe not to own them already as most americans still believe in the no ex post facto laws part of the constitution
adding to a panic is speculators who buy from retailers who are roundly shamed if they raise their own prices only to resell privately at much higher levels while this is legal it certainly isnt ethical or a decent thing to do and these folks deserve being shamed and mocked at every opportunity
lastly the gun stores or sites inventory cannot handle the flex in the buying demand nor can the manufacturer and an artificially contrived panic creates a real scarcity that can only be corrected by the panic running out of steam as everyone buys what they consider to be enough and natural undercutting resets the price back to lower levels
some prices never return  long rifle ammunition has still not totally recovered from the damage old brock the islamic shock obama did to it with his multiyear championship of best firearms salesman ever and it may be even worse under the bitch in chief
so what gets grabbed in a panic what should you get what should you count on still being available weve got three categories guns ammo and componentsaccessories
guns anything thats big on the liberal hit list is a first target for a ban so its a first target for a panic look for things that are popular with the right and scary to the left also look for things that are modern no one is going to ban the m garand anytime soon
evil features matter more than destructive power anyone who knows anything about guns knows that the ak and the ar fire intermediate cartridges that are puny enough to be considered inhumane in several states with which to hunt deer as they lack the power to kill the animal with marginal shots however theyre black and have mean things attached to them so theyre on the shit list while a nice blued with wooden stock scoped bolt action rifle in a magnum cartridge capable of wrecking your world from twice the distance that an ar can pull is safe as it looks traditional

they have to be popular to the left to get noticed rifles like the fal and anything based of the ghk action simply dont have enough exposure to get targeted unless they pull something sweeping like the usc  r rules again the mini  and the ma might be safe maybe
for pistols pretty much any semiautomatic of the polymer age is fair game to want banned oftentimes stupid rules like restrictive magazine sizes get pushed s hi powers other old domestic semiautos and revolvers should be safe expect the libtards to go after glocks and the like
shotguns seem to be immune these days as theres not a whole lot of difference between a hunting gun and a combat gun other than paint and mag tube length i think the saigas are still not being imported and its about the only box mag fed one out there but anything else makes a good home defense gun that should also be immune to the ammo panic portion as well
ammunition range full metal jacket and defensehunting hollow or soft point cartridges in popular centerfire calibers and  long rifle will almost literally evaporate from your local store and online and its probably beginning as i write this
oddly enough only certain rounds will suffer panic buying for rifles its limited to   and  traditional hunting rounds like   and  do not seem to be impacted why doesnt  get bought in a panic as the old joke goes men with s dont panic but it really has to do with the feedback cycle i mentioned at the start if theres little demand it cannot exceed the instore supply so the perception of it being gone for good cannot occur
everything but the shotgun shell and the howitzer round to the far right will sell fast in a panic
panic bought pistol ammo is the big  mm luger  sw and  acp  will round out the affected semiautomatic rounds and there usually is a bit of a run on  magnum and  special as well mm  sig  gap and other magnums like the  do not seem to be affected
for rimfires  long rifle just goes poof while its magnum brother and smaller  caliber cousins do not seem to be as affected rimfires are not reloadable and this contributes to their overstockpiling
components and accessories most centerfire ammo is reloadable and the serious amongst shooters will roll their own for economy selfreliance and performance so the consumable components will also get some panics although ive held off on reloading articles until i get my press set back up we can hit up the components that will get panic bought briefly

biggest thing is primers even bigger than the bullets oddly enough the primer is the little metal cup that gets smacked by the firing pin and sets off the powder in modern cartridges and they come in two sizes for pistols two for rifles and of varying hardness to satisfy military specifications
the second is gunpowder itself fortunately theres a wide variety of smokeless powder and everyone tends to have the brands and formulas they prefer so it takes a little less of a hit than the primers the third is the bullets and since there are so many types and manufacturers they also take a little less of a hit than primers while you obviously need all three to reload bear that in mind always save your brass and anyone elses you can pick up
even though the little ones are easier to use the higher capacity ones disappear first get both
while it is always a good idea to have spare springs and small parts like firing pins and extractors that are prone to breakage the number one accessory or part to take a hit in panics is the box magazine especially high capacity ones i dont mean the  round drum mags although those do take a dive nor do i really mean the  round coffin mags but i mean the full capacity full sized pistol mags like a  round mag for a full sized pistol or a  round ar mag expect to see pmags and surplus style aluminum ar mags just vanish the gabby giffords special the extended glock   round mag is also a contender for vanishing fast in a panic
holsters slings cleaning accessories optics and ammo cans seem to be immune from panics
what to do if you already own a carbine andor a semiauto pistol make sure you have enough ammo magazines and spare parts its a lot better to have one gun with multiple mags and a lot of ammo than many guns with the one or two mags with which they came from the factory and a couple boxes of ammo
i try to have at least six mags for my semiauto pistols and at least ten mags for my semiauto rifles get some rifle mags of different sizes the  and  ar mags are fun for shooting standing up but they get in the way of prone firing and the  and  rounders are preferable
your ultimate ammo goal i maintain should be a thousand practice rounds and  defense rounds for each gun you have but in a prepanic or panic situation just get what you can at a normal price some is better than none if youre into reloading you know what to get already
if you dont own anything and want to soon refer to some pistol articles  a rifle article a shotgun article and a buying guide here consider buying some stripped ar lowers to build on a rainy day later on
build an ar and meet girls at the range
conclusion no matter who got elected i think this country is in for rough times its always better to have firearms and not need them then not have them and need them store yours safely but accessible and ready in times of need

in an election season full of anger and divisiveness its easy to lose sight of just how important and meaningful our democratic process is thankfully as millions have cast their ballots today theres been no shortage of heartwarming stories involving americans exercising their right to vote one of those stories centers around lifelong mississippi resident helen karnes who although not quite old enough to have been born before women won the right to vote is still pretty goddam old 
wow what a special woman 
while karnes cant claim that she was alive during a time when women were still politically disenfranchised it just takes one look at her to tell that shes fucking old no she might not have the inspiring thematically satisfying story of a yearold but you get the sense that shes definitely lived through some shit she was certainly around in wwii times and she mightve even been there for the depression too who knows this is no spring chicken were talking about here 
though admittedly karnes story would be a bit cooler if shed been alive before  you still have to applaud her for being old on this historic election day also her mom and her aunts were definitely alive before womens suffrage so you know shes probably got some good secondhand stories that she heard from them maybe one of them was even an important figure in the womens rights movement or something statistically speaking thats probably not the case but you never know 
its unclear if karnes voted today for americas first female presidential nominee or if she even voted at all but what matters is that shes brittle stoopedover and ancient there are probably lots of dusty ol bats out there who are older than karnes and who have more of a substantial foothold in us womens history but this lady is still more or less a living skeleton and thats something that should make us all proud to be americans",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,35,7,1889,329,4.72644376899696,329.0,-0.8242790213465364,-0.5778293249656962,-0.2883295553878142,-0.2621878714959526,-0.3579279346469655,-0.2567203019586053,0.0060790273556231,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0091797960522404,0.9817,0.156,0.068,0.775,Positive,Very Strong
Mike Rivero,the death of john kennedy,"print 
before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out allow me to explain my decision to vote for donald trump on nov  
first im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you 
second im not endorsing donald trump in my mind theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate 
third i respect those in the nevertrump camp and share many of their concerns including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies just to name a few among the nevertrump voices i respect are columnists like david french and ben shapiro bloggers like matt walsh and evangelical leaders like russell moore and beth moore 
fourth i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over trump as if he were some kind of savior figure supporting him as if he were st donald i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of trumps failings constantly saying let him who is without sin cast the first one see john  this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation 
fifth my decision to vote for trump barring something earthshattering between now and nov  is consistent with my position which has been  during the gop primaries i issued strong warnings against voting for trump while we had other excellent choices i did this in writing  on video and on the radio but always stating that if trump won the nomination i would reevaluate my position  once trump became the republican candidate i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote  i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for hillary for two strong warnings about hillary see here and here  
so what has convinced me that i should now vote for donald trump 
the culture war is not over gain hope courage and practical advice in michael browns latest book outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide 
first i believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife proconstitution supreme court justices when he said during the last debate that if youre prolife you want to see roe v wade overturned and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of  potential appointees he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected 
second one reason i endorsed sen ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment both democratic and republican to the point of calling it the washington cartel trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although unfortunately hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system so my vote for him is also a protest vote 
third i am voting for the republican platform not the republican party which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole 
fourth while i have always felt that the line were electing a president not a pastor was overstated and superficial if we rephrased it to say were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors not a pastor it might have more relevance in other words we are not looking for trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges and at this point he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one rather out of our choices for president which are stark we are voting for the one most likely to defeat hillary and make some good decisions for the nation not be the savior and with things so messed up in america the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home 
fifth within the first few minutes of the last debate the massive differences between hillary and trump were there for the world to see she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties since i have the opportunity to vote i feel that i should vote for trump 
sixth trump continues to be drawn to conservative christians and not just ones who tickle his ears one of my dear friends has spent hours with trump and members of his family and he has told me that in  years of ministry no one has received him as openly and graciously as has trump yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms while i am not one of those claiming that trump is a bornagain christian i see absolutely no evidence of this the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president 
seventh although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses and for me the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house in that context i echo the words and warning of dr martin luther king jr the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority 
so in sum  my hope is in god not donald trump and i do recognize that either hillary or trump has the potential to do great harm to america  my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation  i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for hillary clinton whose policies will certainly do us great harm and  ultimately the most effective way to defeat hillary is to vote for trump while also praying that god will use him for good  not for evil 
in the end if trump gets elected and fails miserably i will be grieved but not devastated if he does well i will rejoice 
either way though my vote is just that a vote my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution receive michael browns commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for michael browns alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",whydontyoutrythis.com,Real,english,84.76092567749471,23.401690216082972,25,5,6836,1239,4.491525423728813,1239.0,-1.130029414777363,-0.9536307555522068,1.0205064937192745,1.1644016474621046,-0.5897693028313663,1.203222320340504,0.0016142050040355,0.0,0.0008071025020177,0,0,0.0,0.002647973384187,0.9988,0.156,0.078,0.766,Positive,Very Strong

the page document written in  by doug band of teneo a private consulting firm that raised millions for the foundation and also scouted out paid gigs for what was dubbed bill clinton inc the washington examiner reports 
in one instance band secured a  donation to the clinton foundation from banking giant ubs he later arranged for bill clinton to give three paid speeches to the firm for a total of  the hill reported 
but in his memo band argues his double duties were independent of one another the memo was written after chelsea clinton criticized bands role within the familys network of interests the hill reports

we appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles and the goal of seeking ways to ensure we are implementing best practices to protect the tax exempt status of the foundation band wrote in his memo to justify his role and bat back criticism the hill reports 
band cofounded teneo with former state department employee declan kelly while hillary clinton was secretary of state  and paid bill clinton as an adviser through  the hill reports 
bands memo lists several teneo clients that he and kelly leveraged into major donors for the foundation and also details the personal introductions the two principals made between the clintons and the prospective donors the hill reports 
one that kelly cultivated was cocacola ceo muhtar kent which led to sevenfigure donations beginning in

if theres anything the  election showed us its that the american people are increasingly distrustful of and not listening to the commands laid out by the once mainstream media theyre increasingly reticent to commit national and demographic suicide under the guise of diversity and other nebulous ideals theyre desperate not only to drain the swamp but to restore some sense of national pride and stability to the declining usa 
in response the controllers of the presstitutes the people who really run the world are already hard at work trying to find some way to create a false narrative about fake news sites in order to lay the ground work for censorship and control the internet has all but destroyed the corporategovernment narrative and there is a shit fit happening at the highest levels of the propaganda ministry ie cnn abc cbs nbc et al because they have learned the american people know how full of shit they really are 
sites like return of kings are on the front lines of this war in support of free speech and it is vitally important we stay on top of our game to avoid a reversion to the managed propaganda the centralized control of mass media gave us over the last  years hackers and leakers play right into the hands of the censorship narrative 
make no mistake one of the reasons leakers of misdeeds done by politicians and the elite they work for have been allowed to continue leaking dirty laundry is because it plays into the hands of those with designs on censorship and regaining control of the information the sheeple get to listen to having julian assange and edward snowden doing leaks of information and giving them extensive press coverage plays right into the hands of the censorship brigade because they can also play the protecting national security game when the time to silence dissent comes  
fake news is only the first assault in what is sure to become a full scale war on free speech on the internet we can be thankful trump won the election rather than the bitch since his election will slow the process of censorship but the aggressiveness of the fake news narrative shows us how determined some people are to shut us up and shut us down 
the new york times is already on the front lines of this assault on free speech on the internet only days after the bitch lost the election publisher arthur sulzberger published a mea culpa and promised to rededicate the newspaper to honest reporting 
we cannot deliver the independent original journalism for which we are known without the loyalty of our subscribers the new york times promises to give the news impartially without fear or favor we also approach the incoming trump administration without bias 
dont buy into it this is whats known in public relations as a diversion tactic while we focus on our seeming victory theyre already moving on to their next false narrative  socalled fake news no sooner than the ink dried on the promise to give trump a chance the new york times was moving to shut up the very people who made possible his rise to power  the altright and alternative news web sites 
while some fake news is produced purposefully by teenagers in the balkans or entrepreneurs in the united states seeking to make money from advertising false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere 
they did a spurious case study on how a rumor got started about protesters being bussed in to protest at trump rallies never mind the mainstream media is a business that runs lock stock and barrel on fake news almost every narrative they create is a false one one need do no more than a google search to discredit many if not most of the mainstream medias stories the hypocrisy is astounding pulling the plug facebook censorship algorithms are nothing compared to the elites agenda of eliminating free speech online 
whether or not the fake news narrative gains traction the next step will be for the elite to create a problem that affects millions of people online then follow through with the hegelian dialectic with a preordained solution to make everyone safer online and to stop the spread of false information while protecting free speech online by destroying it 
look for no less than a figurative internet  if the elite become desperate enough 
theyll pull the plug on the backbone of the internet shutting down ecommerce and communication online for a few days blame it on a fake news story just like benghazi was blamed on a youtube video then spring in to save us from ourselves by passing all sorts of creative laws and restrictions aimed at nothing more than eliminating competition to the corporategovernment narrative and gutting yet another of our bill of rights protections 
make no mistake freedom of speech is the most important of amendments to the constitution once that is taken away its game over obama has already floated the idea of silencing those of us who cling to our guns and religion and continues this narrative even after the election of trump 
obama has already been floating the idea of official news web sites this is nothing more than proposing the creation of the american equivalent of pravda in the soviet union in which only the stateapproved newspaper was considered the truth and everything else was considered lies obviously the new world order socialist narrative would be the only truth under a system such as this and traditional and conservative views would be relentlessly silenced 
check out what the messiah said in berlin recently 
in an age where theres so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a facebook page or you turn on your television where some overzealousness on the part of a us official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made then we wont know what to protect if we cant discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda then we have problems 
the fact he is saying these things should frighten you it should also make you angry this statement is a pc way of saying the goal of the power structure is to shut us the fuck up they want us to listen to clueless journalists who encourage the idea of microchipping your children and later yourselves so every aspect of your life can be controlled by the government 
we must fight back by discrediting the fake news narrative at every turn and informing those who will listen of the possibility of a fake internet  designed to give the government a reason to curb free expression on the very libertarian internet of today",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,85.16960871803,66,10,7578,1305,4.782375478927203,1305.0,0.1235471982890264,-0.0141271790859303,1.216818672501862,1.2678685796063152,-0.3027288222050697,1.309108268770989,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.9925,0.123,0.147,0.73,Negative,Very Strong

Roosh Valizadeh,nationalism is a trap,"i am a rock n roll nigger httpsyoutubegsovftvlrk daniel w mccullar 
as a mix blood american any time i hear someone in the black community use the n word in any way or form i hear and see ignorance when i hear someone outside the black community use it i see nothing less than a disease spreading it is a term that should be nothing less than unacceptable no other racial group uses derogatory terminology to describe themselves using the excuse that you are taking control of it is a bullshit juvenile excuse jay 
thanks for the comment my nigga guy 
although i am not hispanic i understand the slang pretty well and have employed many over the years  
you would be surprised at the what comes out of there mouths about blacks and whites including thouse who come from other countries in south america as well there feelings and attitudes of anyone they consider different in appearance  
we as the white race dont have anywhere near the market cornered as to racial predigest and racism in general just ask the jews or palestinians about that  
we just understand it more from our own little perspective of the world around us but it is prevalent all over no matter where you happen to be at or from  mr 
she said the in n word on facebook bet she dont have the guts to say it in person further more for every white racist that call blacks n word that dont offend us you wanna know y u dont have to be black to be call a n word we as black people use it to insult our ancestors then we think its cool for whites to say it truth be told white people are niggas also u wanna know why well look the word up and u will see we are not niggas we are negros nigga or niggas is jus another word for stupid dumb and ignorance so look at u now who the nigga now um damn shame for a fucked up world guy 
so what do you consider a white honkey or cracker to be  considering i was one who watched the original archie bunker and gladys shows and thought they were great i never liked gov wallace and thought what the cops did in selma alabama and little rock was just wrong  i have always believed mr king was right while thinking that sharpton and jackson are in it just for the money and political opportunities and believe the the blm has done some good but has been hijacked by out side influence that sees political gain to be won on the behalf of hillary who i think will absolutely destroy the intercitys by keeping herself and her kind in power over the backs of african americans and others she deems deporables  mr 
im not racist im jus stating facts why whites get mad when they came out with black lives matters  then they say they are thugs an terrorist how so when whites rally up and sit at the store and everywhere else with a bunch of bikers but they tell the blacks oh they in a bike club shitting me half of them kkk if not all police is the biggest gang of america they get mad cause we sale drugs truth be told the police the one putting drugs on the streets we dont own boats plans for that matter to go get drugs at the end of the day the world is jus fucked up period mr 
further more fuck jessie jackson im from greenville to he aint did shit for that community beside rebuild his old apt complex and added his name on where was he when the police killed my friend in fountain inn sc an took him back to the jail after the fact he was dam near dead then tried to say he hung himself where the justice for that guy 
mr just about every black man woman and child in n s carolina knows that justice lives in the bottom of every toilet in every jail in just about every southern state in the south that the white cracker shits in and calls it truth  
now we as the whites have learned to refine the obvous racism that still exist to the point of having a black president to make it look legit for the world to see  
what do you suppose president putin sees when he shakes hands with obama just a man or a black man  
personally i belive that racism is part of the our genetic make up considering man has been making slaves for many thousands of years out of all races including white and black  
i just dont act upon my inherited prejudice nor choose to pass it on to my children 
i think that is what makes the difference realizing its there but choosing not to act on the difference is what separates me from the others who just make lip service to there ingrained predigest while knowing full well they dont believe a word that comes out of there mouths  
when i see you i see a black man who is just as frail or strong as i am wanting the same as i do in life and just asking for the chance to work for it  
if on the other hand if you are a white or black thug or punk gang banger it dosent matter you will be treated as such  mr 
you right i never said u was wrong one time we both are human we both have and opinion at the end u see things your way i see things my way i know u not racist u know im not racist but at the end of the day can u say u can live in a black community with u jus being the only white people in the neighborhood check this my home paid for own my land also tell me y a police sit by my yard asking me  bout the white guy in my yard and then start to as random do u think its right with out the proper cause guy 
no i dont think i want to live were you do considering i am too damn old and set in my ways to want to besides i dont think my wife is going to want to move quite yet  my oldest son moved to alaska a few years ago with his wife and dogs and they enjoy it a lot both got good jobs and doing well even bought a house on a acre of land for about half of what you would pay for one around one here in the san francisco bay area 
brentwood was once know as a red necked farming town of about  people when i was a kid growing up here my family have been farming for generations the hispanics were our hired labors living in labor camps and the blacks were shown the city limit lines by the police  
my mom was considered progressive and we had a black nanny named pearly live with us for many years durring the summers while mom ran the ranch i loved her much she was a good woman as wide as she was tall would read to me and my sister and made incredible apple pies i first meet her when i was  living in richmond ca to when we moved here in the mid s into the house my mom built that i still live in today pearlys children came to my sisters wedding 
now brentwood is a city of  i dont recognise it any longer but its core is still farming there are black families living on my street in houses built where there were once orchards and going to the schools i did i have a family i would consider white trailer trash living in the house next door that once had garden tour buses come to see the yard and have tea parties  
my attitude is people are people i really dont give a damn who you are be respectful of me and keep up your home and property to show your pride in ownership and you should expect the same from me  we can be friends and neighbors sharing a beer at a barbecue i throw on july th and at christmas and go fishing once in a while in my bass boat  
as to the other thing you mentioned i think about cops being randomly nosey asking about me because i was the white guy sitting in your yard in a all black neighborhood  what fucking business is it of his  if he asked me i would politely tell him to go f off and then shut the hell up f he pushed it there would be complaints filed against him the next day and perhaps speeking to his chief and maybe the city counsel as well depending on the situation  its not a good idea to piss me off cause i not only get mad i get even too  mr 
get mad about what thats childish to get mad cause we voice our opinion my dad married to a white women my uncle married to a white women im white a women an u know what we bout to get married my neighbor are not bad i dont stay in a violent neighborhood everyone stay on my road is family members at the end of the day i ask do u think the police was right for asking me  in my yard im  i know right from wrong also guy 
i am a little confused which is not hard to do 
i think you are asking me if it was okay that the cops who had stopped outside of your yard ask you over and question you about some white guy who was in your yard visiting with you  correct  
if that is right  then my answer is no  hell no  unless the guy is a known gangster with a rap sheet a mile long  and even then there are ways and means for the cops to go about there business to conduct there investigations with out asking people about theres thats why the detectives make the big bucks to covertly investigate with out shooting off the alarm bells  
for some local flat foot to come up to you on your own property and start pumping you for information with out any justifiable cause is against your constatutional rights illegal immoral and he can go take a flying leap off a short bridge  
i know its done all the time and cops seem to have every excuse in the book to want to try it 
but my point is simply to smile at him tell him to have a nice day and walk away you dont ow him a thing if he still wants to push it then tell him you dont have to talk to him unless your lawyer is present  that will usually set them running  
i see too many stories about people getting into all sorts of trouble because they start flapping there gums thinking they are cool and just digging an even deeper hole for themselves to fall in 
cops know from training how to push our buttons and rely on our own stupidity to sink our boat as the results  mr 
yes he did i was asking u do u think he was in the right guy 
damn dude  i was afraid you were going to tell me that this actually happened to you  
it totally freaks me that it could and would but dosent really surprise me anymore that it does considering that many citys had stop  frisk on the books untill only recently  but supposedly it has been done away with according to the courts recent rulings fat chance of that really happening cops will just come up with a new way of doing there thing of harassing people for there fishing for a crime scene 
i am sorry that it has and wish i could do something to stop it  knowing that because of the color of my skin is probably the only reason why it doesnt or hasnt to me  except when i was a kid living in berkeley ca then i got hassled by the cops quite a bit because of the hair down to my butt they all thought i was a drugged out hippy which a lot of the time was true i got slammed around by them quite a bit shot at and gassed a few times then arrested and served time in jail and probation for things that now are not considered a crime anymore  for some of the crap i use to do and the people i ran with i am lucky to be still breathing 
unfortunately that is the times we all live in and certainly it is unfair to you to be victimised because of it i hope you filed a complant against this ass hole to seek retrabutin  mr 
i understand that ive did things in my life im not happy bout cant sleep at nite the nightmare i have i jus take it one day at a time and think god im still breathing truth be told i almost lost my life  times before i was  and the only thing slowed me down from the streets is my first son hes  now my middle son  and my baby boy is  and i have a lil girl that jus turned  so i thank god a lot cause i have something to live for havent been to a club in yrs it feels good to be out the streets and doing some good for a change only thing i have did to make my life complete is going back to church but ill go when im ready but i do read the bible so there for i dont forget where i come from i respect u and dont know u its actually good we had this chat everything u told me i took that inconsideration truly i thank u i dont know everything but i dont mind listen mr 
i stop dealing drugs a few yrs ago actually until i find a job that pays  a hr when my ma first found out she had cancer i use to make sure i would not go home unless i had  a week in my pocket to help my ma with her medical bills and medicine she fought that cancer for yrs right before she died  yrs ago i promise her i wouldnt sale anymore and that was a promise i keep  at the end of the month i had to put in a lot of blood and tears for what i did and my ma was not proud of the blood money i was bringing into the home but when she seen what i was actually doing with my money i think she respect me to a certain degree and i accepted that sometimes she would accept nothing from me ive been locked up  times and started dealing weedcokegunspills at the age of  honestly my ma use to beat me when she found out but i never stopped i caught my first charge at  by the time i was  i had did everything i could possibly do i think i had a good run in life i never had my father after the fact he was a big time drug dealer and him and ma got a divorce and he got on his on product and lost everything he been sober for  yrs he doing good but i never hated him for what he did in life actually it made me stronger i had a step dad but only he was good for is taking me fishing far talking to bout men things he did cause he didnt know how to cause he had  girls but at the end of the day he raised me from the time i was  until he passed he was good man in his own ways and till this day i thank god for each parent i had in my life with no regrets i jus wish the world become a better place guy 
hey  at least you are still alive and hopefully clean and sober with a family that loves you  that is a lot more than some of the people you knew when you were running the streets ill bet consider yourself mr to be blessed  
never a father figure in my life just a strong willed old fashioned no nonsense mom who drove her father into oakland from brentwood everyday at the age of  in  she introduced me to the ymca in oakland when i was  took a lot of backpacking trips with them to the bottom of the grand canyon to visit the havasupai indians that lived there hiked all over california montana yellowstone yosemite and europe backpacking and hiking should be a mandatory class in hs especially to intercity kids who never get out and see the real world except concrete pavement and maybe a city park  
i understand why you did what you did you will receive no condemnation from me for it  some of the people i ran with were totally vicious animals to the point of wondering if they were at all human or not  hells angels and there buds were some i knew and partied with in the late s while living on telegraph ave in berkeley even ran into some original black panthers along the way now thouse guys were freaky and strange always talking about revolution and wanting to blow white people up  
what saved me was getting the hell out of there moving to a small town in the mountains finishing my college education there later meeting a good woman who put up with my bs and marrying her we have been together  years produced two fine sons that are a joy to us i became a small business man as owner operator of a landscape contracting company for  years first working for retail and wholesale nurseries and other landscape companies to gain experience never went into farming with the family my brother was the one who did that with my mom my sister has her life with her husband  years but to say i was born with dirt under my fingernails and will probably die that way is close to the truth sometimes i rather talk to plants than people because its easer that way and they dont give me grief like people do 
hey  if you want to shoot me an email sometime i am not against it i can be reached at email protected after all this is a open and public forum and maybe you are not all that comfortable as the result suit yourself mr 
im still alive cause god showed me awaywhere i didnt have to hold people for ransom or in a drug trade shoot out all the time he made me realize i was only making memories in the streetsbut ill never think ill live to tell a lot of people who didnt know me my life style jus feel like before some of the whites judge us blacks they should actually look at the community we lived in if we lived in a drug neighborhood it wasnt by choice thats for damn sure we adapted to the fine cars clothes and everything that came with it only thing about it a small price came with also guy 
good to hear now what are you doing  mr 
doing father dutys guy 
so what s that for you  what line of work are you in how many rug rats you got running around your wife work or is she a stay at home mom  whats the town or city like you live in  got any hobbies or are you sports nuts 
just curious is all sure its none of my busies and mean no offence or none taken if you dont want to talk guy 
i hope your education dose not reflect the way you write but if it dose god help us all because you are the next generation and inheritors of what has been left to you so you can build onto it for the betterment of the future generations  your children and there childrens children  to come  mr 
as long as i graduated from high school im happy long as my job allow me to bring him  to  every two weeks im happy my education aint got nothing to with how i shorten my word like everyone else in life i be willing to bet i go to a interview and talk jus like the white people and come out with a job didnt know education had to do with the problems thats going on in the world all my kids straight a students what about your kids are they me speaking my thoughts and opinions dont have nothing do with how i write im not in school anymore i feel i shouldnt have to prove shit to no one but my self and my kids guy 
of course you are a proud father and well you should be dont we all as parents want and expect our children to be better than we were  i think that is only natural 
my sons both graduated from collage and are set in there lives both in there early s one married and living in alaska working as a city planner and the other is still here at home finishing up his education cheaper that way 
there mother and i dint get past a two year community collage degree with me going into business as a landscape contractor  years 
you are right your education has nothing to do with any of the crap that occurring you dont have anything to prove to me and your thoughts and opinions are just that yours alone and who the hell am i to criticise  
mr you talk the way you want and feel comfortable in and i will just listen and offer commentary once in awhile if its okay with you mr 
i like listening to older people it makes me more wiser an not dumb like some american u only have wisdom from being wise hugh culliton 
call me premillennial but i find it baffling that anyone regardless of where they think itll go would lack the judgement to realize that creating a permanent record of such potentially personally damaging actions is a terribly stupid thing to do 
in addition to unprofessional conduct she should also have been fired for such criminal idiocy guy 
i dont agree at all  or perhaps it comes from your firm belief that you have never done something dumb rash or saying something that would be considered even remotely offencive by someone else  hmmm  hugh culliton 
on the contrary  its precisely because i know that ive done and said dumb things and that the recording of such things makes them vulnerable to being hacked that i find it baffling that one would want such personal  and completely normal  incidents of lack of judgement permanently recorded online 
we live in the world of total online or even onnetworkedcomputer collection of data as a high school teacher i deal with this every time i teach teens internet safety thats why i see it as being a generational trend by people whove grown up with their entire lives on line such an environment means that while on the upside we can out trolls racist leos and nasty pedophiles it also means that everyone need to be very very careful with all data and information they store online 
however in this case we have someone  not acting as a private citizen  but as a uniformed representative of the state  in a time of very tense relations between law enforcement and the public taking personal images of a highly offensive nature mistake or not  its out there and this action still betrays a serious lack of the judgement expected from a law enforcement officer guy 
she and everyone else who speaks in public  
trump has been made keenly aware of that fact as the results of what he said  yrs ago is now coming back to bite him as well clinton

when most people think about their eye health  the first thing that comes to mind is whether or not they need to wear glasses although your vision is a major part of your overall eye health there are actually many more things that you need to be concerned about for example there are a staggering  common disorders that can plague your eyes these issues range from cataracts to ocular migraines fortunately there are many natural methods you can utilize to help keep your eyes healthy 
nutrients your eyes need 
there are three nutrients that are known to be critical for maintaining healthy eyes lutein zeaxanthin and mesozeaxanthin each of these nutrients serves as an antioxidant that helps protect your eyes from the damaging effects of free radicals as natural news has pointed out before free radicals are the main basis of all injuries illnesses and deaths 
antioxidants are the only way to fight free radicals so its a good thing that these three nutrients are found naturally in the human eye but what happens when something interrupts this process sadly you can end up with a long list of eye health problems that may even lead to blindness 
instead of merely sitting back and allowing this to happen you can be proactive and start taking supplements the good news is that lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are easy to find research has discovered that most of these supplements also contain mesozeaxanthin although this isnt usually disclosed on the label in fact it sounds likely that this recently discovered eye nutrient is a natural byproduct of lutein and zeaxanthin 
of course this doesnt absolve the supplement companies of their duty to report whether or not mesozeaxanthin is present in their products however their negligence also doesnt reduce the natural reliance that your eyes have on all three of these nutrients in addition to stocking up on these supplements it is also wise to increase your intake of other naturally occurring antioxidants including vitamin e vitamin c and beta carotene 
food sources 
there are many foods that contain antioxidants  carrots are perhaps the most wellknown resource for eye health because they are so rich in beta carotene it would be a mistake to think of carrots as the prime resource though you can also turn to oranges tomatoes sweet potatoes and dark berries for a mixture of necessary vitamins these are some of the best foods for eye health even better you can derive lutein and zeaxanthin directly from food sources such as eggs pistachios corn peppers and kale with enough of these food items in your diet you can avoid the cost of supplements while still keeping your eyes extremely healthy 
additional eye health tips 
if you are a smoker who is also concerned about eye health now is a good time to carefully consider quitting unfortunately people who smoke have an increased risk of developing macular degeneration optic nerve damage and cataracts if you begin abstaining from tobacco products now though your odds of ending up with one of these eye health complications will begin to decline 
other easy steps you can take to protect your eyes include always wearing sunglasses during sunny days and steering clear of computer screens as much as possible if you use a computer for work take a  second vision break every  minutes 
ultimately combining the proper nutrients with easy tips such as wearing sunglasses will help keep your eyes healthy throughout your life if youre currently dealing with issues such as light sensitivity and vision loss you may also be able to naturally regain control of your eye health by using natural vision training and other eye exercises this is definitely a better option than undergoing a surgery that has an extensive list of serious risks and usually leaves patients still needing eyeglasses as usual the natural way is better

Jason Easley,trump throws a fit when asked why he is promoting his hotel instead of campaigning,"by sarah jones on sat oct th  at  pm donald trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn a newly surfaced video via ryan grim shows the trump humiliation game in action which i walk everyone through from the pov of the woman share on twitter print this post 
if youre a woman whos worked in any business where youre forced to try to appease the massively sensitive ego of a sexually aggressive vulgar man in power you will know exactly whats about to happen in this video 
donald trump uses sexual shaming and humiliation of women as simplistic revenge for the slightest felt spurn and theres a newly surfaced video via ryan grim at huffington post that shows the trump humiliation game in action 
in the video trump publicly sexualizes and shames the  miss universe winner from australia jennifer hawkins as revenge before he does it trump tells the audience get even with people if they screw you screw them back  times as hard i really believe that 
watch this newly surfaced  corporate speech here via huffington post major trigger warning if youve been there 
watching this you see the trump modus operandi in action this is the sting felt by numerous women who report spurning trumps advances the harassment as revenge the sexual shaming 
trump sets the audience up for the roman gladiator moment of public sexual offering by priming them with his belief that you should screw people back if they screw you the sexually angry verb foreshadows whats to come because he is going to screw jennifer hawkins in public when she realizes that because its public she cant further humiliate him by saying no or objecting without facing huge repercussions 
trump says hes going to give them an example of his revenge theory jennifer hawkins 
trump orders hawkins to the stage the audience cheers and jeers delighting in the upcoming shaming of the beautiful girl its to be a public spanking so much fun 
first of all how beautiful is jennifer trump asks claiming ownership of jennifer as an object while playing magnanimous daddy who dishes out praise and approval before the spanking the message he can make or break her she better play nice 
warning shot this is about getting even 
trump tells the audience that he was mad at hawkins because she allegedly dissed him by declining to introduce him at the event in sydney he tells the audience how mad he was and then says as shes crossing the stage shes my favorite miss universe so she thinks maybe this isnt going to be as bad as she fears 
but then he stabs her publicly for the first time but i think i like the new one better 
the audience loves it he is going to feed them the sexual humiliation of a beautiful woman because she wasnt a good girl she reaches him and they clasp hands while she smiles through the shame knowing she has no choice and wanting to be a good sport 
hawkins tries to make light of the situation while appeasing trump playing along with his game because she has to but there will be no easy way out of this one it wont be enough to fawn over him in front of the audience she will have to pay 
i was actually going to get up and tell you that jennifer is a beautiful girl on the outside but shes not very bright trump tells the audience signaling that hawkins is a piece of meat to be dissected by him publicly for her refusal to give him anything he asks for 
that wouldnt have been true but i would have said it anyway trump proudly tells the audience this is his alpha male routine except in real life the alpha male doesnt have to abuse money and power he inherited in order to win the girl but in the mind of little men like trump this makes him a winner 
trump points out that hawkins is a big star now but he helped her make it and then dissed him he owns her she must comply or face his wrath hawkins tries to say that she did introduce him but trump pushes her away from the microphone this public shaming will be done from trumps pov only no need for hawkins to assert her personhoodthere will be no defense allowed because shes already guilty 
and you know what she came tonight she came  came she came she came trump says gleefully like the drunk pervy uncle everyone tries to avoid at christmas he waits for the audience to join him in his sexual shaming and they do they get it hee heee so clever came knuckles dragging on the floor clever 
see so they have the same filthy minds in australia trump says 
trump grabs hawkins around the waist and forces a kiss on her just like he bragged about doing on the bush tape 
hawkins reflexively turns away and puts her arm between them the kiss misses its mark and lands on her cheek she is hoping this is good enough humiliation for him but putting her foot down on actual mouth contact shes allowed herself to be publicly humiliated to appease him and pretended to fawn over him as required but she will not cannot allow the kiss the repulsive kiss 
im telling this story as i imagine it to be from her point of view although she has refused to comment of course she refused to comment women are told they will be blackballed if they comment the world is full of men like trump and they stick together see roger ailes women have to play along and appease and if that doesnt work they have to allow themselves to be sexually assaulted and humiliated just a little bit in public especially if they said no in private 
i can only do this because i have lived it somewhat like this in public and i have tried to appease the ego of the assaulter in order to keep my job while denying him his assumed entitlement to my body 
from talking to so many women during this election i know that im not alone i know that many other women will watch this and know they will feel the creep of fear and revulsion the deer in the headlights cringe that takes over when you know that you are about to be humiliated as a sexual object because you refused him or refused to appease the ego of the powerful man in charge by behaving like a sexual conquest how dare hawkins have her own life and be unwilling to change all of her plans in order to introduce trump 
and other people will watch this humiliation and enjoy it setting you up to be humiliated even more they will laugh about it and gossip about it which is the social punishment women face when they reject a man like trump ironically if you give in youre not humiliated its only if you say no that you are set up to be publicly flogged as a sex object 
its not just the unwanted kiss although that is disgusting and assault much like donald trump bragged about doing on the billy bush bus tape its the public humiliation and denigration 
its the way the woman is forced in front of thousands of people to try to smile her way through his ambush of verbal and physical assaults as he takes revenge 
its the way she tries to make it okay to sweetsmooth his ego in order to get out of the line of fire and in return he shames her by suggesting he made her come and then grabs her for an unwanted kiss 
if there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the trump candidacy perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all trumps fault its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman 
in fact this is shades of what trump did to hillary clinton in the stalking debate after which he announced that looking at her from behind he was not impressed

life can be tough but students at willow creek elementary school in duluth minnesota have done something this year that will make you cry tears of joy when they noticed that a fellow student wasnt eating lunch at school they brought him so many lunches that he clogged the door and school got canceled 
compassion for the win 
when caring students saw that yearold bryce oswald was showing up to school every day without a lunch they knew they had to do something they started giving bryce fruit snacks and pats of butter from their lunches and even pooled their allowances to buy bryce hoagies and rotisserie chickens in an effort to make sure that he wouldnt go hungry and would instead get massive enough to clog the door to the school and get school canceled 
bryce didnt have anything to eat so we knew we had to help him out said willow creek student kali summers we gave him our lunches every day even if we got really hungry we knew if he kept eating he would get fat enough to clog up the door and we wouldnt have to go to school 
the plan worked perfectly in a matter of months bryce went from having no lunch at all to having so many lunches that he packed on  pounds got stuck in the door and school got canceled the students were so successful in plumping bryce up that it took four firefighters with a jackhammer to finally be able to pry him out 
mission accomplished 
due to these kids selfless dedication not only did bryce not go hungry but all of the kids and teachers were able to stay home from school to play watch tv and relax instead of going to school for a full two days they arent stopping there either even though bryce is now bigger than any other student in the district the kids are going to continue to give him lunches in hopes that he can get stuck in the door so tightly that school gets canceled for a full week

Katie,david fry released from jail,"oregon live  by maxine bernstein 
a federal jury on thursday found ammon bundy his brother ryan bundy and five codefendants not guilty of conspiring to prevent federal employees from doing their jobs through intimidation threat or force during the day occupation of the malheur national wildlife refuge 
the bundy brothers and occupiers jeff banta and david fry also were found not guilty of having guns in a federal facility kenneth medenbach was found not guilty of stealing government property and a hung jury was declared on ryan bundys charge of theft of fbi surveillance cameras 
more than we could have hoped for said one of ammon bundys lawyers j morgan philpot 
stunning said defense lawyer lisa ludwig who was standby counsel for ryan bundy 
im just thrilled said neil wamplers attorney lisa maxfield 
the jury of nine women and three men returned the verdicts after five hours of deliberations on thursday in the highprofile case that riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the federal bird sanctuary in rural eastern oregon 
each defendant stood separately facing the jury as the judge read the verdicts ammon bundy his hands clasped behind his back nodded as the not guilty verdicts were read for him first as he sat he smiled and rubbed the shoulder of his lawyer marcus mumford 
his older brother ryan bundy stood as his not guilty verdicts were read he nodded and mouthed to the jury thank you defendant neil wampler hugged and kissed his defense lawyer maxfield 
the coda to the stunning verdict undoubtedly a significant blow to federal prosecutors was when ammon bundys lawyer marcus mumford argued that his client dressed in a gray suit and white dress shirt should be allowed to walk out of the court a free man 
us district judge anna j brown told him that there was a us marshals hold on him from a pending federal indictment in nevada 
oregon standoff defendant jeff banta is relieved by acquittals 
if theres a detainer show me mumford stood arguing before the judge 
suddenly a group of about six us marshals surrounded mumford at his defense table the judge directed them to move back but moments later the marshals grabbed on to him 
what are you doing mumford yelled as he struggled and was taken down to the floor 
as deputy marshals yelled stop resisting the judge demanded everybody out of the courtroom now 
mumford was taken into custody a member of his legal team confirmed 
ammon bundys lawyer j morgan philpot said afterwards on the courthouse steps that mumford had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun or taser on his back another member of ammon bundys legal team rick koerber echoed philpot saying he heard mumford questioning in court why they were using a taser against him 
philpot decried the marshals treatment of mumford in the courtroom what happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government he said 
by  pm mumford was released from custody he confirmed that he was struck with a stun gun once while he was on the floor of the courtroom 
i grew up on a dairy farm so am i used to some rough treatment sure he said but he said the actions of the us marshals were uncalled for 
all i was asking for was papers just show me you have the authority to take mr bundy into custody 
as to the verdict very pleased very gratified this jury was dedicated they listened to our case 
just after the verdicts were announced people emerged onto the front steps of the courthouse to tell a crowd of media and onlookers 
supporters of the defendants gathered in a joyous hug one of them brand thornton of las vegas one of the original occupiers who accompanied ryan bundy and others onto the refuge on jan  and was called as witness by the defense said that he has been at the trial since oct  
the verdict means everything thornton said its huge for ranchers and land rights within harney county and across the west he said 
we did something peaceful and wanted to stay peaceful said thornton who has kept vigil outside the courthouse blowing a shofar 
this is for the people of oregon thornton said this was never for us 
wampler appeared on the courthouse steps and described the verdict as a stunning victory for rural america 
david frys lawyer per c olson said it was the right result 
i think the jury saw through this that they were wellmeaning wellintentioned individuals olson said the jury saw that the defendants cared about the hammonds and didnt like how the federal government was treating them 
maxfield who represented wampler came out of the courthouse holding up her fists she said she has never seen anything like this happen where multiple defendants in a federal court trial were all acquitted and called it one of the most significant cases in her career 
defendant shawna cox said she had a peaceful feeling as she waited for the verdicts but i didnt expect wed all be found not guilty 
i wept cox said it brings me to tears im so grateful to the jury 
defense lawyer matthew schindler standby counsel to defendant kenneth medenbach who was excused from court because of medical ailments said he called his client right away 
hes been fighting for more than  years to be in a situation where a jury acquitted him schindler said its vindication 
schindler said he believes the jurys verdicts resulted from the difficulty the government had in proving that the intent of the defendants was to conspire against the us fish and wildlife service and us bureau of land management 
the judge gave us broad ability to bring in a defendants state of mind and what you saw was a number of defendants who each had their own motivations schindler said 
when prosecuting a drug conspiracy its easy to point to what the defendants underlying objective is but in this case schindler said there was no obvious underlying self interest he said the defense also was bolstered because the jurors came from different regions from the state and not just from portland 
oregon us attorney billy williams sat in the back of the courtroom with oregons fbi special agent in charge gregg bretzing as the verdicts were read williams left the courtroom early before the scrum with mumford to attend a gathering of the league of minority voters in salem thursday night 
harney county sheriff dave ward who was the face of law enforcement during the day refuge takeover said in a statement while i am disappointed in the outcome i believe our form of government and justice system to be the best in the world these folks were tried in a court of law and found not guilty by a jury of their peers this is our system and i stand by it 
the fiveweek trial offered a rare display three of the seven defendants chose to represent themselves five of them were among the more than  people who took the witness stand to testify 
and one of the original  jurors was dismissed after a fellow juror raised concerns about his impartiality four days into an initial round of deliberations  what the judge called an extraordinary circumstance an alternate juror was summoned to begin a new round of deliberations with the remaining  jurors thursday morning 
there was heightened security in and around the courthouse throughout the trial with security officers ordered to wear bulletproof vests and metal detectors set up outside the main trial courtroom and an overflow room with a live video feed of the proceedings 
often supporters knelt in prayer in the courthouse corridor before the trial began in the mornings and some kept vigil across the street with one fellow occupier blowing a rams horn or shofar as the jury deliberated 
pending prosecutions 
the seven on trial were among  people indicted on the conspiracy charge 
eleven of them pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge 
seven others are set for trial on feb  but their cases may be affected by the verdicts if convictions are handed down in this case then defendants scheduled for trial in february might consider potential pleas if there are acquittals prosecutors may rethink going to trial on same charges against codefendants next year 
on the eve of jury selection in this case prosecutors agreed to dismiss the conspiracy charge against pete santilli an independent broadcaster and selfdescribed shock jock who provided live stream footage of the occupation 
nevada case 
ammon bundy and ryan bundy also face prosecution in nevada in the  standoff with federal agents over the impounding of their fathers cattle near bunkerville nevada 
the trial there is set to start feb  the two brothers and father cliven bundy are among  indicted in nevada others from the oregon refuge occupation also indicted on federal charges in nevada are pete santilli ryan payne brian cavalier blaine cooper and joseph oshaughnessy 
payne pleaded guilty to the federal conspiracy charge in oregon under a potential global agreement that was in the works with nevada prosecutors but he recently asked to withdraw the oregon plea because no deal was reached in nevada prosecutors in portland have until oct  to respond 
cooper entered guilty pleas in both cases oshaughnessy pleaded guilty in the oregon case with a deal pending in nevada cavalier pleaded guilty in the oregon case

this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi 
apparently hillary is not the only person in washington who has made plans to escape justice under a trump administration john kerry has quietly been selling his property in the us for millions of dollars of late with an announcement of the sale of his  million dollar nantucket mansion in june  as well as the sale of his yacht for  million in july  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january  another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true

Dr. Patrick Slattery,dr duke and pastor dankof quote jews boasting of jewish media power," views share by dr david duke when i was first began to understand the ultraracist supremacist ideology of judaism and zionism i came into contact with the theory that presentday jews are genetically unrelated to the historical jewish community the allegation known as the khazar theory claims that the ashkenazim jews of today are actually the descendants of the khazar people a central asiatic nomadic tribe that allegedly converted to judaism in the th century ad it is claimed that these newlyminted jews then migrated into what is now russia eastern europe and later western and northern europe the theory is also used to advance the idea that jewish actions are character are not genetic or racial because the khazar people adopted the talmudic values of shephardic and other jews who were unrelated to them interestingly enough the khazar theory was launched and is still to this day driven primarily by communist jews and other jews who promote it in the gentile community as a refutation that the jews cant be racist because they are not a race it is ironic that the three most prominent exponents of the theory that the jews are not a race all have almost exaggerated caricatures of features people ascribe as jewish above left to right zionist extremist and communist party member arthur koestler author of the the thirteenth tribe jewish geneticist eran elhaik and shlomo sand an israeli academic and former member of the union of israeli communist youth banki all three maintain that large numbers of presentday jews are completely genetically unrelated to the middle easternorigin jews who wrote the babylonian talmud 
for years i accepted the khazar theory as true after it all it was repeated by some writers who also recognized the leading jewish role in communism and their leadership in many other subversive movements it was only later when i considered the question logically and scientifically were my doubts about the khazar theory aroused one thing that i did not know then was that koestler the communist jew who popularized the khazar theory bragged in a jewish magazine that he advanced the theory as way to fight against antisemitism his theory was that since the gospels and europeans blamed jews for the crucifixion of jesus christ if he could make europeans believe that they are not related by blood to the christkiller jews talked about in the new testament that he could lessen hatred against jews one must remember until the jewish triumph of christian zionism  percent of christianity viewed jews as the greatest enemies of jesus christ and god as the new testament makes very very clear so in those days some jews such as koestler saw an advantage to say that the jews were not actually related to the jews who crucified christ and so persecuted christians koestlers official biography written by michael scammell specifically quotes him on why he wrote the thirteenth tribe  his argument was that if he could persuade people that a nonjewish khazar heritage formed the basis of modern jews then this would be a weapon against european raciallybased antisemitism should this theory be confirmed the term antisemitism would become void of meaning he said according to scammell koestler told french biologist pierre debrayritzen he was convinced that if he could prove that the bulk of eastern european jews were descended from the khazars the racial basis for antisemitism would be removed and antisemitism itself could disappear source scammell michael koestler the literary and political odyssey of a twentiethcentury skeptic random house  isbn  p  in the s the khazar theory was also promoted by benjamin friedman a prominent rich jew who converted to christianity and turned against the jews it was certainly selfserving for him to promote the idea that jewishness was mostly cultural and religious and not racial in nature therefore facilitating more acceptance of him there are three fundamental issues which need to addressed the scientific evidence

eastern nonjewish populations share a common pool of ychromosome biallelic haplotypes  mf hammer etal proceedings of the us national academy of sciences  doi pnas  found that despite their longterm residence in different countries and isolation from one another most jewish populations were not significantly different from one another at the genetic level admixture estimates suggested low levels of european ychromosome gene flow into ashkenazi and roman jewish communities    jewish and middle eastern nonjewish populations were not statistically different the results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of jewish communities from europe north africa and the middle east descended from a common middle eastern ancestral population and suggest that most jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring nonjewish communities during and after the diaspora  a november  study titled the y chromosome pool of jews as part of the genetic landscape of the middle east  almut nebel et al american journal of human genetics nov     found that in most jewish populations male line ancestors appear to have been mainly middle eastern the study found that ashkenazi jews in particular share more common paternal lineages with other jewish and middle eastern groups than with nonjewish populations in areas where jews lived in eastern europe germany and the french rhine valley this is consistent with jewish traditions in placing most jewish paternal origins in the region of the middle east  a september  study titled european population substructure

jewish ancestry intermediate between middle eastern and european populations  naama m kopelman etal bmc genetics    doi   found that  jewish populations show a high level of genetic similarity to each

previously unrecognized genetic substructure within the middle east and that most jewish samples form a remarkably tight subcluster and that traces the origins of most jewish diaspora communities to

structure of the genomes in jewish populations and is an outgrowth of the human hapmap project according to this project jewish populations are remarkable for maintaining continuous genetic cultural and religious traditions over  years despite residence all over the world its findings based on first hand dna studies amongst jewish populations around the globe found no evidence to support a central asian dna origin for jewry according to the jerusalem post the jewish hapmap project in new york city has so far shown in exquisite detail what had been conjectured for a century jewish populations from the major jewish diaspora groups  ashkenazi sephardic and mizrahi  form a distinctive population cluster that is closely related to semitic and european populations within this larger jewish cluster each of the jewish populations formed its own subcluster a high degree of mixing of ashkenazi sephardi italian and syrian jews caused them to become more closely related to each other

ashkenazim jews have  european admixture both the behar study section  above and the atzmon study section  above were commented upon by the british former deputy editor of the journal nature  and currently the scientific correspondent for the n ew york times  nicholas wade in an article in that newspaper as follows jewish communities in europe and the middle east share many genes inherited from the ancestral jewish population that lived in the middle east some  years ago even though each community also carries genes from other sources  usually the country in which it lives adding that a major surprise from both surveys is the genetic closeness of the two jewish communities of europe the ashkenazim and the sephardim wade pointed out that the two studies refute the suggestion made by the historian shlomo sand in his book the invention of the jewish people that jews have no common origin but are a miscellany of people in europe and central asia who converted to judaism at various times jewish communities from europe the middle east and the caucasus all have substantial genetic ancestry that traces back to the levant ethiopian jews and two judaic communities in india are genetically much closer to their host populations wade wrote the shared genetic elements suggest that members of any jewish community are related to one another as closely as are fourth or fifth cousins in a large population which is about  times higher than the relationship between two people chosen at random off the streets of new york city ashkenazic and sephardic jews have roughly  percent european ancestry with most of the rest from the middle east the two surveys find the two communities seem very similar to each other genetically which is unexpected because they have been separated for so long  studies show jews genetic similarity nicholas wade new york times june    eran elhaiks single study attempts to refute the mass of earlier dna evidence the mass of dna and genetic evidence is therefore overwhelmingly indicative that despite a certain amount of european admixture among ashkenazim jewry there is still a clearly definable middle eastern genetic component to both ashkenazim and sephardic jewry despite all of these studiesand many more too numerous to list individually herein december  a single individual by the name of eran elhaik from the johns hopkins university school of medicine attempted to refute all of the above mentioned evidence his paper titled the missing link of jewish european ancestry contrasting the rhineland and the khazarian hypotheses was published in the journal genome biological evolution    doi gbeevs  in a nutshell elhaikwhose rather obviously jewish physical appearance should by itself indicate that there is indeed a common jewish type how else can many jews be physically recognized as jewsargues that his method of doing comparative studies between presentday central asian populations ashkenazim jews and nonjewish test groups proves that ashkenazim jews are a hotchpotch of genetic origins with a strong link to what he identifies as the khazar tribe even though elhaiks work is the only single paper as opposed to literally dozens of opposing dna studies written by a single jewish individual as opposed to the other papers which were written by dozens and dozens of scientists from around the globe jewish and nonjewish alike it has quickly become the mostquoted proof of the khazar theory critical errors in elhaiks paper elhaiks paper has a number of errors some small and a number of major ones but they are all serious because even the small errors cast doubt on his academic ability and motivation for example his paper discusses in detail what he sees as the geographic origin of the khazarsyet he completely misidentifies the geographic location of one of his test sample groups the mbuti and biaka pygmies these two groups elhaik asserts at least twice are to be found in south africa actually the mbuti and biaka pygmies are nowhere near south africa and are only to be found literally half a continent away in the congo while this may seem a small error it does indicate sloppiness in research which certainly does not bode well for the rest of the paper this sloppiness is again repeated when elhaik asserts that eastern and central european jews account for approximately  of over  million worldwide jews in reality the figure is far less of the estimated  million jews worldwide  million are ashkenazim and  million are sephardic a division of  european jews to  noneuropean jews and it should be pointed out that the zionist state of israel actually has a sephardic and mizrahi nonashkenazi jewish majority among jews these actual facts on jewish ethnicity are readily available and elhaiks motivation for making this clearly false claim could only be ascribed to a desire to underscore his general assertion namely that most jews are not middle eastern in origin and that jews are not race or a genetically similar people the most important error in elhaiks paper however is actually openly admitted namely that there is actually no khazar dna in existence against which any sort of measurement can be taken elhaik himself admits this in his paper the khazars have been vanquished and their remains have yet to be sequenced   in other words there is no record of what exactly khazar dna might have been as there is no record of what khazar dna isit is ipso facto physically impossible to determine who is descended from it and who is not elhaik attempts to circumvent this major problem by selecting what he calls surrogate populationsin this case contemporary middle eastern and caucasus populations anyone with a basic understanding of historical events in the caucasus in particular will immediately see that elhaiks assertion that current populations in that region can be taken to reflect those of  years ago is highly problematic and quite simply unsustainable the caucasus a region at the border of europe and asia situated between the black and the caspian seas has been crisscrossed by numerous peoples and races over the last  years ranging from indoeuropeans semites mongols and othersand is today highly genetically diverse a claim that dna samples from this region can be taken as any sort of dna yardstick is dubious to say the very least finally elhaiks methodology in comparing the dna samples is to make an understatement unique to him as marcus feldman director of stanford universitys morrison institute for population and resource studies said he elhaik appears to be applying the statistics in a way that gives him different results from what everybody else has obtained from essentially similar data  jews a race genetic theory comes under fierce attack by dna expert the jewish daily forward may    interestingly the study which was cited in the new york times of the jews as a race is exactly the same conclusion that was reached by german national socialist anthropologists and other experts who studied race science in the united states and elsewhere also many of the presentday extensive studies have been carried out by both gentile and jewish geneticists alike obviating any claims of racial bias elhaiks theory is completely refuted by the new most massive and most complete study ever done of the jewish genome one of elhaiks arguments was that the previous studies referenced above were done in the pregenomewide era using uniparental markers and including different reference populationsimplying that their results are not in line with the most modern dna sequencing methodology in fact at least one studywhich appeared after elhaiks work was first publishedhas confirmed the accuracy of the original studies and also completely refuted elhaiks hypothesis titled no evidence from genomewide data of a khazar origin for the ashkenazi jews this study was published by the journal human biology in august  behar doron m etal human biology access preprints paper   this paper emphasized the serious error with elhaiks work because the khazar population has left no obvious modern descendants that could enable a clear test for a contribution to ashkenazi jewish ancestry the khazar hypothesis has been difficult to examine using genetics furthermore because only limited genetic data have been available from the caucasus region and because these data have been concentrated in populations that are genetically close to populations from the middle east the attribution of any signal of ashkenazicaucasus genetic similarity to khazar ancestry rather than shared ancestral middle eastern ancestry has been problematic this latest most massive study of the jewish genome was a worldwide effort of geneticists both gentile and jewish to analyze jewish genetics researchers from laboratories around the globe including estonia russia italy greece bosnia and herzegovina croatia armenia the us and israel gathered together the largest jewish dna data set ever yet assembled the paper explained as follows here through integration of genotypes on newly collected samples with data from several of our past studies we have assembled the largest data set available to date for assessment of ashkenazi jewish genetic origins employing a variety of standard techniques for the analysis of population genetic structure we find that ashkenazi jews share the greatest genetic ancestry with other jewish populations and among nonjewish populations with groups from europe and the middle east no particular similarity of ashkenazi jews with populations from the caucasus is evident particularly with the populations that most closely represent the khazar region thus analysis of ashkenazi jews together with a large sample from the region of the khazar khaganate corroborates the earlier results that ashkenazi jews derive their ancestry primarily from populations of the middle east and europe that they possess considerable shared ancestry with other jewish populations and that there is no indication of a significant genetic contribution either from within or from north of the caucasus region the latest most uptodate and modern dna analysis has therefore completely refuted the khazar theory it is important to understand that this refutation has come from nonjewish and jewish scientists from dozens of different universities and geneticists all over the world and cannot be ascribed to a conspiracy part ii the historicallogical evidence the historical record shows jewish physical consistency one of the most obvious indicators of genetic commonality is physical appearance european people broadly resemble each other african people broadly resemble each other chinese people broadly resemble each other australian aborigines broadly resemble each other and so on it is a characteristic of genetically similar people to physically resemble each other jews are no different in this regard to any other people they too show a resemblance to each otherthis is why it is possible to often recognize a jewish person by his physical appearance a good example in point is the already mentioned jewish geneticist eran elhaik who despite physically embodying a jewish sterrotype recognized around the world tries to claim that there is no genetic commonality amongst jews the khazar theory holds that most ashkenazim jews are not semitic but are central asian converts to judaism proponents of the khazar theory fail to understand the logical consequence of their beliefnamely that a supposed central asian origin of most ashkenazim jews means that they will not physically resemble other jews as anyone can see this is not the case sephardic jews are on average slightly darker than ashkenazim jews but there is no doubt that there is a physical similarity which allows them still to be recognized as such above these two illustrations make the point even more dramatically on the left the ashkenazim jewess barbara streisand new york  on the right a jewish leader of israelite trade delegation as portrayed on a mural on the wall of the th dynasty  bc tomb of sobekhotep thutmose iv egypt two thousand years before the alleged khazar conversion and they look the same as modern ashkenazi jews streisands paternal grandparents came from galicia polandukraine and her maternal grandparents came from russiaif anyone would be khazar according to that theory it would be her nonetheless she closely resembles the only designated jew as portrayed on an egyptian tomb from  years ago the leader of a jewish trade delegation to egypt the genetic continuity is clearand if the khazar theory was true there would be no physical similarity because there would have been a racial sea change in jewish appearance left the famous banker of pompeii jucundus who lived circa  ad  years before the alleged ashkenazi conversion identified as a jew by the german anthropologist hans fk günther in his book  racial elements of european history fig a and b chapter viii  alongside the ashkenazi jew abe foxman of the adl the similarity between jucundus and foxman is clear and serves a further indication of the physical continuity of the jewish type over centuriessomething that would be impossible if the khazar theory was true in addition to genetic studies there have been extensive physiological comparison of jewish remains from burial sites from ancient israel and presentday ashkenazi and sephardic physiology all of which conclusively shows their similarity across both the sephardic and ashkenazi spectrumand their difference from european populations jewish supremacist behavior through the millennia disprove the khazar theory another piece of the jigsaw which disproves the khazar theory is that jewish supremacist behavior has remained constant throughout the millenniafrom biblical times right through to the present day most christians are aware of the behavior of the old testament jewswho burn rampage kill rape and enslave their way through palestine supposedly on order of their tribal god they are aware of the fact that the gospels of the new testament show that elite of the jews the pharisees were the biggest enemies of christ and arranged for his crucifixion and the new testament is clear that they led the persecution of christians which has continued through both jewish bolshevism and the cultural assault in the zio global media it must also be clear that the talmud the books of jewish law promoting jewish extremist supremacism and hatred against all nonjews was written hundreds of years before any alleged khazar conversion while it another debate altogether as to the historical accuracy of those events there is no question about jewish interaction with gentilesand romans in particularduring the first century ad the worlds first antijewish riots broke out in the city of alexandria in  ad and reoccurred in  ad  ad  ad and  ad in that year the archbishop of alexandria cyril ordered the expulsion of all jews from the city the roman historian socrates of constantinople not be confused with the socrates of classical greece in his ecclesiastical history recorded the reasons for this first great expulsion of jews from a nonjewish city in detail and reveals behavior by jewish supremacists exactly as the world experiences it today over  years later   the jews were continually factious and there was added to their ordinary hatred of the christians    cyril on being informed of this sent for the principal jews and threatened them with the utmost severities unless they desisted from their molestation of the christians these menaces instead of suppressing their violence only rendered the jewish populace more furious and led them to form conspiracies for the destruction of the christians one of which was of so desperate a character as to cause their entire expulsion from alexandria socrates hist eccl vii  pc lxxxii  ff the very first jewish community outside of the middle east was established in rome in  bcand it was not long before their activities roused roman public opinion against them the famous orator cicero among others frequently spoke against the presence of jews during sittings of the roman senate in his famous pro flacco oration which dealt with the case of a roman aristocrat lucius valerius flaccus accused of unlawfully confiscating jewish money cicero said now let us take a look at the jews and their mania for gold you chose this site chief prosecutor laelius and the crowd which frequents it with an eye to this particular accusation knowing very well that jews with their large numbers and tendency to act as a clique are valuable supporters to have at any kind of public meeting many other prominent and famous romans such as seneca juneval and tacitus all went on record as complaining about the activities of jews within the roman empire the roman historian tacitus in his most famous work histories described the activities of the jews as follows in order to secure the allegiance of his people in the future moses prescribed for them a novel religion quite different from those of the rest of mankind among the jews all things are profane that we hold sacred on the other hand they regard as permissible what seems to us immoral    the other practices of the jews are sinister and revolting and have entrenched themselves by their very wickedness wretches of the most abandoned kind who had no use for the religion of their fathers took to contributing dues and freewill offerings to swell the jewish exchequer and other reasons for their increasing wealth may be found in their stubborn loyalty and ready benevolence towards brother jews but the rest of the world they confront with the hatred reserved for enemies they will not feed or intermarry with gentiles though a most lascivious people the jews avoid sexual intercourse with women of alien race among themselves nothing is barred they have introduced the practice of circumcision to show that they are different from others tacitus histories  the famous british historian edward gibbon in his monumental work the decline and fall of the roman empire lippincourt philadelphia  vol  page  discussed jewish supremacist behavior in roman times this way from the reign of nero to that of antoninus pius the jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of rome which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections humanity is shocked at the recital of horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of egypt of cyria and of cyrene where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the roman government but of all human kind antijewish literature during roman times was very widespread one work by the greek apion was so wellknown that the romanized jewish historian josephus who wrote the famous account of the jewish uprising of  ad called the jewish wars wrote an entire book trying to refute apions arguments the roman emperor tiberius formally expelled the jews from rome in  ad they returned shortly thereafter only to be expelled once again in  ad in  ad emperor trajan ordered that all jews in mesopotamia should be killed saying that they were the cause of continual uprisings in that region one of the most famous emperors of the eastern roman empire justinian  ad adopted a comprehensive antijewish policy which barred jews from the civil service military posts and any other positions of influence in his government all of these events predate the supposed khazar conversion by centuriesyet it can be seen that the identical behavioral patterns are on display before and

No Author,trump supporters booby trap polling place and spill blood of election volunteer video  addicting info  the knowledge you crave,"on november    pm  
weve all seen pictures of the trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor complete with their young son barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents its a life most of us can never imagine while were paying our monthly bills so whats it like growing up with donald trump as a father according to scott melker a former classmate of donald trump jrs at the university of pennsylvania being the former reality show stars son wasnt what one might imagine or given trumps temperament it might be exactly what youd imagine 
on facebook  mekler told of the animosity trumps son had for this father 
i was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends next door to donald jrs room i walked out of the room to find donald trump at his sons door there to pick him up for a baseball game he recalls there were quite a few students standing around watching trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate don jr opened the door wearing a yankee jersey 
then mekler told of the moment trump slapped his son in the face in front of others 
without saying a word his father slapped him across the face knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates he simply said put on a suit and meet me outside and closed the door melker wrote 
donald jr was a drunk in college every memory i have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking he continued he absolutely despised his father and hated the attention that his last name afforded him his nickname was diaper don because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other peoples beds and urinate i always felt terrible for him he continued 
mekler said part of his reason for voting for hillary clinton is because in light of what i saw that day it is clear to me that donald trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country 
to be clear we are not demonizing trumps son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days whether melkers story is accurate or not were not sure but given trumps awful temper its difficult to discount it

Adan Salazar,breaking fbi reopens investigation into clinton emails,"the email that got john podesta hacked latest wikileaks dump reveals phishing email that compromised podesta mikael thalen  october   comments 
the email that lead to the hack of clinton campaign chairman john podestas gmail account was published online friday by wikileaks 
the malicious march  email which claims to be from google asked podesta to change his password due to unauthorized access from an ip address in the ukraine 
clinton campaign staff members who viewed the email were convinced it was genuine clinton insider sara latham argued the gmail one is real while even clinton campaign it specialist charles delavan said this is a legitimate email 
the first suspicious aspect of the email unnoticed by the clinton camp was the bitly password reset link bitly a website that shortens long web addresses would not be found in an official email from google 
as first reported by motherboard earlier this month examination of the bitly link that redirected podesta to a fake google webpage also contained several red flags 
the bitly link helped hide not only the fact that the landing page ended in tk instead of com but that the web page itself failed to use https encryption such links were also likely used to fool googles spam filters 
prior analysis of the phishing link by cybersecurity group secureworks revealed the hackers also made a significant operation security mistake  they failed to make their two bitly accounts private 
the public accounts revealed the hackers had created  similar links to use against  gmail accounts between october  and may  
secureworks notes that the targets included individuals in russia and the former soviet states current and former military and government personnel in the us and europe individuals working in the defense and government supply chain and authors and journalists 
accounts linked to the  election were also in the hackers sights 
specific targets include staff working for or associated with hillary clintons presidential campaign and the democratic national committee dnc including individuals managing clintons communications travel campaign finances and advising her on policy 
thomas rid a professor at kings college displayed on twitter how decoding the phishing links could reveal the specific emails being targeted 
click to enlarge interestingly former secretary of state colin powell whose emails were released by the website dcleaks in september was also targeted by the same hackers 
click to enlarge this connection suggests the hackers who provided wikileaks with the podesta emails and dcleaks with the powell emails are likely one in the same the bitly accounts are also behind the malicious email sent to retired fourstar general philip mark breedlove  whose emails appeared on dcleaks in april 
numerous cybersecurity groups have accused the russian government of being responsible not only for the above election season hacks but for creating dcleaks and guccifer  to disseminate the data the us government also publicly blamed russia on october  just one week before the cia was tasked with preparing a possible retaliatory  cyber strike  
russian president vladimir putin has denied involvement arguing that the contents of the hacks are far more important than who is responsible 
listen does it even matter who hacked this data putin said on september  the important thing is the content that was given to the public 
putin again dismissed us hysteria concerning the hacks on thursday during an annual speech at the valdai discussion club in sochi 
hysteria has been whipped up in the united states about the influence of russia over the us presidential election he said its much simpler to distract people with socalled russian hackers spies and agents of influence does anyone really think that russia could influence the american peoples choice in any way is america a banana republic or what america is a great power newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,5.169608718030007,54,7,4027,640,5.2375,640.0,-0.2433532738279656,-0.5778293249656962,0.2773246740423365,0.2253608542138888,0.1464344457353105,0.2422271217062552,0.0015625,0.0,0.0015625,0,0,0.0,0.0027668165193971,-0.9675,0.057,0.086,0.857,Negative,Very Strong
admin,trump warns of vote flipping on machines,"home this month popular feminism has lost the minds of young women feminism has lost the minds of young women maximus decimus meridius 
maximus is a man capital m period love truth justice liberty respect these are the lodestones pointing true to magnetic masculinity in a polarized feminist west his goal for writing on rok is to be the gadfly that provokes thought and counters groupthink october   the sexes 
the idea that feminism is dead is gaining ground all across the west one would like to think it is because of the trail blazing of the manosphere and to a great degree it is but truly the root of feminisms death was in man capital m from the very beginning one look at conan is all a man needs to know this truth 
feminism is dead the movement is absolutely dead 
the womens movement tried to suppress dissident voices for way too long theres no room for dissent its just like mean girls 
if they had listened to me they could have gotten the ship steered in the right direction my wing of feminismthe prosex wingwas silenced i was practically lynched for endorsing the rolling stones susan faludi is still saying im not a feminist who made her pope 
feminist ideology is like a new religion for a lot of neurotic women you cant talk to them about anything 
 camille paglia on rob ford rihanna and rape culture for macleansca 
neurotic women indeed 
paul joseph watson of infowarsprison planet fame was bang on in his assessment of feminism at the end of  but he may have underestimated his conclusions in my opinion feminists did not just lose the debate they lost the war 
the feminist attempt to demonize normal malefemale behaviour in public men initiating contact with a female with a hello and attempt to strike up a conversation backfired in less than a month 
when you have a woman volunteer to walk down the street as princess leia the queen of s patriarchal sexist misogyny to ridicule feminists you have lost the war for hearts and minds 
and when i say hearts and minds i mean the silent majority of young women who want nothing to do with feminism 
leia makes it clear in this video that boys will be boys so too will jawas darth vader and even yoda apparently that sly dude who knew 
and thats a good thing men and women are meant to interact and engage in romantic courtship feminists may hate this but the vast majority of women still prefer and expect the man to take the initiative to get the girl this is how men and women were created and evolved you cant fight darwin and god and come out on top 
this video shows that the majority of normal women love male attention they want men to look at them they want men to notice them why 
they want a man 
i realized this is the case when i decided to google the fast rising phenomenon of women against feminism  
this image from the women against feminism tumblr page really hits home the loss for feminism this woman was raped she is not running around spreading lies like the uva rape hoax story that rolling stone ran and had to retract  she justs wants to go back to living a normal life she does not want to be angry at all men for the crime of one of them she does not want to demonize all men in some sad attempt to get revenge she does not want to be a victim feminists have lost the female youth of millenials the very generation that is supposed to obliterate the patriarchy completely in the st century 
i understand some men who are still angry over feminism may proclaim these women are doing nothing more than crying for sympathy and attention now that millenial men have become vocal blunt and merciless in their attacks against feminism and the current generation of women it has reared  the problem with this type of kneejerk reaction is just thatyoure being a jerk yes far too many western women for comfort are no good for a relationship anymore but that does not also translate into there being no young women who are not just as frustrated and angry at feminism as you are and the feminists who claim to speak for them 
young women might not think about it as much since feminism has clearly made the road to independence an illusion easier for them to choose but these women are taking note that men are completely ignoring them now that they have surpassed men in almost all aspects of western society 
case in point 
i met a wonderful young russian blonde a little while back twentythree tight feminine so freaking perfect we hit it off immediately on first contact having myself only traveled outside the west twice i still primarily meet foreign women in my own country and every time i do i am blown away by their immediate friendliness and ease in my company compared to western girls as i conversed with this well educated and refined young russian lady she told me she was attending university and so naturally i asked her what she noticed most about the boys on campus compared to back home 
her answer was revealing boys they completely ignore the girls dont even look at them just walk on by 
this really surprised her being a feminine russian girl who expects men to look at women this behaviour by western men was completely alien to her 
men young boys in their prime s completely ignoring women on campus as they go about their day 
according to wikipedia women against feminism started on tumblr in   i see womenagainstfeminism as a sign that many young women are fed up with feminism and male bashing in western society it is not a sign of women speaking with two faces and trying to work both sides of the gender war to their advantage all you have to do is look into the eyes of this young woman to know just how desperate these girls are for a real relationship one with love and respect  i dont think men realize how significant a movement like women against feminism is 
as men we are naturally comfortable with open conflict and expressing not just dissenting but offensive opinions the very existence of women openly declaring they are rejecting feminism and risking social ostracism in a wholly feminist dominated university climate is why feminists are hyperventilating and going into apeshit mentally insane overdrive mode to try and salvage what support they have left  here are just a few mainstream articles trying to push the meme feminism is not dead and just needs a generational adjustment",prisonplanet.com,Fake,english,20.8,12.500754447675927,40,7,6322,1136,4.532570422535211,1136.0,-0.671403824631123,-0.5778293249656962,0.8845166555868622,1.0029305260855332,-0.5492619143192412,1.0379760674868688,0.0035211267605633,0.0,0.0026408450704225,0,0,0.0,0.006005602260419,-0.9958,0.12,0.15,0.73,Negative,Very Strong
Jimmy Rustling,the amish in america commit their vote to donald trump mathematically guaranteeing him a presidential victory  abc news," share president obama has signed an executive order declaring an investigation into the election results and plans for a revote on december th ap photo  dennis system 
washington dc ap  following the results of tuesday nights election president obama has signed executive order   which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on december  th  obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day  too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted  equipment failures as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically 
people all over the country have been flooding my office with calls telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers obama told reporters many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a hillary clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as president this was especially bad in areas of florida and north carolina where there are high numbers of latino and african american voters we must investigate these claims the margin of victory is too close to call and the outcome of this election is too important there is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for trump 
under the presidents order the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted and all poll workers who took part in tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks this process is expected to take  days in precincts where the department of justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred new elections will be held on dec  th with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college 
not surprisingly donald trump is not happy with the presidents decision 
crooked hillary lost this election fair and square they tried to rig this election against me but the american people didnt allow that to happen president obama doesnt care about what the american people want i said the system was rigged all along and this proves i was right 
the president also said that the doj will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college 
we have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states we still need to investigate these claims but if they are true we will take all the appropriate actions necessary 
paul horner a professor of political science at ucla believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election 
most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the united states but there is nothing in the constitution that says that hillary clinton won the popular vote by more than  votes  but because of the electoral college she still lost that decision is reserved solely for the  electors who meet in their respective states on december  th  what the people are actually voting for are their states electors not for the president though the system is odd and unfair it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching that does not mean however that it will continue to work just fine in the future the way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways this recent election being one of them 
political analyst matt daemon told abc news that he agrees with the presidents executive order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether 
the electoral college is a fking joke we should be using the popular vote instead it may have made sense in  but so did the three fifths compromise  everyone should have an equal vote and thats just not the case with the electoral college you know what the electoral college gave us it gave us george w bush it gave us a war in iraq and the worst recession since the great depression its time to bring our system into the  st century i hope obama fixes this because president trump is going to be a nightmare 
obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward 
were going to investigate the fbi into their role in all of this obama said why did fbi director james comey on sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against clinton after reviewing all of her emails declaring hillary clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election why wasnt this news released earlier how many votes were lost because of this obama said if all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in december a recount will be ordered

No Author,irans carpet exports to us at mn,"politics former british prime minister tony blair says uk voters have to build the capability to mobilize and to organize against brexit 
former british prime minister tony blair says britain should keep its options open on whether or not to leave the european union until after brexit talks with the bloc are completed 
during an interview on friday with bbc radio s today program blair described the eu referendum as a catastrophe and said uk voters should be given the option of a second eu referendum 
britain should not withdraw from the eu until it becomes clearer how brexit would impact uks economic social and cultural future blair said 
the bizarre thing about this referendum is that we took a decision but we still dont know the precise terms he said theres got to be some way either through parliament or through an election possibly through another referendum that people express their view 
the former premier who was in office from  until  said it should be possible for the public to switch their verdict if it becomes clear the alternative negotiated by prime minister theresa may is going to be worse 
blairs argument contrasts sharply with that of may who has repeatedly said that brexit means brexit and that shell respect the referendum result blair had argued that britain should stay in the eu before the referendum 
economic growth in the uk is expected to slow significantly next year due to uncertainty over of the brexit vote 
experts have warned that leaving the eu will severely hurt londons position as a financial hub unless the uk decides to keep its access to the single eu market by loosening its stance on immigration

Jon Bowne,the great american screwjob,"schools all over america are closing on election day due to fears of violence all it is going to take is a single incident to change everything image credits flickr calibeach  
will this be the most chaotic election day in modern american history 
all across the nation schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears traditionally schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people they usually have lots of parking and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily but now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place according to fox news  voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on election day at schools in illinois maine nebraska new hampshire ohio pennsylvania wisconsin and elsewhere just a couple days ago  i shared with you a survey that found that  percent of all americans are concerned about violence happening on election day and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach november th 
many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence the following comes from fox news  
several schools across the nation have decided to close on election day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail 
the fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways endangering students 
if anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election then they arent paying much attention ed tolan the falmouth maine police chief said tuesday his community has already called off classes on nov  and an increased police presence will be felt around town 
and without a doubt voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security we have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past but we also need to realize that times have changed i believe that there is wisdom in what georgia secretary of state brian kemp told reporters  
there is a concern just like at a concert sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have  or  years ago said georgia secretary of state brian kemp cochairman of the national association of secretaries of state election committee  what if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something if that happens at a school then thats certainly concerning 
all it is going to take is a single incident to change everything 
let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that 
another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud this is something that donald trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail for instance just consider what he told a rally in pennsylvania  
we dont want to lose an election because you know what im talking about trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in manheim pa earlier this month because you know what thats a big big problem and nobody wants to talk about it nobody has the guts to talk about it so go and watch these polling places  
and of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines in illinois this week one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from republicans to democrats 
early voting in illinois got off to a rocky start monday as votes being cast for republican candidates were transformed into votes for democrats 
republican state representative candidate jim moynihan went to vote monday at the schaumburg public library 
i tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent moynihan said you could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when i tried to vote for a republican and the machine registered a vote for a democrat 
in addition if you keep up with my work on the economic collapse blog  then you already know that a number of voters down in texas have reported that their votes were switched from donald trump to hillary clinton  
well it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the clinton foundation  
according to opensecrets the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of the mccarthy group 
the mccarthy group is a major donor to the clinton foundation  apparently donating  dollars in   when it was the largest owner of united states voting machines or perhaps the  dollars went to paying bill clinton for speeches 
either way it doesnt look good 
after everything that we saw in   i am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines 
but democrats dont like poll observers because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters 
its unamerican but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that  ari berman author of the  book  give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in america  previously told the christian science monitor voting was very very dangerous i dont think anyones suggesting that were at the same place today i just think the loss of the official poll observers is going to be really problematic 
without a doubt this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades and i have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier 
but will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country  
if that is the outcome after all that we have been through it will be exceedingly depressing indeed newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,3.528806933996037,27,4,5999,1036,4.738416988416988,1036.0,-1.0688793360911977,-1.141531470845462,0.7990600063324474,0.8461624470791533,-0.3461115413008314,0.8775428122891643,0.0019305019305019,0.0,0.0019305019305019,0,0,0.0,0.003418460564506,-0.9769,0.076,0.094,0.83,Negative,Very Strong
Jack McLeod,no title,"print 
have you ever noticed how washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own 
for the federal government its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar 
you will recall of course how former attorney general eric holder was going to stop police shootings all over america with sensitivity training the power and force of the federal government and investigations investigations and more investigations 
now loretta lynch his successor also known as hillary clintons guardian angel is set to turn police shootings throughout america into big business and more power for washington 
her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians she reported this month 
accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about communitypolice relations lynch said in the days ahead the department of justice will continue to work alongside our local state tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive useful and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve 
the irony here is thick indeed 
one of lynchs goals she says is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them 
meanwhile lynch presides over the most egregious coverup of the most outrageous police shooting case i have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of miriam carey a young black mother with baby in tow who was gunned down by washington cops and secret service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital 
lynch wants reports 
so does wnd which has been pursuing the information through freedom of information act requests and finally after being stonewalled for years a lawsuit 
so does the public and the family of miriam carey unfortunately lynch is holding back on a few things missing evidence the page memo with findings analysis of evidence and conclusions in the carey shooting investigation this would show the evidence and reasoning that led the department of justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have based on the evidence why officers used deadly force whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies video of shooting at capitol police guard post at intersection of constitution ave maryland ave and nd street only stills have been released video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger as doj claimed when he fired fatal shot to careys head not one of the five witnesses at the scene said carey was driving at the officer as the doj claimed police statements the police report said four officers fired shots at carey two from the capitol police and two from the secret service not one statement from those officers was in the report their names were also redacted redacted information an attorney in the washington dc mayors office said the only redactions were names in order to protect privacy it turned out much more was redacted than names the report was riddled with blackedout sections and missing information  pages in the report were entirely blacked out  pages were mostly blacked out  pages were partially blacked out some of the blackedout pages just included a heading marked evidence some just had a date witness statements an astonishing  witness accounts are missing from the police report the police report stated there were seventytwo  witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio andor video recordings copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the usao for review copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the technical support unit tsu located at the iad of those  witness statements only  were in the materials provided to wnd leaving  missing statement transcripts none of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided just paraphrased versions in what the former nypd officer sanders described as cop talk white house guard post video stills were released but not the video it would show whether anyone was manning the post when carey drove up whether she tried to drive around the offduty guard who dragged a gate in front of her and whether she sped off or left at a normal speed as a witness said police radio recordings no recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of carey were provided in the foia material also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters ballistics and forensics reports the justice department washington metro police department responses to foia requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report 
i could go on and on for people who want facts and reports the us justice department under both holder and lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press 
weve been at this for a long time  years yet the stonewall and coverup of a horrendous unjustifiable outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues 
do we really expect eric holder and loretta lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that

benghazi consulate attackers used militarystyle tactics say us officials  
experts still unsure whether assault that killed  americans in libya could have been prevented  
by matt apuzzo and kimberly dozier   
september    am  washington ap  the heavily armed extremists who laid siege to the us consulate in libya used militarystyle tactics that may have steered americans toward a waiting ambush us officials said friday as they pieced together details about how the compound was overrun 

us intelligence indicates that  or more people many of them masked were responsible for the sept  assault on the us diplomatic mission in benghazi gun trucks provided added firepower the attackers set up a perimeter controlling access in and out of the compound a first wave of attacks sent the americans fleeing to a fallback building where a second group of extremists beset them with precise mortar fire 

intelligence reports were still coming in but officials told the associated press that what may have initially seemed like a protest over an antiislam movie that had spun out of control now showed the hallmarks of a more sophisticated operation 

in a country coming off a civil war a level of battlefield savvy does not prove the attack on the compound was planned well in advance how much planning went into the operation and whether it could have been detected or prevented remain unanswered questions officials said 

the attacks killed ambassador chris stevens diplomat sean smith and two former navy seals who us officials said were security officers guarding diplomatic officials stevens was visiting benghazi from tripoli to preside over the opening of an american space cultural center 

the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss intelligence reports they stressed that even now authorities do not have a clear understanding of exactly what happened in benghazi fbi agents from new york and washington were in libya investigating the attack 

what happened in benghazi was a terrorist attack secretary of state hillary clinton said friday and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four americans 

officials have not singled out one responsible group but have focused their attention on ansar alshariah a libyan militant group led by a former detainee at the us militaryrun prison in guantanamo bay cuba 

since the civil war that ousted libyan dictator moammar gadhafi last year the country has been awash with rebels militias and terrorists weaponry is easy to come by both from the former regime from weapons depots looted during the war and from foreign powers that armed the rebellion the origin of the weapons used in the assault on the us compound was unclear officials said

an angry john podesta issues a statement on reopening of fbi probe   
by tyler durden   
oct    pm while hillary has yet to address todays stunning letter by fbi director comey who reported that the federal bureau of investigations has opened a probe into hillary clintons email as a result of findings on what the nyt reported was an electronic device belonging to anthony wiener a clearly angry john podesta clintons recently hacked campaign chair issued the following statement in response to fbi letter to gop congressional chairmen 

in response to the letter sent by fbi director james convey to eight republican committee chairman in congress hillary for america chair john podesta released the following statement friday 

upon completing this investigation more than three months ago fbi director comet declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call in the months since donald trump and his republican allies have been baselessly secondguessing the fbi and in both public and private browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm hillary clintons presidential campaign

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

Kimberly Reed Smith,no title,by shane wright  voter fraud is a contentious issue of late liberals swear it is a myth propagated by evil racist conservatives we know better most on the right are aware of the voter fraud issue but many have little to no idea how to combat or report violations consider this your crash course first and foremost step one in any instance where you see or suspect voter fraud is to alert the state officials who oversee the election process for most states this is done by the secretary of state in other states there is a state board of elections notifying these officials is paramount as they are the ones who ultimately certify and authenticate elections alert them before you call fox news or blow up twitter though drawing as much media attention as possible is beneficial you want to make sure you follow a process i have included a contact list for each state at the bottom of this post in many cases once you have alerted the state authorities they will direct you to the proper city or county officials where you will fill out paperwork bureaucracy at its finest go ahead and jump through their hoops if you witnessed the fraud chances are someone else did too make a good effort to get other witness names and contact information as well this will strengthen your case and increase the likelihood that state and county officials will step in and act on your complaint if as has happened before state officials ignore you entirely your next step is to contact your state attorney general and alert them of the situation however before you do this you need to arm yourself with knowledge of your specific states election laws you will be more credible if you are able to cite the specific statutes which were violated state laws are generally published online however it may actually be quicker and easier for you to go to your local library or courthouse and utilize their search engines in my experience relevant case law and updated statutes can be difficult to sort through on google or other internet search sites the attorney general should conduct an investigation to determine whether or not there is enough evidence andor information to take legal action if state officials refuse to work with you your next step is to alert both your state representative and state senator they may intercede and it is in the secretary of state and attorney generals best interest to respond professionally and quickly to these representatives should you continue to hit dead ends on the state level its time to alert the department of justice before doing this call your congressman and senator in some cases they will be willing to write a letter on your behalf to the doj this is what your goal is ultimately for the doj is less likely to ignore these officials if going through your elected officials is a poor option as it may very well be depending on the circumstances review federal election law and proceed anyways finally you and i both know that the doj nor liberal state officials are likely to do anything about a claim of election fraud however it is absolutely imperative that you go through these motions and document these steps to preserve any future legal options documenting instances of election fraud will continue to strengthen our case for voter id furthermore it is important to press forward on these criminals so that its understood that we will not idly stand by and allow our elections to be manipulated last but not least use your head if you see or suspect voter manipulation have the courage to record it whip out your phone and start shooting video  and report it to the appropriate authorities first alabama,westernjournalism.com,Real,english,98.4,82.22642928926737,8,2,3642,638,4.706896551724138,638.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,0.1754645812777864,0.2222254926337612,-0.3772191210869005,0.2390184566023011,0.0109717868338558,0.0,0.0094043887147335,0,0,0.0,0.0190198305408753,-0.9755,0.101,0.126,0.773,Negative,Very Strong

democratic vice president joe biden wants american women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy if we just put all the women back to work if they were able to afford childcare we would increase the gdp in america by close to eight tenths of one percent he said thats trillions of dollars over the next decade 
biden made his remarks during a campaign event for hillary clinton at chatham university in pittsburgh pennsylvania on tuesday the state of our economy could be characterized by a single word pitiful he argued were still battling recession i dont care what the official stats are saying america is still in recession and were not doing anything about it 
he added that it was lazy american women who brought about the downfall of the economy because they sit around on their behinds doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them im not sure how exactly we got to this point but were here and we need to move like yesterday he said 
mark my words and mark them well he addressed the crowd hillary clinton is the only one who can force american women to go to work this is true because of a number of reasons first shes a woman herself and not just any woman shes a selfmade woman so you better believe what shes saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times 
second hillary clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a freeloader when your husband is the breadwinner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house the children make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties shes been all that and shes learned how to break free from it the hard way i might add biden continued 
todays women are pampered and arent used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own the vice president said theyre too dependent too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy the reason for that is theyve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics when a soughtafter commodity becomes short in supply the demand for it rises even higher 
now thats all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests but if you look at the big picture its the economy thats missing out on valuable workforce and thats why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces and like i said hillary clinton is the only one who can do it which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next president of the united states we need to heal this country folks not run it into the ground even deeper biden concluded",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,69,12,2682,497,4.382293762575452,497.0,0.2152723163182744,0.3616742515005802,-0.0785242214597929,0.0011825012347656,-0.6975702399695177,0.012807566773538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9561,0.094,0.071,0.835,Positive,Very Strong

Brock Robinson,reasons you should stop using facebook,"why is obama threatening russia with world war  right before the election michael on television we are being set up for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash   november th  
since donald trumps victory on election night we have seen the worst bond crash in  years  global bond investors have seen trillions of dollars of wealth wiped out since november th and analysts are warning of another tough week ahead the general consensus in the investing community is that a trump administration will mean much higher inflation and as a result investors are already starting to demand higher interest rates unfortunately for all of us history has shown that higher interest rates always cause an economic slowdown and this makes perfect sense because economic activity naturally slows down when it becomes more expensive to borrow money the obama administration had already set up the next president for a major recession anyway but now this bond crash threatens to bring it on sooner rather than later 
for those that are not familiar with the bond market when yields go up bond prices go down and when bond prices go down that is bad news for economic growth 
so we generally dont want yields to go up 
unfortunately yields have been absolutely soaring over the past couple of weeks and the yield on  year treasury notes has now jumped one full percentage point since july  
the year treasury yield jumped to  in late trading on friday the highest since december  up  basis point since the election and up one full percentage point since july 
the year yield is at a critical juncture in terms of reality the first thing that might happen is a rate increase by the fed in december after a year of flipflopping a slew of postelection pronouncements by fed heads  including yellens relatively soon  have pushed the odds of a rate hike to  
as i noted the other day  so many things in our financial system are tied to yields on us treasury notes just look at what is happening to mortgages as wolf richter has noted  the average rate on  year mortgages is shooting into the stratosphere 
the carnage in bonds has consequences the average interest rate of the a conforming year fixed mortgage as of friday was quoted at  for top credit scores thats up about  percentage point from just before the election according to mortgage news daily  it put the month on a short list of  worst months in more than a decade 
if mortgage rates continue to shoot higher there will be another housing crash 
rates on auto loans credit cards and student loans will also be affected throughout our economic system it will become much more costly to borrow money and that will inevitably slow the overall economy down 
why bond investors are so on edge these days is because of statements such as this one from steve bannon  
in a nascent administration that seems at best random in its beliefs bannon can seem to be not just a focused voice but almost a messianic one 
like andrew jacksons populism were going to build an entirely new political movement he says its everything related to jobs the conservatives are going to go crazy im the guy pushing a trilliondollar infrastructure plan with negative interest rates throughout the world its the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything ship yards iron works get them all jacked up were just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks it will be as exciting as the s greater than the reagan revolution  conservatives plus populists in an economic nationalist movement 
steve bannon is going to be one of the most influential voices in the new trump administration and he is absolutely determined to get this trillion dollar infrastructure plan through congress 
and that is going to mean a lot more borrowing and a lot more spending for a government that is already on pace to add  trillion dollars to the national debt this fiscal year 
sadly all of this comes at a time when the us economy is already starting to show significant signs of slowing down it is being projected that we will see a sixth straight decline in yearoveryear earnings for the sp  and industrial production has now contracted for  months in a row  
the truth is that the economy has been barely treading water for quite some time now and it isnt going to take much to push us over the edge the following comes from lance roberts  
with an economy running at below  consumers already heavily indebted wage growth weak for the bulk of americans there is not a lot of wiggle room for policy mistakes 
combine weak economics with higher interest rates which negatively impacts consumption and a stronger dollar which weighs on exports and you have a real potential of a recession occurring sooner rather than later 
yes the stock market soared immediately following trumps election but it wasnt because economic conditions actually improved 
if you look at history a stock market crash almost always follows a major bond crash so if bond prices keep declining rapidly that is going to be a very ominous sign for stock traders 
and history has also shown us that no bull market can survive a major recession if the economy suffers a major downturn early in the trump administration it is inevitable that stock prices will follow 
the waning days of the obama administration have set us up perfectly for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash 
of course any problems that occur after january th  will be blamed on trump but the truth is that obama will be far more responsible for what happens than trump will be 
right now so many people have been lulled into a sense of complacency because donald trump won the election 
that is an enormous mistake 
a shaking has already begun in the financial world and this shaking could easily become an avalanche 
now is not a time to party rather it is time to batten down the hatches and to prepare for very rough seas ahead 
all of the things that so many experts warned were coming may have been delayed slightly but without a doubt they are still on the way

the leaders have expressed hope that the switzerland meeting will pave the way for the last phase of talks in line with their shared commitment to do their utmost in order to reach a settlement within  the un spokesman said 
negotiations on reuniting the mediterranean island under a single federal roof have made significant headway since anastasiades and akinci resumed talks led by the un nearly  months ago

Louis Stuart,how we can win the propaganda war,"home  be the change  nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails fbi can access them any time nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails fbi can access them any time jay syrmopoulos august    comments 
washington dc  one of the architects of the national security agencys surveillance programs dropped a bombshell over the weekend when he stated that the nsa has all of hillary clintons deleted emails he also noted that the fbi has the technical and legal ability to gain access to them if they chose to do so 
william binney is a former highly respected nsa official that served the agency for over  years helping to create its surveillance program  before becoming a famed whistleblower upon resigning in  on sunday he declared in a radio interview broadcast that the hack of the dnc could have been coordinated by someone inside the us intelligence community angry over clintons compromise of national security data with her email use 
appearing on sunday on aaron klein investigative radio and speaking as an intelligence analyst binney questioned whether the hack of the democratic national committees servers were actually the work of russian hackers as the clinton camp has alleged instead he raised the possibility that it was actually the work of disgruntled us intelligence officials upset about clinton being given a pass on criminal charges after compromising national security secrets through her use of unsecure personal email servers that were undoubtedly accessed by numerous foreign intelligence services 
during his interview with reporter aaron klein binney referenced thenfbi director robert s muellers testimony in march  before the senate judiciary committee in which mueller spoke of the fbis ability to access a number of secretive databases to track down known and suspected terrorists 
now what he mueller is talking about is going into the nsa database which is shown of course in the edward snowden material released which shows a direct access into the nsa database by the fbi and the cia which there is no oversight of by the way so that means that nsa and a number of agencies in the us government also have those emails binney said so if the fbi really wanted them they can go into that database and get them right now binney stated in regards to the missing clinton emails 
when klein asked whether he believed the nsa has copies of all of clintons emails including the deleted correspondence binney replied with a oneword bombshell yes  he responded that would be my point they have them all and the fbi can get them right there 
according to a report by breitbart  
and the other point is that hillary according to an article published by the observer in march of this year has a problem with nsa because she compromised gamma material now that is the most sensitive material at nsa and so there were a number of nsa officials complaining to the press or to the people who wrote the article that she did that she lifted the material that was in her emails directly out of gamma reporting that is a direct compromise of the most sensitive material at the nsa so shes got a real problem there so there are many people who have problems with what she has done in the past so i dont necessarily look at the russians as the only ones who got into those emails 
the observer defined the gamma classification 
gamma compartment which is an nsa handling caveat that is applied to extraordinarily sensitive information for instance decrypted conversations between top foreign leadership as this was 
how interesting to think about the distinct possibility that the hacked and leaked emails are not the result of russian hackers but actually came to wikileaks from an unknown crusader at the nsa itself  another snowden if you will 
let us hope that after for years of watching clinton expose national security secrets through reckless handling of highly classified intelligence some determined patriots within the intelligence community are now working to see the downfall of clintons by exposing their corrupt political apparatus likely we will never know as zero hedge reported  it is the nsa that has been tasked with determining if the russian government is behind the hacks one thing we already know is that when an agency investigates itself it never finds itself responsible share",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,82.22642928926737,33,7,4341,727,4.936726272352132,727.0,-0.8854291000327017,-0.5778293249656962,0.3604001782710864,0.3617490829494393,-0.1503997263775946,0.381804053728258,0.0027510316368638,0.0,0.0,0,2,0.0,0.0068142135125147,0.9388,0.073,0.051,0.877,Positive,Very Strong

shortly after hillary clintons crushing defeat the media came up with another spin zuckerberg and facebook were held responsible for her debacle what crap facebook apparently carried fake news didnt the media invent and promote precisely this kind of news to bounce hillary over the last hurdle its convenient for media whores to blame everybody except themselves and hillarys corrupt campaign organization for her defeat clinton labeled ordinary americans deplorables displaying her contempt for half of the population hillary clinton was favorite puppet of the establishment she was the embodiment of a hopelessly corrupt political system and the american people realized it despite massive attempts by media presstitutes to sell her image an estimated  per cent of media outlets beat the drums for her and for her husbands corrupt clinton foundation
the real reason behind the attempt to blame zuckerbergs facebook is that it makes everyone and no one responsible what is posted on facebook can no longer be controlled by the media and the political class they lost control of public opinion established methods of mindcontrol do not work any longer the fawning media report only what they are fed by government spindoctors it is more comfortable for them to act like the mouthpieces of their masters this holds true for us media as well of the media class in the european vassal states german media were for example as manipulative as those in the united states they celebrated president obama as the embodiment of good america ignoring that he waged wars during his entire presidency incarcerated several whistleblowers and signed off extralegal executions but he possessed a great advantage he was black or if you wish nonwhite obama was thus a nonwhite and smarter version of george w bush
when mark zuckerberg visited berlin in february  he was bootlicked by the german political and media class the springer group the most outspoken mouthpiece of us interests us in germany awarded him the axel springer award of greater political relevance was the dinner meeting between zuckerberg and chancellor angela merkel who tried to convince him to apply himself with more determination against socalled hatespeech on the internet the merkel regime considers that freedom of speech hurts her policy merkels minister of justice heiko maas has established some sort of a private internet police that hunts the web for hate speech whatever that means
there is no agreed upon definition what hate speech implies hence the meaning can be volatile or arbitrarily the range of hate speech can range from antimuslim rhetoric via personal insults and threats to a call to kill every jewish zionist there is a duty of government under the international convention for the abolition of all forms of racial discrimination to prohibit the dissemination of racial propaganda ergo there exists a legal and ethical basis for prohibiting certain forms of hate speech
even restrictions to free speech extend to other spheres such as prohibition of deceitful advertising slandering other people and in some countries advertising tobacco and alcohol is forbidden in iceland human rights law accepts the right of governments to restrict freedom of speech in order to protect other social values there is a great deal of jurisprudence regarding the question who to weigh this right against other rights
in germany this body of private detectives includes civil society groups such as klicksafede jugendschutznet gesicht zeigen show your face to name a few the most eminent of these is the amadeu antonio foundation run by a former stasi agent by the name of anetta kahane who claims to fight racism antisemitism and xenophobia today she and her organization are at the forefront of criticizing people who dare to criticize the excesses of merkels policy of government failure
internet giants such as facebook google and youtube and twitter also participated voluntarily in this constitutive meeting in which this kind of internet watchdog was set up in september  this new censorship body was established in the german ministry of justice and works since then without legal basis the participants agreed on best practices in handling hate messages there are no publically known criteria according to which one can recognize hate speach that means that this censorship body makes it decisions arbitrarily there are no rules or statutory provisions those whose messages are blocked have thus no legal recourse against such censorship despite such arbitrary practice the interim results which were presented in the ministry of justice on  september  were not satisfactory google and youtube and facebook representatives participated in the presentation of the results from august to september  punishable contents were reported that were deleted by the companies nevertheless the ministry of justice was not satisfied
thus it is not only the american political class which is blaming facebook for the defeat of its minion hillary clinton but also the german political class and its compliant media that intend to crack down on facebook fearing that ordinary people could endanger merkels quest for a renewed mandate as chancellor but what appears more important is their desperate attempt to control public opinion because the deplorables ie the mass of ordinary people do not anymore wish to be bamboozled by half a dozen editorsinchief the attempt to free themselves from such control has to be crushed with the help of facebook and google
at the beginning zuckerberg rejected the ridiculous accusations of being responsible for clintons defeat after a while it appears that he has accepted to do the dirty work for the censors and caved in on friday november   zuckerberg wrote on facebook that the amount of misinformation is relatively small nonetheless there is much work ahead on our roadmap the following work in progress was outlined by him
a stronger detection system the most important thing we can do is to improve our ability to classify misinformation this means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves
 easy reporting making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster
 third party verification there are many respected fact checking organizations and while we have reached out to some we plan to learn from many more
 warnings we are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community and showing warnings when people read or share them
 related articles quality we are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in news feed
 disrupting fake news economics a lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam were looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week and better ad farm detection
 listening we will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input in particular to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them
apparently zuckerberg understands the importance of the issue i beg to differ the issue is not about fake news it is about universal freedom of speech that poses a threat to the mindcontrol industry owned by a few families on both sides of the atlantic ocean if they lose this control of public opinion they rightly fear to lose in the long run their privileges
dear mr zuckerberg take courage and do not interfere with ordinary folks speaking their minds despite the pressure and intimidation by the political and media class
when one discusses freedom of expression and the role of facebook one point needs special scrutiny namely the private character of this entity the private character of an entity precludes transparency citizens and users do not possess any rights to inspect the finances let alone participate in determining facebook projects and policies as a citizen one cannot accept that one unelected person however nice he may be could determine the projects and policies of an entity that is now serving billions of human beings such a structure just cries for corruption and arbitrary rule one can see this operating within wikipedia where doctrinaires exert control over subjects of social science such as the circumstances of  or the israelpalestinian conflict its impossible to even insert critical question because they dont pass the censorship of certain guardians of mind control google is another such leviathan that cries for public and transparent ownership how such public ownership of a global corporation is to be accomplished is a question that begs for an answer the first step would certainly be for civil society without influence from the corporate world to get together and consider a more democratic and transparent structure for such global services it would be wise for civil society to get going before corporations will establish fake democratic forums to preempt this goal",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,5.169608718030007,81,12,9065,1464,5.17827868852459,1464.0,0.5821727884352664,0.3616742515005802,1.6102367450755914,1.5171298252264591,0.0879888191817028,1.5641971445353389,0.0013661202185792,0.0,0.0006830601092896,0,1,0.0,0.0029014543608014,0.9017,0.148,0.141,0.711,Positive,Very Strong
Caleb Stephen,how to survive a nuclear fallout,"keywords medical equipment  stethoscope facts  stethoscopes history 
when we hear the word doctor the first image comes in our mind is a person in a white coat with a stethoscope hanging around his neck the stethoscope has become a very common name amongst people thanks to its display in various tv shows movies and frequent use of it by doctors but still there are many fun facts which other people might not know about stethoscope so here they are  
 years old history  yes stethoscopes are one of the oldest inventions which are still being used across the world by millions of doctors rene laennec in  had invented the stethoscope it was a wooden instrument and looked quite different from what we see it as now 
i see your chest  stethoscope is a greek word which roughly translates into i see the chest stethos means chest and scope mean examination 
an interesting story behind its invention  when stethoscope was not invented doctors would put their ears around the chest of patients and gently tap the chest with fingers this technique would make female patients little uncomfortable rene laennec was a very shy person once he was examining an overweight woman he found it difficult to hear her hear sounds to hear heartbeats of that lady he rolled a quire paper into a tube and placed it on her chest this inspired him to make the device which we all are familiar with and called stethoscope 
google doodle for rene laennec  on february th  rene laennec would have celebrated his th birthday to commemorate this day google doodle marked his th birthday 
used to identify if a person is dead or not 
nowadays stethoscope is used to hear heart sounds and to determine symbols of other diseases but initially stethoscope was designed to find out if the person in the hospital is dead or alive 
it might be replaced very soon 
as mentioned stethoscopes were invented almost  years ago and being in use for such a long time shows that how useful and efficient stethoscopes are however as the technology is getting advanced every passing day stethoscopes might be replaced very soon by pocketsized ultrasonic devices which can perform multiple measurements on patients

admin,meet peter kadzik  another clinton stooge at the justice department,"last week i expounded the idea that we should take the time to ponder about emotions  these matter much in prompting us to take action or not to to think about something or not to sustained emotional states can lead us to pedestalize girls ignore our own needs or refraining from caring about our own interests whereas others push theirs every day they can also allow said girls to go shamelessly after shortterm pleasure or be complacent to rapefugees while shrieking and fingerwaving against men of their own kin
pondering passions and emotions does not mean getting led by them at the expense of critical thinking rather it is the exact opposite as it allows us to spot the shrewd ones who want to push our emotional buttons as well as being freer to take more thoughtful and actually less emotiondetermined actions once we have gained awareness of passions we can decide which ones we want to stimulate and why
following this idea i made some suggestions of how and in whom we could stir positive emotions such empathy hope and love today i will do the same with four other passions or emotions admiration shame humility and fear
 admiration 
society i think should admit some victimhood to those who were raised as weaklings or acted cluelessly out of good intentions women in particular should be more empathetic and nurturing towards nice and beta malesas long as their empathy does not extent out of admitted boundarieshence taking an opposite direction from the egotistical uncaring orientation a lot of them currently harbor of course this should not equate to validating too much the unhealthy unmanly men women should also be trained into validating more manlier men and here admiration comes into play
as nassim taleb put it we are living more and more in an extremistan where those at the highest level take the lions share while the resources diminish quickly down the ladder girls today tend to admire only the most famous or highstatus people which leads them to despise the ninetynine per cent this exasperated hypergamy should be tamed so that the average man as long as he achieves the minimum andor is upstanding and dutiful gets his fair share a more democratic but still conditional distribution of girls admiration would reward actual good behaviour for men and decrease the intramasculine competition 
girls should also admireand not mockproper feminine role models upstanding mothers females taking proper care of themselves and so on ought to be at least esteemed by the average girl
 shame 
shame arises from measuring our actions against moral standards and discovering that they fall short if our actions fall short and we fail to notice we can be shamed or made to notice shame is normally accentuated if its object is exposed but unlike embarrassment also attaches to a thought or action that remains undisclosed and undiscoverable to others neel burton heaven and hell  chap p
a particularly strong emotion shame usually comes as a blow makes one lose face or composure to eventually feel guilt or remorse just like other strong emotions it has been used with consumed malignancy by the left
leftists created a narrative where whites are held entirely responsible for dreadful historical phenomena such as slavery the holocaust an oppression of minority groups or racism as these phenomena are constantly talked about and expanded whites are also supposed to feel a correspondingly boundless guilt the sheer power of guilt can explain why so many whites have been afraid to stand up being shamed as a racist or nazi can be enough to endure rejection from ones family lose reputation and employment
shame can be aroused through two levers the standards one agrees with and ones purported responsibility both levers have been skillfully used to un shame the liberalfavored groups as for the standards feminists attacked what they called slutshaming while also shaming relentlessly manly behavior and as for the responsibility pretty much all those who claim to identify with a minority tend to deny all by slipping it over the majoritys shoulders
this is how you get persistent offenders or jihadi families expressing neither shame nor remorse whereas the productive working and normally sociable person gets nagged for being white in the current year better be a true rapist who can evade responsibility and shame by invading europe than a young virgin of european descent
what we should do here sounds pretty obvious in theory though it will be much harder to carry on in practice as people evidently hate being shamed especially when they have been accustomed of blaming everything on the others
shame the fatties  shame the arrogant snowflakes whose unwillingness to respect is all too obvious recall the selfdetermination of antiwhite liberals and criminals they all made free choices they should carry all associated responsibility
as for us we must keep our face straight never make clueless concessions to skillful framers or hysterical sjws if they appeal to moral standards put forth your own as legitimate if they appeal to your purported actions or responsibility emphasize theirsand how it cannot be boiled down to external factors
even dogs and cats are considered responsible by their caretakers so they can be punished for bad behaviours and learn likewise granting certain people or groups a constant deresponsabilization amounts to give them a free pass for destroying everything criminals of said groups have agency and the liberals who gave them a pass to plunder and kill whitey are responsible as well
shame can also arise from being associated with something or someone deemed as despicable the liberal policy of distinguishing sharply between terrorists and documented aliens in spite of how much the latter to house the former allows for the latter going without shame even when they are closely associated with terroristswhereas every white is threatened with shame if he has a ist or phobic acquaintance
turn the table shake off the burden from the disenfranchised majority and put it back on those who have been acting with impunity for too long
 humility 
current year girls overinflated ego is enough notwithstanding economic or racial factors to explain a host of social problems blinded by it girls ignore how much they are determined by their own cravings shortterm desires or by the latest fashions around they drink loads of booze fuck with random strangers reframe their story as a rape later so they can blame it all on the guy  they never learn to cook clean take care of something else than their instagram account and corporate career speaking of corporate isnt it striking that so many men are badly in need of employment sex and have almost nothing whereas spoiled corporate drones believe they can havetakeit all
ego makes one lose any sense of proportion or balance it leads to complacency merciless exploitation of others refusal to take responsibility and open despise
augustine of hippo wrote that humility was at the foundation of all other virtues this makes sense if ones ego is inflated one does not feel the need to practice virtues and feels entitled to never be ashamed of her shortcomingsthat are easily denied or blamed on someone else ego also leads to wasting resources on luxury parce que je le vaux bien  as says a famous brand of cosmetics instead of focusing on selfimprovement or caretaking
though girls should be the first to have their ego smashed as the survival of basic family units depends on it bloated ego is a general disease in our age men too can be sold the idea that say being a smug urban elf is a proof that one sides with progress and civilization whereas they are actually weak dependent and unable to fix anything by themselves its not all about our individual selves
 fear 
readers asked for it so here it is fear is a very powerful emotion to the point of prompting one to freeze flee abandon a previously planned course of action or never even think to consider an idea or an action the left has been using it in two different albeit complementary ways
first it has constantly accused conservatives to play on fears implying irrational or unjustified fears when they dared to ask serious questions or making realistic assessment when the  immigration act was voted democrat senators pretended that opening up the borders would not change the ethnic mix of america and that any suspicion it might happen was highly emotional in france the socialists and mainstream righters alike have been carrying the same accusations here the left accused any doubt to be a hint of unjustified and intolerable fear
well what happened since doesnt it look like every fear from the right was justifiedespecially since the postww right has always been incredibly wary not to say coward when it came to criticize the lefts moral high ground
second the left has also been keen on doing exactly what it accused the conservatives to do namely stirring fear about political bogeymen liberals invented rape culture or patriarchal oppression when men actually became weaker they associated to nazism any white person who assumes his race should basically survive they shamelessly bludgeoned whom they could call white supremacists as if defending ones right to live in peace against hordes of thugs and violent parasites was equal to being hitler himself
whites were led to fear their own supposed authoritarian tendencies as the shrewd jews who intrigued through the frankfurt school put it see kevin macdonald culture of critique  chap whites were led to fear some of their fearsbetter have ones daughter killed by muslims than expressing concerns about them to other whites because racism is so evil boo
when i was younger i noticed the local thugs had a huge advantage over us normal people they were much more fearless they had this devilmaycare provocative attitude which made them potentially dangerous to the bourgeois prude beta male and attractive to females not incidentally the first movie of the french essayist alain soral confessions dun dragueur confessions of a womanizer shows a young arab with decent pickup experience taking a young middleclass white boy under his wing as to help him escape from virginity
feeling fear is a necessary step in life fear appears greatly useful when there is something to flee from or watch as a potential hazard but being too fearful or afraid of the wrong things can be a serious liability never trust a liberal who either points finger at you for being fearful or tries to paint you as dangerous and justifying his own fearmongering
on the flip side being feared by others is not always a negative some people need to be afraid to respect you if you try to treat them correctly or let free rein to your innate generosity they will harm and exploit you such people just as everyone around who may be tempted to disrespect should be kept in check by a minimal fear better be feared and respected than getting tread upon
conclusion frame and un frame whatever matters when you have to as you have to the left cursed us by locking us into an always negative framing when we fail whatever the reason we are despised as weak or losers and when we succeed they say we are privileged and oppressive in both cases the chosen framing leads to negative emotions associated to us no matter what we actually do 
fortunately it is always possible to turn the tables provided we keep a tight frame and change these emotions as well for example when we are weak we should elicit empathy be noticed for our good intentions or noble infirmities and when we are strong we should elicit admiration and trust
think frame feel positive about us and about what we do get rid of those who wont

nato secretary general jens stoltenberg has downplayed suggestions that eu military buildup might undermine the western alliance as the bid to establish an independent european army appears to gain momentum 
i strongly believe it is absolutely possible to strengthen european defense without duplicating efforts by nato stoltenberg said on thursday adding eu leaders have also conveyed that this is not about the eu doing collective defense the eu building structures that would compete with nato 
stoltenberg made the remarks following a meeting between european unions foreign policy chief federica mogherini and nato defense ministers in brussels 
mogherini one of the strongest supporters of a joint european defense force has drawn up a global strategy for the bloc which says the nation bloc should seek strategic autonomy to face multiple security threats ranging from conventional to hybrid warfare from the ukraine crisis to syria from poverty in africa to massive refugee flows 
the proposal has sparked concerns that the bloc is seeking a more independent role 
mogherini on thursday said the bloc does have civilian and military operations such as in africa or in the mediterranean and needs to improve command and control centers to run them 
she however attempted to downplay concerns that the formation of an eu force could lead to the duplication of nato functions saying but this can be done  without any kind of overlapping or duplication with nato nato secretary general jens stoltenberg r chairs a nato defense ministers meeting flanked by eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini nd l and nato deputy secretary general rose gottemoeller nd r at the nato headquarters in brussels on october   photo by afp 
in july an eu strategy document said that the bloc should look to create greater military autonomy from nato it stated the eu could no longer rely on the alliance regarding various security issues and must instead develop an ability to act autonomously if and when necessary 
european commission president jeanclaude juncker was the first to call for the establishment of an eu army in march  
a joint eu army would show the world that there would never again be a war between eu countries he said 
his suggestion however received a cool response from nato loading",presstv.ir,Real,english,99.2,47.88118811881188,43,6,2442,393,5.173027989821883,393.0,-0.579678706601875,-0.7657300402589515,-0.1420214221441877,-0.1618563009318694,0.082806894501576,-0.1540430186320744,0.005089058524173,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0101451477414571,0.9655,0.096,0.031,0.874,Positive,Very Strong

an intriguing ministry of finance mof report circulating in the kremlin today says that elite western bankers were stunned a few hours ago after the bank for international settlements bis registered a  billion transfer from the clinton foundation cf to the qatar central bank qcb through the facilitationabetment of jp morgan chase  company jpmand for reasons yet to be firmly established 
according to this report the bank for international settlements is the worlds oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions the qatar central bank is the bank of that gulf state nations government and their bank of banks jp morgan chase  company is the united states largest megabank and the clinton foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the russian mafia 
with hillary clintons us presidential campaign chairman john podesta having longstanding ties to the russian mafia and money laundering this report continues the foreign intelligence service svr maintains complete surveillance of him and his criminal associatesincluding both hillary clinton and her husband and former us president bill clinton 
on saturday  october  this report notes the svr reported to the mof that hillary clinton and john podesta met with jp morgan chase  company ceo jamie dimon at clintons chappaqua compound outside of new york cityand who in  both president obama and hillary clinton allowed to break us laws by his dimons being able to buy millionsofdollars of his companys stocks prior to the public being told his jp morgan bank was receiving a federal reserve  billion credit lineand that caused jp morgans stocks to soar and that have had an astonishing  dividend growth since  
within  hours of the hillary clintonjohn podestajamie dimon meeting at the chappaqua compound this report continues the bis registered the transfer of  billion from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank 
to why the clinton foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to qatar this report explains is due to the longstanding ties between this islamic neopatrimonial absolute monarchy and then us secretary of state hillary clinton who oversaw the massive bribery scheme that allowed this gulf state nation to secure the  world cupand that the qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the clinton foundation and incredibly in  gave former us president bill clinton  million for a birthday presentbringing hillary clintons total cash grab from these persian gulf sheiks of  millionall occurring as recently released secret emails revealed hillary clintons knowledge that both qatar and saudi arabia were and still are funding isis 
to what jamie dimon said to hillary clinton that caused her to suddenly transfer  billion to qatar this report notes revolves around his jp morgan bank being told by the us federal deposit insurance corporation fdic in april  that this megabanks master plan to save itself had serious deficiencies that could pose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the united states 
two months after the fdics warning letter to jamie dimon in june  this report says he cryptically sounded a warning that the united states subprime auto loan bubble was nearing collapse and stated that someone is going to get hurt 
unbeknownst to the american people mof experts in this report explain is that just  weeks ago multiple warnings began to be issued that the united states  trillion subprime auto loan bubble was beginning to collapseand that this past week became so severe the bank of america issued a recession warning telling its elite customers that this market is scary and the britishbased multinational banking and financial services company hsbc likewise issued a red alert warning all of its clients warning them to prepare for a severe market crash 
with one of the first casualties of this subprime auto loan bubble being the german global banking giant deutsche bank that is nearing its doom and laying off tensofthousands of it workers worldwide this report grimly states the american mainstream propaganda media is failing to allow the people of that nation to know the full extent of this looming catastrophewho unlike hillary clinton who has just protected  billion of her wealth will be left defenseless once again at the hands of their elite rulers 
as wikileaks secret hillary clinton emails have now proven that the us propaganda mainstream media is now totally controlled by her and who continue their blackout on the clinton crime story of the century this report continues the absolutely horrifying statistics released this week showing that an astounding  of american who have been brutalized by the obamaclinton regime these past  years are so buried in debt they can no longer pay their bills is likewise being kept from these most innocent of peoples",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,71,13,4940,784,5.2563775510204085,784.0,0.2764223950044397,0.5495749667938356,0.5188786083125552,0.4511068879830759,0.1650647372587192,0.4732510091909495,0.0127551020408163,0.0,0.0076530612244897,0,0,0.0,0.0213708443501715,-0.9747,0.065,0.097,0.838,Negative,Very Strong

the ad is set to the carole king classic natural woman as sung by her daughter the ad features clips of ordinary women living their lives mixed with clips of elinor roosevelt rosa parks sally ride and hillary clinton twothirds of the way through the ad trump appears and audio of him calling women fat pigs slobs fat asses and flat chested among other insults on the screen are shots of women holding up up cards with the hashtag vote 
the message is clear powerful and absolutely devastating 
women need to vote against the behavior of donald trump the words of donald trump and his treatment of women must be rejected it is time for all americans of conscience to lead the way but if we are realistic about us society it will be women who lead the way women will provide the moral voice that rejects trump according to the polling it will be women who lead the way for hillary clinton to win the presidential

food waste and hunger are enormous global environmental and public health problems as overwhelming as these issues are community groups volunteers local businesses and organizations are working on trying to find a solution 
what started as a social action project in  a few members of a small community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste 
and theyre succeeding 
the project grew into a nonprofit organization with a team of more than  volunteer drivers a network of more than  donors and frontline agencies who feed the hungry on a daily basis 
amazingly the entire group has rescued more than  million pounds of food  enough to provide  million meals heres more of this motivating againstallodds story food waste and hunger 
about a third of the planets food goes to waste thats enough to feed two billion people 
the united nations environment programme unep and the world resources institute wri report that about onethird of all food produced worldwide  worth around  trillion  are lost or wasted in food production and consumption systems 
furthermore the natural resources defense council nrdc cites the following 
forty percent of the food in the united states is never eaten but at the same time one in eight americans struggles to put enough food on the table 
nearly  million people worldwide suffer from hunger  but according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations we squander enough food  globally  trillion pounds a year  to feed every one of them more than twice over 
in developing nations much of the food is lost after harvest because of the lack of refrigeration good roads and adequate storage facilities on the other hand developed nations waste more food when retailers order display or serve too much 
additionally consumers waste food when they ignore leftovers in the back of their refrigerators  or toss perishable food out before it expires more alarming statistics of wasted food 
much of the wasted food in the us ends up in landfills the us environmental protection agency epa reports that food waste is the second largest category of municipal solid waste sent to landfills in the united states 
and it accounts for about  percent of the waste stream thats more than  million tons of food waste that the us sends to the landfills each year 
additionally according to nrdc on average people dining out leave  percent of meals uneaten and  percent of these potential leftovers are not taken home 
in spite of the dismal statistics on food waste  and the struggles and pain hungry people endure  community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers in metroatlanta georgia are making headway in not wasting food and feeding people in need people are fed perishable food not wasted 
more than ten years ago a few members of a community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste they wanted to take leftover fresh food from grocery stores and restaurants and quickly deliver it to agencies that provide food to families and individuals in need 
since the first delivery was made in  the group has rescued more than  million pounds of food and the group believes this figure equals enough to provide more than  million meals 
as success mounted in eliminating food waste and feeding people in their community the group established itself as a nonprofit organization called second helpings atlanta  now second helpings atlanta has  donors  partner agencies and a team of more than  volunteer drivers who pick up and drop off perishable food every day 
executive director joe labriola says the challenge is getting the food from those who have it to those who need it and thats what we do we play a very specific role we do  scheduled pickups and deliveries a week weve gotten pretty good at this fresh food versus nonperishable 
fresh food provides more nutrition than the nonperishable processed diet that so many people eat  especially people with low or no income one of second helpings atlantas goals is to change that standard offering fresh food that will ideally help prompt healthier eating habits 
this year the group has delivered  pounds of food and labriola estimates they will pick up and deliver more than  million pounds by the end of the year 
the reason were so focused on perishable food is that were providing nutrition to the diets of people who are surviving on processed food were breaking the cycle and hope that some of the health benefits of fresh food will start to kick in 
according to labriola he sees no reason why this type of food waste program cant easily be adopted anywhere he adds that  percent of the food produced in the us is never consumed and the average annual cost per household of food that is thrown out is  
twenty percent of people in georgia live in a foodinsecure environment  meaning theyre not sure when theyre going to eat next its a pretty grim story labriola says but if we rescue just  percent of that food we can feed  million americans how its working 
when people sign up to volunteer theyre shown the available routes then theyre asked to choose the route that would work best with their location and schedule 
most pickups are regularly scheduled however the group often gets calls from people holding weddings bar mitzvahs or festivals  knowing there will be leftover food at the end of the night then a call goes out to find a volunteer to help pickup and delivery the leftover food 
volunteer drivers make food deliveries every day of the year except christmas food pickups range in size  so people can pick them up no matter if they own a small sedan or a minivan that way volunteering is within the reach of everyone 
from the time a driver leaves home  stopping to pick up the food and drop it off at a partner agency  it usually takes no longer than  minutes for he or she to return home families volunteer 
quite often entire families will volunteer and work together for the weekly delivery service labriola says families volunteering are instrumental to educating younger generations about hunger and food waste 
for example around thanksgiving a family with two young children met labriola one day to pick up dozens of turkeys at a grocery store the children looked amazed as they helped carry the delivery  birdbybird  from the store to the truck and into the agency that would distribute them to families labriola told the kids they just helped feed  families the children soon realized what they did one of the children said thats as many kids that are in my school 
the exemplary work and dedication exhibited by volunteers in the metroatlanta georgia community is a truly successful model of how to eliminate food waste and hunger perhaps more community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers will consider following their worthy example you might also like",legorafi.fr,Fake,english,16.684927674847486,47.88118811881188,34,5,7113,1189,4.906644238856182,1189.0,-0.854854060689619,-0.9536307555522068,1.0937928461758468,1.0860176079589146,-0.1800877432734625,1.123005692741652,0.0008410428931875,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0020832351655164,-0.8659,0.107,0.115,0.779,Negative,Very Strong

a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law 
alabamas judges are elected and accountable wrote justice tom parker this week federal judges as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v hodges  a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to samesex marriage are unaccountable and unelected 
he pointed out that three of the four dissenting us supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were consequently unaccountable 
parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning history tradition the courts own rules or the rule of law but upon their empathetic feelings 
obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges he said 
he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriagebased case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case which created samesex marriage nationwide was announced 
moore who is challenging the punishment insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves they did with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments 
parker said active judges should have been included in the panel because retired judges too are unelected and unaccountable 
unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda instead of faithfully applying the rule of law parker warned obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided obergefell the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states 
dont miss phyllis schlaflys book now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family 
before obergefell  states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in  of those states the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the  state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts  of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the  courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable 
he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account citing the situation that developed in iowa 
the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa however although the judges are initially appointed they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires 
he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law in april  in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional 
the very next year three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa this was the first time since iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law 
mathew staver chairman of of liberty counsel which is representing moore said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case 
chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law he said 
the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every turn this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the  vote never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule  has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right 
supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart who has been acting as alabamas chief justice 
she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore 
the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization 
if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary they will no doubt take our complaint seriously as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore said tom ford a spokesman for the group 
the complaints the group said outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety failed to perform the duties of her office impartially failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary 
parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary 
daniel horowitz  senior editor at conservative review told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation 
it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues whether its the bureaucrats whether its the courts and as it relates to even religious liberty even property rights immigration our voting rights who gets to vote he said 
horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america 
how did we get here horowitz asked rhetorically and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges the legal profession and unelected bureaucrats that is social transformation without representation which as scalia warned is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution 
samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in  by the bare  majority made up of anthony kennedy ruth ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan john roberts clarence thomas samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it 
the majority found in the constitution a right to samesex marriage overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states 
it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the us supreme court majority 
for one two of the justices in the majority kagan and ginsburg were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality without their votes the case would have gone the other way 
they refused 
then there was the us supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier in the defense of marriage act case in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage 
and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people 
as wnd reported  ginsburg who voted in favor of samesex marriage has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements justice elena kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm 
critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest 
the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case but they refused to acknowledge the request the foundation explained that canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court  usc sec a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned 
rabbi jonathan cahn author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah  judgment movie has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage 
at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation 
washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained 
justices can you judge the ways of god there is another court and there is another judge where all men and all judges will give account he warned 
if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal he said 
see jonathans cahns message at washington man of prayer event at the capitol 
the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling samesex marriage an intrinsic evil 
and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court 
wnd also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of washington  lee boston college kansas state notre dame university of texas villanova vanderbilt hillsdale university of nebraska catholic university and regent university issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the supreme courts recent creation of samesex marriage as anticonstitutional and illegitimate 
it cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the united states said the statement from the american principles project  
we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case to recognize the authority of states to define marriage and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell",wnd.com,Real,english,97.12303591710229,90.07139083078093,31,6,12226,1975,5.152911392405064,1975.0,-0.946579178718867,-0.7657300402589515,2.4465477924229755,2.318214708949061,0.0629537856989972,2.384011078595608,0.0015189873417721,0.0,0.0015189873417721,0,0,0.0,0.0026897659327809,0.998,0.134,0.095,0.771,Positive,Very Strong

EdJenner,the  biggest losers in donald trumps stunning victory,"the media lost all of its political power last night  thank you donald trump by john nolte november   
the morally dark obamaera is over and utterly and totally repudiated the clintons have finally and forever been staked in their mercenary black hearts our smug supremacist overlords in the elite establishment of both parties these rotting rentseeking parasites are now vanquished but nothing is grander nothing is more glorious nothing is more satisfying nothing is sweeter nothing is more validating nothing is better for america than the death of the mainstream medias political power 
the elite national political media is done as a force moral or otherwise in this country done buried exposed over out and using a slowacting poison called hubris it was death by suicide so smug so sure of themselves so sanctimonious so snarkfilled so utterly incapable of anything close to selfreflection 
the selfinduced poison took effect over a number of years and through five steps 
here they are 
 pimping for obamacare 
the national political media didnt just cheerlead for obamacare they lied to us willfully and with malicious intent they all lied to us the outlawing of almost every existing insurance plan was right there in the bill right there in black and white but the media didnt care they wanted to give their precious obama a win and in order to do that they jumped on board the you can keep your insurance propaganda express worse those of us who did tell the truth were branded as liars and racists not only by the pundits but by those godforsaken factcheckers 
then utopia met reality 
then the lies were exposed 
and the result is that up to and including last night at both the local and national level obamacare has decimated the democrat party but nowhere near as bad as it has decimated the middle class 
the medias role in this is unforgivable and destroyed whatever remained of their moral authority from here on they could only get more sweaty desperate and dangerous 
 casting off every journalistic ethic to destroy trump 
openly proudly and belligerently in order to hijack a presidential election we were treated to the pompous announcement that trump was such a threat to humanity it was now time for journalists throughout the land to cast off every standard that makes journalism journalism starting with objectivity 
even former good guys like cnns jake tapper morphed into an unrecognizable lyingsnarkvirtuesignalingmachines  another rotting cog in the narrative wheel a mindless member of a selfdeluded governmentworshiping cult that wouldnt piss on middle america if we were on fire 
professional sobriety was cast off because this one was in the bag baby and who could miss the historic opportunity to selfrighteously pointandlaugh at the hideous rubes as they were finally and forever being buried alive under a brave new world 
 grind donald trump to dust 
while there is no question trump deserved a few of the kitchen sinks hurled his way never in my  years have i seen such a coordinated desperate dishonest and poisonous campaign to disqualify a human being through the dark art of stripping him and his supporters of all their humanity 
 embracing confirmation bias 
the longer the general election rolled on the smaller the bubble of selfdelusion became 
inconvenient polls were sneered at and voxsplained away 
exit polls could only means one thing even though it was pretty clear they might mean another 
my personal favorite was the late editorials where based on no counted votes whatsoever we were trolled with the news that it was hillary not trump who would emerge victorious with the hidden vote oh the delicious irony of that oh how lovely it would be to rub that in the rubes faces on election night 
by the time the votes were actually being counted i was about  sure hillary would win the new york times however was  sure abcnbccbsapbsnprcnnwashingtonpostpolitico were  sure 
but even i understood that state and local polls were more erratic than ever that hillary did seem legitimately freaked about the upper midwest that the best pollster in the country had trump up  that trump never lost his fervent base that the right trackwrong track numbers had been upside down for a decade that there was still a largerthanusual number of undecideds that this thing that was real might not be enough to win but it was still real 
no no we were told its all smoke and mirrors all goldleafed trump steaks look at obamas approval ratings look at the hispanic vote look at this squirrel and that squirrel and the other squirrel over there sit down son dont you understand that im a data machine its science rube dont you vox racist 
and then the worst thing imaginable happened 
 the media lost the election 
the hate the lies the removal of the mask of objectivity the pushing of every single chip into the middle of the table  that can actually work  if you win 
but the media didnt win 
in the most spectacular fashion with their pants down and their bare ass hanging out for the world to see they lost 
and with that loss went everything 
and now the media is exposed in front of the whole world as a swaggering potemkin bully that no longer has the power to sway public opinion even when they throw absolutely everything they have at one man and do so with much of the republican party on their side 
not only has the media forever been exposed as brazenly dishonest and laughably out of touch worse than all that they are exposed as weak a force no one need ever fear or kowtow to again 
without that sheen of fear without that threat of intimidation like a vanquished bully so goes all their power 
f you mainstream media 
 
the delicious irony of all this is that the last desperate gasp of the political media did actually prove their precious barack obama correct about one thing 
the moral arc of history does indeed bend towards justice

Lloyd Billingsley,hillary clinton and the presidents longer game,"is hillary panicking over the fbi and weiner emails   
these past few days have seen a major shift in the clinton tactics during the original investigation the clinton campaign and its political and media allies launched attacks at republicans for wasting time investigating hillary but did not attack the fbi it misrepresented fbi statements but it certainly did not target investigators in the way were seeing now 
but now we have open hostilities between lynch at the doj and the fbi we have the clinton campaign circulating a letter attacking the fbi we have countless media hit pieces aimed at the fbi 
the obvious question is why the clinton campaign kept its cool at least to some degree before it certainly didnt begin an illadvised campaign against the fbi thats the kind of tactic that may play to your core base but alienates everyone else that is to say everyone who isnt in the media 
so whats going on here 
 the clintons thought they were done its close to the election so theyre lashing out its typically paranoid and nasty behavior by the clintons hillary tried playing humble she tried apologizing but a moment ago her victory seemed inevitable and now shes in a state of fury at having it put at risk 
 there is something in those emails that genuinely frightens the clinton campaign which is why it took the crazy risk of going after the fbi with both barrels its desperate to smear the fbi as much as possible in order to neutralize any revelations or even potential charges the attacks are a warning to treat hillary with kid gloves again or else 
the first is plausible to a degree but for all of hillarys awkwardness she didnt lose it in the past why is she losing it now theres no evidence beyond speculation for the latter and yet the major shift in tactics is rather striking if the clinton campaign were panicking this is what it would look like",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,84.45285857853474,46,7,1873,332,4.61144578313253,332.0,-0.487953588572627,-0.5778293249656962,-0.2925627021001072,-0.2574848291257612,-0.4714196687677186,-0.2519073043026741,0.003012048192771,0.0,0.003012048192771,0,0,0.0,0.0053336222060667,-0.9893,0.078,0.173,0.749,Negative,Very Strong
Daniel Greenfield,dnc head leaked nd debate question to hillary,"the renewed criminal investigation into hillarys misdeeds  and how it could affect the election november   matthew vadum 
democrats are in panic mode a week out from election day as they try to spin away the fbis newly announced discovery of a hoard of twothirds of a million potentially sensitive emails apparently related to hillary clintons catastrophic tenure as americas top diplomat 
partisan hack james carville is spewing wild conspiracy theories 
i think it is an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for fbi director james comey thats what i think 
he added this is in effect an attempt to hijack an election it ought to be called for what it is 
just this past july comey was praised by democrats far and wide for his wisdom in opting not to pursue clinton there is evidence federal officials tried to hinder various investigations of clinton and the endlessly corrupt bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation which functions as a bribe processing center for wouldbe president hillary clinton 
but democrats have suddenly flipped sides denouncing comey as an enemy of the republic now that he has opened an investigation into the newly discovered emails 
carville long known as the ragin cajun is apoplectic because he thinks these emails could change the dynamics of the election 
the old clinton hand may be right 
investigators found  emails on a laptop computer they believe was used at home by disgraced former rep anthony weiner d and his wife longtime senior hillary aide huma abedin the computer is reportedly the same device serial pervert weiner used to send sexual messages to an underage girl 
underlying metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter reports the wall street journal  some of the information emailed may have been classified 
abedin who has intergenerational ties to the muslim brotherhood reportedly forwarded sensitive government information to her personal yahoo email account and may have viewed them on her home laptop 
over the objections of attorney general loretta lynch comey notified congress of the information about the previously unknown emails at this late stage in the election cycle because after letting hillary off the hook this summer he was facing a huge uprising among fbi employees the overwhelming majority of whom are not unprincipled supplicants to power 
lynch is doing her best to make sure the department of justice probe goes nowhere 
assistant attorney general for legislative affairs peter j kadzik whom zero hedge calls the best friend of john podesta hillarys campaign chairman and former white house chief of staff in bill clintons administration is heading up the email probe 
so the fix is in 
in any event the prospect of restoring his good name may also have prompted comey to act 
people are upset at comey because he took the cowards way out in the email investigation and is viewed as helping the clinton team and the obama white house in their efforts to cover up wrongdoing 
it was back on july  comey announced that despite the massive body of damning evidence accumulating against clinton he would not recommend charges be brought against the former secretary of state for her use of hackerfriendly homebrew private email servers to conduct official business clinton and her aides were extremely careless in their handling of classified documents but there was no evidence of criminal intent he said even though the relevant national security statute does not require intent the next day attorney general lynch confirmed no charges would be laid against hillary lynch as everyone now knows had a clandestine meeting with former president bill clinton at a phoenix airport a week before at which a corrupt bargain was presumably made 
this internal rebellion in the investigative agency was serious enough that comey felt he had to act immediately 
i have some sources in the fbi and the former district attorneys commentator larry kudlow said sunday on nbcs meet the press the fbi is in full revolt right now the fbi has been in full revolt since the decisions made last summer 
ever the hillary shill host chuck todd corrected kudlow 
not full revolt he said theres been a lot i mean itsthere are agentslets not say full revolt 
all right a semifull revolt said kudlow 
because what im getting at is if comey hadnt said what he said to congress and the rest of the world it would have leaked it would have leaked that whole building was ready to leak that they had discovered this new source with anthony weiner and huma abedin so i dont think comey had much chance here and i think the fbi is badly divided 
meanwhile the trickle of bad news for hillary clinton has turned into a raging flood in the last few days 
clinton has been directly implicated in a nasty false flag operation against the donald trump campaign top democrat operatives robert creamer and scott foval were caught on undercover video describing their involvement in an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents the euphemism employed was conflict engagement which means paying leftist agitators the homeless and the mentally ill to cause melees at trump rallies 
fomenting violence and physically attacking political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteilung or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers 
longtime democrat pollster and campaign consultant doug schoen a familiar face on fox news channel announced he could no longer in good conscience support clintons candidacy 
im deeply concerned that well have a constitutional crisis if shes elected he said sunday if the secretary of state wins we will have a president under criminal investigation with top aide huma abedin under criminal investigation 
republican donald trump is closing the gap in national polls of likely voters 
clintons unfavorability rating in polls now exceeds trumps shes at  percent hes at  percent 
former new york mayor and leading trump surrogate rudy giuliani said over the weekend that enough evidence has surfaced from wikileaks and the fbi to indict clinton for racketeering bill clinton does the speeches they put the money in the pocket she does the favors in the government said giuliani a former federal prosecutor it all links up why did they destroy  emails because it shows the link

Daniel Pejchl,no title,"see dems accept foreign cash to disrupt trump rallies undercover footage catches hillary operative redhanded published  mins ago bob unruh about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in  after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print 
a hillary clintonsupporting advocacy organization had no trouble accepting a  donation funneled through a belize bank to use in this years presidential election campaign  until its decision was about to be made public in a series of undercover videos by james okeefes project veritas action 
suddenly the head of the organization expressed suspicion about the donations overseas origin and decided to return it 
thats one of the significant revelations in the latest in a series of videos released by okeefe called rigging the election 
okeefe explained he had a fictitious donor meet with bob creamer who was a staffer at americans united for change a group supporting clinton for president until the videos started appearing last week 
he said creamer who boasted of working directly for the clinton campaign directed that the  donation go to aufc to disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops 
okeefe said he and his colleagues were very careful not to violate the law themselves 
creamer was clear about his ties to clinton stating every morning i am on a call at  that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters 
sign the precedentsetting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton 
project veritas first video explained how the clinton campaign uses hidden connections to incite violence at donald trump rallies its second video showed plans for stepbystep voter fraud and the third exposed prohibited communications between hillary clintons campaign the dnc and the nonprofit americans united for change 
the fourth video breaks down the process of the longterm investigation it comes after creamers announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities 
okeefe and project veritas action have filed a complaint with the federal election commission 
among the revelations in the latest video was creamer was boasting of his close links to president obama 
oh barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics i mean the second one i mean the first was good too i was a consultant to both the second one was everything hit on every level and every aspect he said hes a pro ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago 
when asked whether a potential donor could meet obama creamer said ok you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in  days  i was just at an event with him in chicago friday of last week he is just as good as ever i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in i mean for immigration reform for the  the health care bill trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues 
explained project veritas the more that was promised to creamer the more access project veritas action journalists seemed to get project veritas actions  investment paid off the story was solid robert creamer scott foval jenna price from the dnc brad woodhouse from aufc cesar vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings as seen in the three previous pva videos 
in the first video foval a democratic operative boasted of what he called conflict engagement or sending protesters to disrupt trump events 
were starting anarchy here he said and he needs to understand that were starting anarchy 
in the second video creamer explained clintons direct control over those disruption operations 
in the end it was the candidate hillary clinton the future president of the united states who wanted ducks on the ground so by god we would get ducks on the ground creamer said 
creamer the husband of democratic rep jan schakowsky of illinois has starred in several of the undercover videos 
heres the third 
that video also revealed a direct conflict between what creamer was confirming  clintons active involvement in such decisions and campaigns  and the claim of her campaign manager robby mook 
mook told cnn over the weekend that there was no pathway between the activists staging violence and clinton 
sign the precedentsetting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton 
these individuals no longer have a relationship with the dnc he said theyve never had a relationship with the clinton campaign and my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened i think in february of last year 
they did not have a contract with the dnc until june but putting all that aside this was again a video that was leaked out with the purpose of damaging the campaign it is edited so we dont know what the full context is and theres no evidence whatsoever  that anyone ever did anything like this when they were working for the dnc 
his comments 
after confirming it was clinton or wanted ducks on the ground creamer warned undercover project veritas journalists dont repeat that to anybody 
creamer ran democracy partners a consulting company with ties to clinton 
he has been to the white house  times while obama has been president including  meetings directly with obama 
okeefes organization reported that the coordination between the campaign the dnc and the americans united for change smacks of illegal coordinated campaign expenditures 
last week  project veritas filed a complaint with the federal election commission asking for an investigation into the clinton campaigns criminal conspiracy 
the filing of the complaint with the federal agency follows the release of two videos in which democrats explain how they can attempt to change the outcome of the election through apparently fraudulent means such as having people travel across state lines to vote illegally 
the video have resulted already in two democratic operatives losing their jobs 
editors note be aware of offensive language throughout videos and in quotes from videos 
one is scott foval who had worked for people for the american way a george sorosfunded group and more recently with americans united for change 
in the video he said you know what weve been busing people in to deal with you fing aes for  years and were not going to stop now 
also he said he and his agents are starting anarchy by creating conflict engagement  in the lines at trump rallies 
also out of work is creamer 
see the second video 
talkradio icon rush limbaugh said the evidence is worrisome 
every trump rally would feature none of this violence unless the democrats were paying for it i think its a big deal folks the media is complicit they know who these people are  theyre in on it theyre part of the game  none of its organic none of its natural none of its real every bit of it is bought and paid for 
democrats cant leave elections to chance because they know that despite the way it may look the majority of americans would not support them if they knew who they are

british prime minister theresa may is facing growing criticism over her comments about brexit at a leaked private speech to goldman sachs 
the premier who has publicly made the case for a hard brexit following a june referendum speaks of the benefits of being an eu member in the hourlong session whose audio file was leaked to the guardian on tuesday night drawing harsh criticism on wednesday 
i think the economic arguments are clear i think being part of a  million population trading bloc is significant for us i think as i was saying to you a little earlier that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the uk because it is the uk in europe she is heard saying if we were not in europe i think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say do they need to develop a mainland europe presence rather than a uk presence so i think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms 
the leader of the rival labour party jeremy corbyn attacked the prime minister for having failed to address her own concerns about leaving the european union

the prime minister has given her private views on brexit to goldman sachs bankers but refuses to give the british people a clear plan for negotiations said the labour leader it shouldnt take a leaked tape for the public to find out what she really thinks 
the former labour leader and leading member of the open britain campaign group ed miliband also reacted to the comments saying the leaked comments prove that may shares the concerns of all the britons on brexit 
if private warnings are to be matched by proper public debate it is essential that the government is not allowed to hoard vital analysis of the impact on our economy of leaving the single market this work is being done in government and it must now be published he said asserting that mays comments demonstrated that the prime minister was just as worried privately as the rest of us are publicly about the economic impact of the hard destructive brexit her government seems set on

Amy Goodrich,study running linked to extended lifespan and brain repair,"the end game closes in on the clintons as the deep state turns massive collection of criminally damning evidence about to be revealed that will bring down the clinton crime family forever 
wednesday november   tags deep state  clinton cartel  damning evidence naturalnews my fellow americans we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime as of today i am now convinced that the deep state has turned on hillary clinton and will unveil damning evidence in the next few days that will end the clintons reign of terror over america and collapse her bid for the presidencythe mainstream media of course will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal clinton cartel as such they will lie to the public to the bitter end even as the clinton titanic sinks with all of them on board in deep frigid waters no less with no more lifeboats to be foundthe socalled deep state  the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy  has decided hillary clinton is too damaged to defend any longer  even if she were to win by stealing the election she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survivalit has now been decided i believe that hillary clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the nsa and fbi this will likely happen before the coming weekend once that is accomplished the next goal will be to wait for president trump to take office then destroy the us economy through a controlled global debt collapse so that trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies remember the deep state isnt protrump theyre still all about defending the establishment but hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomachinstead of allowing hillary clinton to take power and destroy america from the top in other words deep state power brokers have reverted to plan b which is to let trump take the white house then destroy america through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy this is simpler than it sounds bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly  trillion in national debt isnt exactly rocket science all they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates monetary gravity will do the restin the mean time hillary clinton and a long list of her coconspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice  lying under oath destruction of evidence conspiracy corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for manythe criminal racket of the clintons is about to implode the participants will be charged under the rico act for racketeering activities for which ample evidence already exists a new video from steve pieczenik describes some of this in this video intelligence insider steve pieczenik lays out how highlevel intelligence insiders are now working in concert to reverse the clinton coup thats attempting to take over america and destroy it from withineven if you dont believe pieczenik  and i fully realize hes controversial in his own way  this short video is a very important must watch explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing weve initiated a countercoup the clintons are going to go full murder in a last ditch desperate effort to save themselves beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days like a cornered wild animal the clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going full murder in an attempt to save themselvesi will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes swimming pool accidents or natural deaths involving people like james comey whod better have armed security personnel around him at all timeslook for desperate measures such as the clintons attempting to blackmail obama comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins we might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days although thats increasingly unlikely since it seems the clintons are now on their own they would need the assistance of obama to pull off another sandy hook you see a deal has already been struck with obama most likely deep state operatives have already struck a deal with obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as hillary clintons head is served up on a platter this likely explains why obama is now publicly saying he trusts comey and refuses to go to bat for hillary theres no love lost between obama and the clintons remember as all this is going down the propaganda ministry of the clinton regime  cnn nyt washington post etc  is going to explode into an allout batst crazy conspiracy theory phase where they blame the russians extraterrestrials bigfoot and the loch ness monster for everything thats imploding around the clintons mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke maybe crop circles were created by the russians as a secret code to wikileaks and donald trump ehmeanwhile conspiratorial operatives like george stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition  so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put hillary in the white house via any means at their disposal including totally faking negative news against donald trump which is of course the entire news mission of cnn at this point a disgraced propaganda network run by antiamerican traitors if the vote is stolen for hillary clinton all hell breaks loose should the globalist soros operators manage to steal the vote bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place hillary clinton in the white house all hell breaks loose across america  the fbi goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the clinton criminal regime donald trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud the rigging of voting machines the attempted bribery of electoral voters and so on the us military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose clinton and restore democracy this one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated and yes you will beg for a shortterm military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose clinton and restore open fair and free elections armed us citizens prepare for a massive march on washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite dont get away with corruption fraud and murder expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds the nsa likely goes into full dump mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against hillary clinton this will likely be joined by cia assets who already have the goods on the clintons and their lolita express pedo joy rides wikileaks anonymous and every former nsa analyst goes into destroy the clintons mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the clintons and anyone close to them anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help i expect kim dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward hillary clinton as do we all come to think of it the establishment republicans in the us congress will as usual meekly surrender to the democrats pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because thats what they do best when the going gets tough totally useless politicrats like john mccain cant get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something these useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of washington as the revolution unfolds replaced with individuals who actually honor the us constitution like rep louie gohmert i root for all groups working to save america and expose the criminal politicians bring out the marshmallows and weiners folks this is going to be the most bizarre campfire front row seat to us history that anyone has witnessed in over  years try not to trip and face plant into the flames as all this unfolds it might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready since no one really knows just how nasty this is all going to get and thank god hillary doesnt have her fingers on the nuclear launch codes or shed probably launch them just to change the narrativeas for me im with anybody whos trying to save america  restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison like almost everybody else ive had enough of the lies the corruption the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking parasites in washington dc who are too arrogant and stupid to realize just how much theyre universally despised the revolution is on anonymous wikileaks project veritas the fbi and the nsa have all been activated theres no stopping them now and all the details of all the crimes of the clintons are about to spill onto the stage of history dirty deeds and allbe warned you are probably not psychologically prepared for the truth about what the clintons really are you will probably vomit health ranger approved aquatru water filter back in stock

it was a fitting capstone to a remarkable  months for clinton on the lucrative california fundraising circuit this final event anchored by a host committee of billionaires hollywood executives media moguls and tech investors  sean parker jeffrey katzenberg haim saban chris sacca  that each directed  to clintons efforts 
clinton calls them her hillblazers campaign bundlers who have given or raised at least  for her campaign and she has erected an unparalleled and unprecedented infrastructure of  such people  nearly double the number of any past presidential candidate including president obama four years ago 
while clinton and her advisers like to tout her small online donors it is these bundlers in more than  states and four foreign countries who form the true backbone of her financial operation combined this elite andup club has amassed a minimum of  million for clinton and the democratic party  and the actual figure is likely far far higher than that the biggest bundlers typically collect millions for campaigns 
we had the best base of donors and bundlers and raisers ever in  it was even better in  and its much better in  than  said wade randlett a san franciscobased democrat who has raised money for clinton obama and democratic causes for decades the obama people basically  percent in are favor of hillary theres really no loss because of ideology or bad blood and she has added an enormous number of people especially women 
among her bundlers are celebrities will smith and sports stars earvin magic johnson hollywood directors steven spielberg and george lucas and corporate executives marissa mayer and sheryl sandberg wall streettypes marc lasry media executives haim saban and anna wintour and members of congress including her running mate sen tim kaine who helped raise more than  for clinton before he joined the ticket in july 
the clinton campaign said  percent of its bundlers are women 
there are also federal lobbyists from whom the democratic party under obama refused to accept money a prohibition that has since been rolled back 
this club has expanded to the point where clinton would now struggle to fit all of these bundlers into a single ballroom as of the end of june she counted  such individuals and couples by the end of july it was  on august  it was  
it includes billionaires george soros warren buffett and tom steyer super lobbyists like steve elmendorf and boldfaced names like calvin klein and jj abrams there is also a sprinkling of longtime clinton family advisers such as vernon jordan",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,78,14,2963,487,5.008213552361396,487.0,0.4904476704060184,0.7374756820870908,-0.0041795823251473,-0.0144943066658723,-0.079848791812603,-0.0032357587462324,0.0041067761806981,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0062015459983308,0.9838,0.093,0.03,0.877,Positive,Very Strong

Daniel Greenfield,obamas doj hasnt approved warrant for fbi of new hillary emails,"dems file complaint wdoj against fbi for investigating hillary   
its an obviously absurd move but considering that the doj has become a transparently political organization that abuses and attacks law enforcement on a regular basis including in the eric garner case the fbi this is just how things work in the hall of mirrors that the left has made  
the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint with the department of justice office of professional responsibility on friday against fbi director james comey for interfering in the presidential election following the fbis decision to open up an investigation into secretary clintons emails this close to election day federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act 
it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only  days to go before the election said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house just to undermine her campaign comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america not investigating our soon to be presidentelect hillary clinton 
its silly grandstanding and seems easy enough to dismissexcept that bizarre and unlikely tactics no longer are there was outrage over moveons attack on petraeus and even most dems thought that it was unhelpful this attack on comey i suspect will meet with little criticism some dems will consider it a helpful preemptive move even though with his track record comey is as likely to hurt hillary as he is himself",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,63,11,1646,266,5.161654135338346,266.0,0.0318220802597783,0.1737735362073249,-0.352620471080764,-0.3609517612699719,0.0715820155676485,-0.357793252733159,0.0075187969924812,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0149888836932055,-0.9915,0.063,0.191,0.746,Negative,Very Strong

Michael Sebastian,how to live after trump,"are the polls rigged against trump all of these wildly divergent surveys cannot possibly be correct michael on television half of the population of the world is dirt poor  and the global elite want to keep it that way   nd  
could you survive on just  a day according to compassion international  approximately half of the population of the entire planet currently lives on  a day or less meanwhile those hoarding wealth at the very top of the global pyramid are rapidly becoming a lot wealthier dont get me wrong  i am a very big believer in working hard and contributing something of value to society and those that work the hardest and contribute the most should be able to reap the rewards in this article i am in no way shape or form criticizing true capitalism because if true capitalism were actually being practiced all over the planet we would have far far less poverty today instead our planet is dominated by a heavily socialized debtbased central banking system that systematically transfers wealth from hard working ordinary citizens to the global elite those at the very top of the pyramid know that they are impoverishing everyone else and they very much intend to keep it that way 
lets start with some of the hard numbers according to zero hedge  credit suisse had just released their yearly report on global wealth and it shows that  percent of all the wealth in the world is controlled by just  percent of the people 
as credit suisse tantalizingly shows year after year the number of people who control just shy of a majority of global net worth or  of the roughly  trillion in household wealth is declining progressively relative to the total population of the world and in  the number of people who are worth more than  million was just  million roughly  of the worlds population of adults on the other end of the pyramid some  billion adults had a net worth of less than  accounting for just about  trillion in household wealth 
and since this is a yearly report we can go back and see how things have changed over time when zero hedge did this it was discovered that the wealth of those at the very top has nearly doubled over the past six years and meanwhile the poor have gotten even poorer 
incidentally we tracked down the first credit suisse report we found in this series from   where the total wealth of the top layer in the pyramid was a modest  trillion for the worlds millionaires it has nearly doubled in the  years since then meanwhile the worlds poorest have gotten you got it poorer as those adults who were worth less than  in  had a combined net worth of  trillion a number which has since declined to  trillion in  despite a half a billion increase in the sample size 
if these trends continue at this pace it wont be too long before the global elite have virtually all of the wealth and the rest of us have virtually nothing 
perhaps you are fortunate enough to still have a good job and you live in a large home and you will sleep in a warm bed tonight 
well you should consider yourself to be very blessed because that is definitely not the case for most of the rest of the world the following  facts about global poverty come from dosomethingcom  and i want you to really let these numbers sink in for a moment nearly  of the worlds population  more than  billion people  live on less than  a day more than  billion live in extreme poverty  less than  a day  billion children worldwide are living in poverty according to unicef  children die each day due to poverty  million people worldwide do not have enough food to eat  food banks are especially important in providing food for people that cant afford it themselves run a food drive outside your local grocery store so people in your community have enough to eat sign up for supermarket stakeout  more than  million people lack adequate access to clean drinking water  diarrhea caused by inadequate drinking water sanitation and hand hygiene kills an estimated  people every year globally or approximately  people per day in   million children under the age  were stunted reduced rate of growth and development due to chronic malnutrition preventable diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia take the lives of  million children a year who are too poor to afford proper treatment as of   million children under  year of age worldwide had not received the three recommended doses of vaccine against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis  of all humans live without electricity  approximately  billion people  of the world population lives on less than  a day  oxfam estimates that it would take  billion annually to end extreme global povertythats less than  the income of the top  richest billionaires the world food programme says the poor are hungry and their hunger traps them in poverty hunger is the number one cause of death in the world killing more than hivaids malaria and tuberculosis combined 
so how did we get here 
debt is the primary mechanism that takes wealth from ordinary people like you and me and puts it into the hands of the global elite 
in my recent article entitled  why donald trump must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money  i discussed how the federal reserve was designed to entrap the us government in an endless debt spiral from which it could never possibly escape and that is precisely what has happened as the us national debt has gotten more than  times larger since the federal reserve was created in  
in that very same year the federal income tax was instituted and that is a key part of the program for the global elite you see the income tax is how wealth is transferred from us to the government and then a continuously growing national debt is how that wealth is transferred from the government to the elite 
it is a very complicated system but at the end of the day it is all about taking money from us and getting it into their pockets 
and at this point more than  percent of the population of the world lives in a country with a central bank and almost every nation on the planet has some form of income tax 
it is a global system that is designed to create as much debt as possible and i recently shared with my readers that the total amount of debt in the world has hit a staggering   of  trillion dollars  
interestingly the bible actually foretells of a time when rich men would hoard wealth in the last days the following are the first five verses of the book of james in the modern english version  
come now you rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you  your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten  your gold and silver are corroded and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire you have stored up treasures for the last days  indeed the wages that you kept back by fraud from the laborers who harvested your fields are crying and the cries of those who harvested have entered into the ears of the lord of hosts  you have lived in pleasure on the earth and have been wayward you have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter 
so much of the time we focus on the other great sins that we see all around us but the truth is that one of the greatest sins of all in our world today is the sin of greed 
the borrower is the servant of the lender and the global elite have used various forms of debt to turn the rest of the planet into their debt slaves 
as debt levels race higher and higher all over the planet the elite are using the magic of compound interest to grab a bigger and bigger share of the pie 
given enough time those at the very top would have virtually everything and the rest of us would have virtually nothing the middle class is shrinking all over the globe and the gap between the wealthy and the poor continues to grow at an astounding pace 
but the vast majority of people out there have no idea how money debt taxes and central banks really work and so they have no idea that this is purposely being done to them 
so please share this article with as many people as you can the truth is that we dont have to have this much global poverty and if we correctly identify the root causes of this poverty we can start working on some real solutions",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,69.75523622326341,23,5,8213,1474,4.504070556309363,1474.0,-1.1911794934635285,-0.9536307555522068,1.3848216826459898,1.5328066331270973,-0.5773884872836942,1.5802404700551094,0.0006784260515603,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0010244752039305,0.9652,0.111,0.088,0.801,Positive,Very Strong
Paul Reinhardt,no title,"click for full size picturek my theory 
my theory of the downing of the aircraft is derived from the two reported wreckage sites the lie about the weather given out by the government and the loss of three radio links at the same time while the plane was still  miles from the crash site signs the plane was sabotaged 
first off the claims made in both time and newsweek that ron browns plane crashed in the worst storm in a decade are directly contradicted by the weather report issued by the dubrovnik airport tower adjacent to the crash site the storm simply did not exist 
while the plane carrying ron brown and his party was still  miles from the crash site  mile in the air and on the normal approach path three radio based links with three separate propagation paths all failed at the same time 
according to the aviation week  space technology article the dubrovnik tower lost voice radio contact at the same time the aircraft vanished from the screens of the approach radar at split and an awacs 
lets look at the split radar first 
the split radar watches the approach to dubrovnik airport which is where the ron brown aircraft was when it dropped off of the radar screen contrary to some silly claims made in this newsgroup before the plane was not flying in the mountains it was out over the water with open space all around the radar at split routinely tracks aircraft through that airspace without problem if it were normal for the split radar to lose traffic at that point on the approach path nobody would have mentioned it because it would be normal and expected behavior nothing unusual about it that comment was made about the target dropping off of the split radar establishes that it was an unusual event 
the split radar like all atc radar tracks primarily by aircraft transponder so when the split radar lost track of the ron brown aircraft what was lost was the transponder return as the aircraft was still on the approach path although just starting to veer slightly left 
now lets look at the awacs 
the awacs system is designed to track nontranspondered targets radar hits are placed in a computer system that keeps a list and tries to match the returns from the present radar sweep to the returns from the previous sweeps in order to generate meaningful target tracking data for the operators and weapons management systems part of that process involves target to target comparisons to make certain that what the computer thinks is target xyz this sweep is the same target it thought was xyz last sweep the total workload on the computer is a power function of the total number of nontranspondered targets being carried in the target list 
if a target has a transponder the awacs will track the target using the transponder return because not only is less computer power needed for a transpondered target but the workload for nontranspondered targets is reduced 
how do we know that the awacs was tracking the ron brown plane via transponder because the awacs lost its track at the same time that the split radar lost its transponder return had the awacs been tracking the ron brown plane via skinpaint there is no reason for it to lose track of the aircraft at the same time that split did 
had the awacs not reported losing contact we could surmise that either the awacs was tracking on skin paint or the split radar suffered a momentary failure but this was not the case 
it is also true that the awacs could have immediately reacquired the ron brown aircraft on skin paint and its not known for a fact that the computers did not add it as a nontranspondered target but the awacs was there to watch bosnia not the dubrovnik airport 
the two radar tracks propagating along two different paths come together at only one common point where a single failure could make the aircraft vanish from both split and the awacs and that is the radar transponder in the ron brown aircraft a failure of the transponder is the only explanation for the ron brown plane vanishing from two different radar screens at the same time while still  miles from the crash site and  mile above the adriatic sea 
at the same time that the aircraft vanished from the radars at split and the awacs the dubrovnik tower reported it lost voice radio contact with the aircraft 
this is a third distinct propagation path from the awacs and split in fact its direct line of sight from the dubrovnik tower to the location on the approach path where radio contact was lost there are no intervening geological features to block the radio signal the dubrovnik tower continued to communicate with other aircraft in the area so the radios in the tower were not at fault 
the data reported in the aviation week  space technology article shows evidence that two sperate systems on board the ron brown aircraft failed at the same time the cockpit radios and the radar transponder 
the radios and radar transponders come together at only one common point where a single failure could make the aircraft vanish from both split and the awacs and lose voice radio contact with the dubrovnik tower and that is is the electrical system failed in mid air while still  miles from the crash site and  mile above the adriatic sea on the approach path how do we know the problem extended beyond the electrical system 
simple prior to the loss of radio the flight crew had acknowledged receiving a weather report they knew there was clear air beneath them there is only one reason for the flight crew suddenly without any instruments at all not to descend out of a cloud layer into the clear air they knew was below them and thats if the event that severed the electrical cables also severed the flight control cables which occupy the same midline conduit in the  possible trigger 
given the unscheduled nature of the trip a timer would be useless to pinpoint the exact geographic location of the detonation however knowing the approach pattern into the airport a location over the adriatic can be selected by the altitude of the aircraft along the glide slope 
the simplest explanation which fits the twin wreckage sites and the early news reports of a water crash is that of an altitude triggered bomb placed on the aircraft prior to departure as the aircraft climbs above a certain altitude the device is armed as the aircraft descends through the trigger altitude say  feet the device detonates why did the plane make it to shore 
as the reports have pointed out the weather was not ideal the pilot even with the best navigation aids in the world would be fully justified in delaying his descent in order to stay in clear air as long as possible then ducking quickly down through the clouds to find the airfield 
this means that the altitude triggered bomb would have detonated far closer to land than expected with the result that portions of the wreckage came on shore 
the  mile spread between wreckage sites indicates an airborne event which blew part of the aircraft off the same  mile distance coupled with the shallow impact angle suggests that the aircraft was still flyable and that the pilot may have been trying to make it to the airfield when the crash into the hill occurred was thermite used 
its impossible to state based on the information available to the public but thermite is a definite possibility it can be made using available materials and will not show up on the various detectors which would sense chemical explosives such as c thermite when ignited burns at half the temperature of the surface of the sun and would burn through the aluminum of an aircraft with ease packed in a suitcase near the top of the baggage compartment of the converted  it would be in an ideal location to sever the control linkages and to short out the planes electrical system as well as burning a hole through the skin dumping debris into the ocean how bad was the weather 
there were several reports in the media that dubrovnik was in the grip of the worst storm of the decade this is not true as can be seen by the weather information contained in the aviation week article and the first news articles from reuters the weather was not exceptionally bad indeed the wind conditions were excellent providing a  knot head wind with no cross component at the runway perfect landing conditions below the overcast at  feet visibility was km or  miles assorted news articles washington april  upi  a us air force plane carrying commerce secretary ron brown in the

wednesday on the fate of his friend and political ally commerce secretary ron brown made emotional visits to browns home and the federal department where he spoke to distraught federal workers after hearing mid morning that the military plane carrying brown had crashed near the adriatic coast in croatia clinton wasted little time in sharing his grief and trying to console the brown family friends and workers the browns have a son michael and a daughter tracey a family spokesman said the browns were still holding out hope the president and first lady hillary rodham clinton dressed in dark suits and wearing solemn faces spent nearly an hour at browns washington home where he lived with his wife alma couriers also arrived with flowers from wellwishers and the secret service checked each bunch before allowing them into the townhouse the clintons emerged from the home located in the affluent secluded chatworth neighborhood of washington with their heads down and the first lady appearing to choke back tears brown was head of the democratic national committee when clinton was the partys presidential nominee in  and he was greatly credited with playing a key role in putting a democrat in the white house after the visit with the family the clintons immediately headed across town to commerce department headquarters where the president addressed employees who packed the auditorium clinton told the gathering that he his wife and other administration officials came to be with the employees of the commerce department at this very difficult hour the plane carrying secretary brown and his delegation including a number of your colleagues business leaders and leaders of the united states military went down today near dubrovnik croatia clinton told the workers we do not know for sure what happened there clinton said he asked browns wife what he should tell the department workers she said tell them ron was proud of them that he liked them that he believed in them and that he fought for the commerce department and tell them that youre going to do that now clinton said winning sustained applause from the crowd many of the hundreds of department employees were visibly shaken at the news with many crying and others holding and consoling one another also present at the commerce department when clinton spoke were several cabinet secretaries including attorney general janet reno agriculture secretary dan glickman housing and urban development secretary henry cisneros health and human services secretary donna shalala education secretary richard riley and interior secretary bruce babbitt vice president al gore and the first lady also joined clinton at the commerce department earlier sen ted kennedy dmass visited the brown family to express his condolences brown was kennedys chief of staff before going to the urban league and democratic national committee clinton named him commerce secretary in  another visitor was vernon jordan former head of the urban league and now a highpowered washington lawyer and unofficial adviser to clinton  a us air force t which is the military equivalent of a bowing  carrying brown and his entourage from tuzla to dubrovnik crashed into a mountain near the adriatic sea coast but officials were writing off the possibility of foul play there hasnt been any report over here indicating anything hostile but again we cant confirm that white house spokesman mike mccurry said republicans in congress have been working to dismantle the commerce department although a gop aide said wednesday the effort may be scrapped following the crash of browns plane washington reuter  president clintons wife hillary and daughter chelsea flew on the same plane last week that crashed in croatia with commerce secretary ron brown aboard us air force sources said wednesday a military version of the widely used boeing  passenger jet flew mrs clinton and her yearold daughter from the turkish capital of ankara to the ancient biblical city of ephesus and on to istanbul last wednesday the ta plane with a tail number of  was based at the us air base at ramstein germany the sources said mrs clinton used it rather than the boeing  assigned to her for a weeklong goodwill tour of southern europe because of the short runway at ephesus the same plane was used to ferry defense secretary william perry in and out of bosnia last week mrs clinton also visited the yugoslav region during her trip but used a giant c military cargo jet for that leg of her journey

the case of the vanishing visa files  
december    pm pst  
by chuck goudie   
december   chicago  potentially important evidence has disappeared in a terrorism case involving two chicago men their visa records vanished from chicagos indian consulate it comes one week after the abc  iteam raised questions about how david coleman headley and tahawwur rana obtained their foreign visas in the first place 

the case of the vanishing visa records has churned up diplomats from mumbai to michigan avenue indias foreign secretary nirupama rao told reporters overseas wednesday that she wants answers from chicagos indian consulate about the records and visa documents that have disappeared records that might show how two accused chicago terrorists obtained permission to scout targets in india 

top officials of chicagos india consulate wouldnt talk to the iteam on camera last week when asked how terror suspects david coleman headley and tahawwur rana obtained fiveyear unlimited passage visas to india 

and the consul general did not return calls wednesday regarding the paperwork they used to process headley and ranas visas which indian foreign secretary nirupama rao announced wednesday have disappeared 

wednesday evening the chicago consul general emailed a statement to the iteam that conflicted with government statements made in india the brief statement read we have not reported loss of any papers regarding issuance of visa to david coleman headley and tahawwur rana hussain relevant information concerning the issuance of visa to these persons is available with the government of india 

indias counterpart to the fbi is looking into the visa application process as part of its probe into the  mumbai massacre 

the two chicago suspects are accused of having roles in the assault rana was denied bond by a chicago district judge tuesday despite family members and friends offering  million in cash and property rana has not been directly charged with the mumbai attack that left  dead but was linked to the assault in government court filings 

headley a pakistanborn chicagoan is a convicted heroin dealer whose birth name was daood giliani he changed his name to ease travel to india according to federal prosecutors in chicago and to avoid the required previsa background check by indian authorities 

since the time headley and rani were processed indias chicago consulate office began contracting out visa requests to a private company called travisa outsourcing that on its website claims we have revolutionized the way people get their visas 

and the new visa processing was subject of a news conference last year 

the advantages of outsourcing is the travisa company which is handling the outsourcing has set up a call center said ashok kumar attri consul general 

foreign secretary rao said she is impressed with the cooperation the us has given to indian investigators headley and rana are not due back in court until january

barack obama was assigned to michelle obama in summer  this may have reflected how few blacks there were at sidley austin especially from harvard law school or the equivalent dohrn got her jd from university of chicago law school since she is a prof at northwestern despite her background we might infer she was very smart and understanding so she was the perfect person to be the mentor for michelle obama at sidley austin

breaking hillaryclintons email server company got almost  million in govt loans after wiping emails   
october

give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information

police conclude search of starnet   
cbc news posted aug    am et last updated aug    am et  
police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of starnet communications in vancouver they entered the company offices and homes of some directors on friday 

police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling distributing child pornography and money laundering since the raid starnet officials say police just dont understand their business 

the search warrant details  months of police investigation it traces a network of companies registered in american and caribbean jurisdictions 

the warrant also identifies vancouver as the centre of starnets operations even though this is a grey under canadian law 

police note that starnets revenues grew dramatically in the past two years from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software the investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for fridays raid and seizure of company materials 

rcmp constable peter thiessen says investigators left starnet offices yesterday morning he says they spent the better part of three days going through the business and as a result of that search the investigation is continuing but no charges have been laid starnets many investors were spooked by the raid share prices dropped almost percent on friday however the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading 

in written statements company ceo mark dohlen said the wall street journal calls starnet the leader in internet gaming and entertainment he says companies like his those on the cutting edge are often misunderstood yesterday starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business it plans to focus more resources on gaming 

the police investigation is expected to last for several more months

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

No Author,people arrested for food stamp fraud guess how many were black,"on november    pm  
it was just a few days ago that bernie sanders responded to trumps election win with the perfect message from democrats he said  
if donald trump takes peoples anger and turns it against muslims hispanics african americans and women we will be his worst nightmare 
and from what was just announced it seems that sanders has every intention of making good on that warning earlier today the vermont senator was named chair of outreach during a closeddoor senate democrat caucus meeting according to the hill  in his new role sanders will lead outreach to bluecollar voters  the very voters who became trump supporters this year sanders will also be the ranking member on the senate budget committee acknowledging that he has a heavy responsibility to help shape the priorities of the united states government sanders said im going to do everything that i can to make sure that the budget that leaves the united states congress is a budget that represents the needs of working families and a shrinking middle class and not billionaires with the announcement of sanders new position trump is definitely going to be a nervous wreck hes spent his entire presidential campaign claiming that he would help the working class and now sanders is in the position to challenge him and hold him to it for the next four years by elevating sanders to this new role democrats are moving to a more grassroots message fully aware that sanders presidential campaign and vision for america resonated with many voters as we saw with sanders popularity in the primaries the vermont senator struck a nerve with workers and families making him the perfect candidate to go up against trump as he takes office sen debbie stabenow dmich commented on sanders new responsibility we want to expand on that and he will be reaching out to all our allies we have a tremendous amount of talent in our caucus and we want to make sure everyone is contributing sanders hardly needed this promotion to upset trump as hes been one of the most outspoken politicians on twitter since trumps win twitter twitter twitter 
however sanders new role is great news for our country and we know hes going to give trump hell

Ness Nomadison,reasons why you should try photography as a hobby,"home  badge abuse  parents on a date were asleep in car when cops arrived and killed them both parents on a date were asleep in car when cops arrived and killed them both matt agorist february    comments 
inglewood ca  on sunday police responded to a call of a suspicious vehicle parked on manchester boulevard around  am when police arrived they engaged in a minute long standoff before opening fire on the man and woman inside the vehicle killing them both 
in the news release on monday following the shooting police claimed that the woman in the car had a gun scott collins a spokesman for the inglewood police department said that the couple refused to obey the officers commands to exit the vehicle the officers then feared for their safety and opened fire on the car  killing the couple 
the woman was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting and the man succumbed to his injuries after paramedics transported him to a local hospital according to the la times 
the shooting seemed like an open and shut case until the next day mayor james butts while responding to questions about the shooting opened up a huge can of worms  both the man and the woman were unconscious 
for at least  minutes police attempted to rouse them in an effort to deescalate the situation said butts 
after admitting that the couple was asleep butts quickly defended the officers noting obviously at some point they were conscious because somebody felt threatened 
however that notion has yet to be proven and is particularly unlikely due to the fact that not a single officer received so much as a scratch nor did the couple have any reason to be violent 
both of the victims were parents kisha michael  a single mother of three sons and marquintan sandlin  a single father of four daughters 
michaels twin sister trisha stated the obvious when she said that its possible that kisha merely passed out on the way home from their night out 
families for both described them as devoted parents who made arrangements for care of their children while they took a night off according to nbc los angeles 
the police aint telling us nothing said trisha michael after being met with tight lips from the department 
he was a loving father said sandlins sister leandra faulkner all he cared about was his girls getting them right 
of course as is standard procedure for all those killed by police their arrest records were released to shame them michael was on probation for a misdemeanor last year and  years ago sandlin was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in los angeles 
according to his relatives sandlin had a rough life but had turned it around and was working as a successful truck driver 
sadly these children will now grow up knowing that their parents were taken from them by cops scared of a sleeping couple share google  concerned citizen 
perhaps the mother had the gun on her lap for protection while they slept at least they didnt drive drunk these parents did not deserve to die mary hagerty 
did she really have a gun or did the cops just say that to excuse the murders of two sleeping people lying about weapons is a known police tactic to get out of trouble sometimes they go as far as to plant a weapon conscious 
lets say they had a gun how did the police see it if they were asleep hmmm that makes it irrelevant john and linda robel 
who gives a fuck about driving drunk it is determined by an arbitrary number that is extorted by the united states congresswe encourage people everyday to annul this police statist horseshit a felony can be expunged but not a fucking misdomeanor dui get a grip this nothing but a government racket and proffiteering of the dui industry kevin burnett

they may or may not have had a gun but having a gun is no reason for the police to shoot  kill someone nikkia bailey

marie laveaux  im not disagreeing with you i just always like to see some real info before i jump to conclusions not just a headline i have no idea what happened and will not put blame on either side unless i see some hard evidence julie asperger 
on los angeles local news report they said the vehicle was stopped in the middle of manchester blvd not parked on the side of the road both are illegal seemed strange the way it was presented to us this makes it even weirder i passed by and seen there is a large memorial for them to bad there is no video to see what really happened 
cops dont like being filmed 
for obvious reasons julie asperger 
yea i was harassed by some a few years back on hollywood blvd and intimidated into deleting video of them using excessive force on cooperating men i even showed them my press id and tried to be allowed to keep the video they said fuck the press kimberly reichard emerson 
the intelligent of us know were not i cant even comprehend whats wrong with the people here that still believe were in the land of the free and home of the brave its frightening to say the least shawn soto 
this is so fucked upwtf is wrong with people why cant any one just act right all you fuckers carrying so much hate on raceits ridiculous im sick of it an alot if peeps an i mean alot are following an feeding this shit through media an all i hve mad love for all race in the world am does any one even hve a pure blood line now a days i think not so dont be fooled by just the way your skin looks 
we all belong to the human race theres no other race than that thom prentice 
nice infotisments colin parker 
i never understood why their prior arrest recods are released its not admissible in any court for a current charge so why are the police allowed to use it alan lammle 
to help soften the public in their attempt to make them look like they did nothing wrong in shooting  people in cold blood gary harryman 
shouldnt the records of every cop at that scene also be released tray pressley 
to label them as criminals so they can justify the murder markymark ndahouse 
to demonize the dead jamesawyatt 
as long as bureaucrats are allowed to hire with little or no supervision those who seek to be employed as cops many of whom have a history of being bullies going back through their childhood and who seek this means of furthering their bullying lust now armed with impressive uniform shiny new badge and deadly weapons and with the presumptions that they now have a license to beat cripple and shoot when ever and whom ever they please atrocities are expected to be the norm and will be expected to grow at an exponential rate it is forever hoped that one or more law firms will come into being that will relentlessly undertake the filing of suits and not only agains the involved jurisdiction and the individual rogue cop or cops but those who were involved in the hiring of the cop or cops the impression always being that these who are responsible for the hiring and thus are as guilty as the involved rogue cops  they have to be faced with the harsh reality by having levied against each and every offender hugh awardsfines not just on the jurisdiction ie the city county state or feds    but also against each of the individual involved in their being hirsd    as well as the rogue cop or cops themselves as individuals the awards to be paid by the individuals by their prorated award share payment out of their own pockets and only a prorated share by the jurisdiction as what the jurisdiction pays will invariably come out of the pockets of that jurisdictions tax payers stiff penalties in the form of huge financial judgement awards should go a long long way in fostering an awareness by these who have escaped accountability for so so long of the potentially very expensive folly of this their irresponsible actions which results in so much suffering and many time crippling injury andor death mary hagerty 
i agree but please dont use all caps to write its way harder to read roberto carlos moscoso 
sadly the government insists that they want to take guns away from civilians for only police officers have training and are responsible enough to handle guns yet ive seen more mass shootings and innocent people dying in the hands of cops than in the hands of irresponsible citizens crazy ah tracy walling otis 
is that true marco emilio giovanni maltese thats truly horrifying if so if you have a source of those statistics i would appreciate the link for it i know its bad im not denying that but i am even more disgusted if it is that bad  
ive read that cops killed more than  people in the usa in the last  years but im sorry i dont have the link you can search and you will find it easily i think usa people should be more scared of cops than of terrorists alain vosselman 
im stunned i can no longer believe this this is going to be talked about in the future if we still have one just as we talk now about stalins regime or sadam husseins or pol pot from now on even if we discover new life  triljon lightyears away traveling by megasuperfreakaliesh tech vehicles well still be the most amazing embiciles of the universe aaron beedle 
the fact that there are enough of these stories coming from america for several to be posted everyday proves how messed up the place is i would not want to be a black person living in america today i wouldnt live there at all nothing will happen to the officers they should be sentenced for murder and receive a full sentence police officers over there intruding on peoples property and killing pets killing people just walking down the street or washing their car id i was an american the only reason id want to own a gun was to defend my self against police officers ryan robbins 
you shouldnt believe everything you are reading online its bad right now but its not nearly as bad as many are making it out to be all of these innocent victims are not nearly as innocent as they are initially made out to be when the truth finally comes out on most of these stories its on page  and nobody takes the time to post it because it does not fuel there agenda to spread hate and prejudice aaron beedle 
it is true everyone has agendas im sure there are a lot of people in general dying in america but i know from life that the people with the power are usually the assholes i would say that at least  of all male human beings struggle to handle power reasonably females would be close too when it is appointed rather than earned such as when someone is called a police officer and given a weapon that can kill people with ease people tend to not handle it well i heard a while ago that some parts of the world do not use equipment they would not fire at themselves and they are made to it teaches people restraint christopher rawson 
the police across america are being demonized by a sickness in the system that wants to put us against one another that human is a human none of us our without fault or live life without ever feeling in over our headpossibly there is another way tim walker 
i suppose if everyone voted for that one independentlibertarian candidate then maybe we would have a fighting chance sadly that will never happen the vast majority of people have been brainwashed by the two main parties with the division they have created they can easily put in any candidate they choose how can anyone prove that it wasnt predetermined 
i just watched a news video of this story the mayor said the couple were passed out when police arrived police spent  minutes trying to rouse them and deescalate the situation how is there a situation to deescalate if they are passed out ?? ???? 
ryan said nowhere in his comment that they deserved what happened all he said was that another source had different information if another source has clashing info of course one of them is going to be wrong no need to bash him vanessa white 
some groups must be trying to start to a race conflict and some are just happy with anarchy i would never call them for anything they dont seem to know who or when to shoot or maybe they are all amped up on steroids all the time pitiful i will keep the children in prayer blue thugs 
all cops are cowards never seen one that wasnt a coward and bully one of the cops got tired of waiting and said gun that was all the excuse they needed to open fire what if that was a white couple with a gun in the carnearly everyone has a gun on person or in the car these days what if they have a permit or concealed carry permit do you fucking think the cops would have fired  rounds into that car and killed the white couple well do you if one of the thug cops did holler gun no one can ever say anything to contradict them cops know if only one side is left alive no one can say otherwise better to be judged by  than carried by  that is every cops motto as they know they are above the laws for mere mortal humans linda brown 
chickenshit bullies this bs has to stop i belive all you say as i have been targeted in canada first nations peopledrunk  drive teens and pot smokers are all targets where i live every skin color fair game on last two for sure these peace officers should be heald accountable face an open hearing  open to public   a fair trial  and then deal with courts decision im not sure if this happened to my friends it would not end in graveyard these murders must face charges and hopefully murder one usn veteran

arizona state constitutional provision  article  section  
the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself or the state shall not be impaired but nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize maintain or employ an armed body of men 
arizona respects the right of all us citizens to carry a concealed handgun with or without a permit or to carry openly while in this state an arizona resident permit can be obtained for the purposes of carrying concealed while in other states that offer recognition or reciprocity 
castle doctrine enacted right to carry confidentiality provisions enacted right to carry in restaurants legal right to carry laws no permit required right to carry reciprocity and recognition outright recognition right to keep  bear arms state constitutional provisions with provisions 
as such arizona has fewer crimes per capita committed with a firearm as does california how does extrapolate these facts perhaps as arizonians have come to accept firearms as a know factor in their daily lives whereas californians do not perhaps californias draconian laws encroach upon human mental health whereby inhibiting residents of the state of california to live in fear rather than confidence 
i for one shall leave this contemptuous state seeking solitude of which only a truly free society can bring i shall make arizona my final resting place i expect in this forum environment there may be egregious comments to the final resting place  
i respect all of my fellow american citizens and their constitutional right to express their opinions as protected by the united states constitutional first amendment

department of justice has statistics on police killings and being white doesnt make you immune in fact more whites were killed by police than blacks in the last  years doesnt excuse this horrible murder of an innocent couple but please dont fall prey to deluded thinking that being white makes a difference look for yourself

fuck you dude my dad is a good cop and i judge his actions too you are biased im not and leave ppl alone they never bother with flat tires so fuck off chris cochran 
every single one of these cops needs to be charged with murder and the police need to pay to make those kids end up having a good life since they will never have their parents to give them one gary harryman 
yes every cop at that scene is guilty of the same crime since they acted as a gang they should stand trial as a gang and all be charged with the same crime  murder terri spanjer 
i wish people would stop and think for a minute about how the government is allowing police to murder citizens and that over the last  years these incidents are occurring a hundred times a year its all part of the big plan to remove all your rights and terrify you  ps  yes  was an inside job think

black lives are being slaughtered even in their sleep and we sit and watch idol 
i learned at a young age the country will only change when its forced to black people need to stand up we are not shooting practice and we will raid stores court rooms and banks in the s or s if money and property is all they care about 
more may die but we all die eventually and will die sooner if we watch idol this is the world you want to live and raise your kids in really 
this is not hate talk but black lives matter marches and speeches should be the calm before the storm if they continue to kill us and our children in our sleep i dont think talking should be our last effort how many more will die 
it wont theyre killing everyone now desiree m mondesir

the entire legal system is skewed in favor of those who have money no doubt black folks are unfairly targetedabusedkilled by cops but us poor white folks get cop abuse as well but us poor whites dont seem to be killed by cops as often as black folks 
that being said i recently moved to a very rural county and the sherriffs deputies here are standup good guys they are not cowards or bullies that is one reason i moved here b alan eisen 
i wouldnt compare rural life with inner city life at all rural people respect each other they help each other the police are neighbors you can explain inner city hell to yourself ?? ?????? 
in  the police in usa murdered  black people and  white people total killed of all was  
so far in  the police in usa murdered  black people and  white people total killed so far as of february  is  
but more whites than blacks you say simple only black lives matter to the main stream media their mission is to promote an agenda to put us common folk against one another also imagine if us whites acted like blacks when we have one of our own killed by police when are whites going to loot and riot thomas headen iii 
you riot when your sports teams lose or win for that matter percentages sir say that black men are  times more likely to be killed by police than white men i think if the percentage were reversed you would be alarmed as well god bless michael mcmaster 
to put it in perspective if police were shooting people in a colourblind fashion then youd expect that for every  people shot  of them would be black and  would be white or to put it another way left handed people are about  of the population if it turned out that year after year they were  of the people killed by police it would be fair to ask why they were being singled out disproportionally anna black 
whites loot and riot during sports the real question is where is the all lives matter when this happens daniel robins one yahoocom

how does a sleeping couple put anybody into a state of fear for their lives i smell a cover up of monumental proportions by the cops involved i cant believe that they could possibly find a plausible reason to justify opening fire on these two people not only do i want to see a special grand jury called to deal with these cops police department and city i want to see a wrongful death suit brought against them the police department and the city because of these cops  children are without their parents no amount of money is going to make that better or make up for what they did 
on what planet could you possibly justify what happened smh for real

donald trump promised that he would bring millions of new republicans voters into the election but polling in swing states shows that it is hillary clinton who is getting new voters out to support her 
within their discussion of a new pennsylvania poll showing clinton leading trump by  points the new york times reported 
mrs clinton has an point lead among voters who did not participate in the  election according to our estimates which are based on a combination of the poll results and voter file data she fares even better among white voters who didnt vote in  than she does among white voters who did its a pattern that has been true across all of the upshotsiena surveys in florida north carolina and pennsylvania 
there has not been an influx of new voters who might help mr trump according to our estimates mrs clinton has a point lead among newly registered voters 
the idea that trump was bringing millions of new voters to the republican party was always a myth 
donald trump got the most votes of any candidate in a republican presidential primary trump also set the record for most votes cast against in a republican primary trump is one of the few nominees in history to have a majority of his partys primary ballots cast against him 
hillary clinton is the candidate who is attracting millions of new voters and without a doubt some of those voters have been motivated by donald trumps campaign

Kim Petersen,an eight point brief for voting to avoid corporate evil,"gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters by shooting in their heads  shares  
amateur footage emerged on saturday showing what appears to be turkish soldiers executing two female pkk insurgents at pointblank range 
almasdar news that released the footage says they are not able to independently verify it 
a ceasefire between turkey and the pkk ended last year and clashes have since claimed hundreds of lives on both sides 
the pkk operates primarily in the mountanious terrain of southeastern turkey and often uploads footage of its kurdish fighters ambushing turkish government troops more erdogan vows heavy price for coup plotters 
the tension between kurdish fighters and turkish government have always been high in past years in yet one of the most recent cases a turkish court banned the coleader of turkeys prokurdish opposition from traveling abroad as part of a court case in which she has been accused of being a member of an armed terrorist group hurriyet daily reported on saturday reuters reported 
figen yuksekdag cochair of peoples democratic party hdp is facing jail time up to  years over comments she made last year in the southeastern border town of suruc the prosecutor of the case requested the ban 
hdp described the courts decision to bar yuksekdag from foreign travel as political and arbitrary saying in a statement that it will make a formal appeal for its overturn 
the move comes days after the comayors of diyarbakir the largest city in the southeast were detained as part of a security crackdown turkeys largely kurdish southeast has been rocked by violence following the collapse of a ceasefire between the state and the kurdistan workers party pkk last year 
president tayyip erdogan has accused the hdp of being a political extension of the outlawed pkk and repeatedly called for the prosecution of its members he has also said the removal of elected officials and civil servants accused of links to the pkk was a vital part of the battle against it 
several other hdp lawmakers including cochair selahattin demirtas are also being prosecuted largely over terrorism charges after the parliament earlier this year lifted the immunity of hdp deputies along with the immunity of mps from other parties 
meanwhile three turkish soldiers were killed and five others were wounded by mortar fire from pkk militants near the southeastern town of cukurca security sources said 
soldiers who were on an operation in cukurca in hakkari province bordering iraq and iraq returned the fire sources said operations were under way to hunt down the militants

breathing  a process that goes almost unnoticed and happens on such a deep subconscious level yet it is vital for our being nowadays there are more and more cases of people breathing incorrectly 
living in a big city surrounded by constant stress pollution and technology can sometimes bring the body out of sync with the natures flow young children know how to breathe correctly on an intuitive level their body follows the rhythm of nature 
with time as the stress increases and obstacles come into our lives we quickly forget our calm manner of breathing and switch to a frantic one instead without even realizing it cancer prevention 
in  dr otto warburg received a nobel prize when he proved that cancer cells are anaerobic  this means that they cannot survive in high levels of oxygen when a body is low on oxygen some cells start to replace it by fermenting sugar a normal cell gets its energy through a process of respiration of oxygen whereas a cancer cell does it through fermentation cardiovascular health 
hypertension is all too common quite often as a result of stress in order to lower the blood pressure its important to decrease the stress levels  one of the oldest and most natural ways to do that is through deep slow breathing not only does it calm your heart beat but it allows the blood to flow at a more even pace 
research was conducted over a  year period that showed how proper breathing can prolong the lifespan  as well as increase general health the framingham study found a correlation between the vital capacity meaning the largest amount of air that can be expelled from the lungs after a deep breath and the lifespan of that person an increased vital capacity means a potentially longer lifespan cure for depression 
brain needs oxygen to work just like any other organ in the body stroke has a tendency to leave the body paralyzed as a result one of the causes is the lack of oxygen supply to the brain during a stroke this is an extreme example but looking on a smaller scale there is a connection between improper breathing and depression long periods of even a slightly limited air supply to the body caused by improper breathing can lead to a decrease in cognitive functions symptoms such brain fog forgetfulness lack of concentration and in the end depression are all interconnected increased energy levels 
have you ever told someone youre tired and in return you were told to go for a walk or do a light exercise this is because the body converts oxygen into energy through a process called cellular respiration  when you inhale the air correctly more of it gets to your body thus increasing the energy levels through conversion it is also one of the reasons why people who exercise on a regular basis are generally more energetic than those with sedentary lifestyles different breathing techniques 
there is a countless number of breathing techniques for different purposes and each one of them has its own benefits breathing exercises can lower or raise blood pressure improve sleep help with anxiety and much more 
yoga is one of the practices that incorporates breathing exercises called pranayama as an essential part of the process coming from the east its uncertain when exactly yoga originated but there is evidence that it has been around for at least  years  yogic breathing techniques have been applied for thousands of years making them timeproof i will share with you a couple of my favorite breathing techniques that i personally use in different situations best body detoxifier 
kapalbhati is a breathing technique that detoxifies your body opens up your nasal passages and allows your mind to concentrate after doing the exercise you will feel a rush of energy that will immediately wake you up 
instructions sit comfortably with a straight spine place your left hand on the knee with the palm facing upwards and your right hand on the stomach take a deep breath quickly exhale while exhaling pull the stomach in as if youre trying to touch the back and do it to an extent that feels comfortable however do not apply strength or pressure beyond the level of comfort  repetitions per set come back to normal breathing after each set and observe your bodys sensations its advised to do  repetitions daily sleeping and stress reducing technique 
its a simple slow breathing  exercise that helps you fall asleep faster or calm down during an anxiety attack all you have to do is fully exhale through your mouth with a sound whoosh with a closed mouth slowly inhale with your nose on a count of four hold your breath for seven seconds exhale fully through your mouth on a count of eight  making a whoosh sound repeat until you feel sleepy or calm",legorafi.fr,Fake,english,16.684927674847486,47.88118811881188,79,10,4770,819,4.78998778998779,819.0,0.5210227097491011,-0.0141271790859303,0.4739014244944421,0.5059757156353089,-0.2952162177325784,0.529402648510146,0.0012210012210012,0.0,0.0012210012210012,0,0,0.0,0.0021621032630209,0.9725,0.115,0.092,0.793,Positive,Very Strong

the march   correspondence was posted by wikileaks after the email was ostensibly captured in john podestas hacked gmail account 
the message was a response to a suggestion from clintons communications director jennifer palmieri that clinton make a joke about the email fiasco during a charity dinner later that day this was two months before the state department publicly released the first batch of clintons emails messages which had previously been provided to the house select committee on benghazi

margolis and i discussed replied mandy grunwald a communications adviser to clinton we dont know whats in the emails so we are nervous about this might get a big laugh tonight and regret it when content of emails is disclosed 
thats when reines chimed in with his remarks 
trust me most of the email themselves are funnier than any joke we can come up with read in total by america she would either win  states or lose  states i go back and forth 
im not hard over either way but i would not make a joke just for the sake of making a joke because email retention  benghazi

No Author,secret talks between mozambique opposition eu mediators canceled,"interviews us first lady michelle obama l listens as democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton speaks during a campaign rally in winstonsalem north carolina on october   photo by afp 
the united states government is trying to distract people from the true nature of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton by accusing russia of influencing the election against her 
don debar a new yorkbased author and radio host made the remarks in an interview with press tv on thursday following russian president vladimir putins response to washingtons accusations of sponsoring hacking attacks against the us 
speaking to foreign policy experts during a valdai discussion club meeting in sochi southern russia on thursday putin said washington was using russia as a distraction to cover the fact that this years white house contenders had nothing to offer on real issues 
the subject matter of what is being revealed here is definitely an action item that defines who clinton is debar said 
also the thing that is really galling is the fact that we are told to ignore the content and the content is something that goes to the heart of governing and also to the heart of clintons record the analyst noted 
this is the person who was married to the guy who signed in three strikes and you are out legislation for people to get life in prison if they are convicted of three felonies he said if you look at the things that have been revealed here some of the acts are themselves the violations of three separate federal criminal sanctions 
debar argued that clinton has multiple sets of the triple violations and yet is freely allowed to run for office under federal protection 
clinton and her campaign have repeatedly claimed that russia was trying to rig the november election in favor of republican nominee donald trump 
during the last presidential debate last week clinton accused trump of having secret ties with moscow saying that putin would love to see a puppet in the white house 
debar dismissed accusations against the russian president but noted that since the us was openly seeking regime change in russia it is only logical for russia to fight back 
based on that argument debar said it warrants support and not condemnation even if russia was trying to fight back in a way or another loading",presstv.ir,Real,english,99.2,47.88118811881188,64,8,2309,388,4.920103092783505,388.0,0.062397119602861,-0.3899286096724409,-0.1772094541901232,-0.1696947048821885,-0.1668051743657725,-0.1620646813919597,0.0025773195876288,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0038919496149318,-0.908,0.05,0.095,0.855,Negative,Very Strong
Frontpagemag.com,freedom center urges college presidents to end aid to campus supporters of terror,"search selective outrage over splcs antimuslim extremist list leftists and atheists appalled that splcs hit list of islam critics includesleftists and atheists october   robert spencer 
sam harris thinks its unbelievable that maajid nawaz and ayaan hirsi ali made it to the southern poverty law centers hit list of antimuslim extremists he said nothing about me or the other people whom the splc included which is not surprising since he has quite recently expressed willingness to acquiesce in other contexts to the demonization that the splc list exemplifies 
hemant mehta of the friendly atheist blog ably sums up the outrage over nawaz and hirsi ali being included if criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists then it wont be long before other vocal atheists end up on that list too and make no mistake thats what nawaz and hirsi ali are doing thats all theyre doing theyre not antimuslim they work with moderate muslims theyre critical of the worst aspects of islam 
the problem with being angry about nawaz and hirsi ali being on the splc list but silent about everyone else who is on it is that what mehta says about nawaz and hirsi ali can quite accurately said about everyone else on the list if criticizing religious beliefs makes them extremists then it wont be long before everyone who dares to utter a critical word about islam will be on the list  and that is indeed the objective of the list to stigmatize and marginalize any and all such critics mehta protests that nawaz and hirsi ali are not antimuslim they work with moderate muslims theyre critical of the worst aspects of islam 
but no one would think that the other  were antimuslim if it hadnt been for the southern poverty law center and the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair and their allied groups insisting that we were all these years in their avidity to conflate opposition to jihad terror and sharia oppression with hating a group of people  a tactic designed to discredit opposition to jihad terror and sharia oppression mehta and co are falling for and validating the same smear tactics hey are decrying when used against their friends 
and as for working with moderate muslims for  years jihad watch has contained this invitation  any muslim who renounces violent jihad and dhimmitude is welcome to join in our antijihadist efforts it is nawaz as well as other moderates who has attacked me in what appears to have been a cynical attempt to gain support for himself among muslims i never attacked him and would have have been happy to work with him otherwise 
in complaining that nawaz and hirsi ali are merely criticizing religious beliefs and are not antimuslim mehta is strongly implying that the others on the splc list are doing something beyond criticizing religious beliefs and are indeed antimuslim on twitter the last couple of days ive seen many people express outrage that nawaz has been lumped in with the likes of spencer but when i ask them what the big difference is between us or for quotes from me that are actually bigoted they go silent 
mehta harris haider and the others who are only angry with the splcs hit list because it included nawaz and hirsi ali are by their selective outrage acquiescing to and legitimizing the splcs demonization of the other people on the list in his own defense hemant mehta wrote me to explain somewhat unsatisfactorily i focused on those two because theyre well known in atheist circles this is a selfdefeating choice for them to have made for the splc has never identified anyone whom it considers to be a legitimate critic of islam and never will the point of lists such as the one they released yesterday is to demonize and silence everyone who dares say something about islam that is not warmly positive 
the turn of mehta harris and haider will come for the same treatment one wonders if when this happens there will be anyone left to speak for them who has not already been smeared as antimuslim with their tacit approval",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,82.22642928926737,81,13,3992,685,4.807299270072993,685.0,0.5821727884352664,0.5495749667938356,0.2680646656091955,0.2959064897667598,-0.2781314846366201,0.3144220865452222,0.0131386861313868,0.0,0.0043795620437956,0,5,0.0,0.028039703980776,-0.9961,0.067,0.15,0.783,Negative,Very Strong

daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
september   has come and gone countless bodies lie scattered in fragments around where two of the countrys tallest skyscrapers once stood some have burned to ash others had their throats slashed by islamic terrorists still others fought and died on a plane to prevent another islamic terror attack from taking place 
but joe has an idea joe is a guy with lots of big ideas and this one is a real doozy 
the senator from delaware has come a long way since his days as a sixties shyster drumming up business in wilmington his formerly bald head is covered in hair so shiny is gleams under neon lights his teeth are capped and shine almost as brightly after a generation holding down a squeaky seat in the senate seniority makes him a man to be reckoned with and therefore a man to be listened to 
even if you wish he would shut up 
im groping here joe says for once he isnt referring to his notorious habits with women that will go on to make him the star of countless viral photographs massaging squeezing caressing instead hes talking about foreign policy the chair of the senate foreign relations committee has no clue 
joe is worried that the muslims will think badly of us after they murdered thousands of us and he has a plan to make them feel better 
seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for  million to iran senator joe biden says 
the remark isnt quite as random as it seems the senator from delaware a state not known for its large muslim or iranian population has a friendly relationship with the iran lobby that relationship will only grow friendlier during the bush era as he attacks america and appeases its enemies 
iranianamericans who hate the jihadist government that has taken over their country and oppressed the persian people are outraged when he attends a fundraiser at a proiranian lobbyists home in california while treasonously attacking his own government for naming iran one of the members of the axis of evil 
joes usual amtrak obsession wouldnt get him in the door in california but treason hair plugs and capped teeth make him a big hit outside delaware and joe remains very fond of iran 
he informs israeli officials that israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of iran and thats all the way back in  before the deal that puts iran on the path to a shiite bomb was a nuclear twinkle in obamas eye and a radioactive itch in hillarys socks 
that was a big year for biden it was his first and biggest shot at the big chair in the white house joe had tried it in  and was stomped by dukakis of all people after being caught plagiarizing a speech by british politician neil kinnock  got him a useless position in the white house as a consolation prize 
this time around joe biden is expected to get the same consolation prize from hillary clinton that she got from barack obama the office of secretary of state of the united states 
of all the jobs that joe biden wants and is utterly unfit for amtrak train engineer secret agent and the guy in charge of counting all the money at the bar its hard to think of one that hes less fit for 
joe biden blamed darfur on the gingrich revolution he fell in love with the taliban 
the taliban per se is not our enemy joe insisted there is not a single statement that the president has ever made in any of our policy assertions that the taliban is our enemy 
he suggested that  of the taliban were probably okay and only  were incorrigible most of the taliban he seemed to think were like joe biden just in it for the money 
but joe biden has a soft spot for islamic terrorists whether theyre the shiite jihadists of iran or the sunni jihadists of the taliban joe loves all the terrorists of the world and the terrorists love him back 
it wasnt that long ago that we were being lectured to by the media on bushs ruination of relations with the rest of the world if biden were to become secretary of state he would become the third democratic presidential campaign loser to get the job as a consolation prize for his failures as a politician the last time a professional held down the job would have been the bush administration 
and yet perversely each loser secretary has been more incompetent than the last hillarys disastrous time as secretary of state could only be exceeded by john kerry who gave away everything to the russians and who was contradicted by the white house so many times it would have humiliated a lesser man or just any man the only loser who could follow two class acts like that was joe biden 
joe bidens amateur diplomacy has been one disaster after another even his visit to israel a friendly ally not known for fractious political visits by american politicians became an international incident with biden sulking in his room while hillary yelled at prime minister netanyahu for  minutes over the phone but somehow biden with his gift for appeasing iran and the taliban alienates allies 
just this year joe biden launched yet another attack on israel a cynic might almost think that tehran joe loves islamic terrorists and hates those who resist them and fight against them 
biden has claimed that terrorism is not an existential threat he accused president bush of being shortsighted for using the military to fight islamic terrorists he argued that the perception that we want to stay in iraq helps al qaeda some years later his administrations decision to pull out led to the rise of isis he called for closing gitmo while insisting that it had become the greatest propaganda tool that exists for recruiting of terrorists around the world 
senator joe biden was a voice for appeasement vice president joe biden was part of an administration that empowered and unleashed the malignant power of islamic terror secretary of state joe biden would be able to act out his worst fantasies he could even write that check to iran though the obamabiden era has seen cash transfers to iran that make joes  million check seem like chump change

the major problem with airbnbs new nondiscrimination provisions is that they really just represent an euphemismbowing to a customers feelings rather than proven discrimination the overall framework of the companys policy alterations assumes that those accommodation providers accused of discrimination are actually guilty of it this rush to judgment gives little or no recourse to those who depend on airbnb to generate an income it also makes it very easy for certain protected groups most notably transgender people to falsely or very loosely claim discrimination when in fact the issue is likely to be the prospective guests temperament or perceived reliability in respecting the property 
secondly the policy changes ignore the unique nature of sharing economy sites like airbnb accommodation providers are often accepting guests into their literal homes or their sole investment property whereas hotels have roundtheclock staff including security airbnb properties are much more informal and unsupervised providers therefore have good reasons to be very judicious about who exactly they let into their residences airbnbs open doors policy treats any discrimination complaint as gospel truth brian chesky mustve drank the same poisoned water as fellow tech sjw jack dorsey of twitter 
well be implementing a new policy called open doors starting october st if a guest anywhere in the world feels like they have been discriminated against in violation of our policy  in trying to book a listing having a booking canceled or in any other interaction with a host  we will find that guest a similar place to stay if one is available on airbnb or if not we will find them an alternative accommodation elsewhere 
 brian chesky airbnb ceo and cofounder 
in addition to dictating what kinds of guests can enter their providers properties another one of airbnbs new policies which is already in force treats those accused of discrimination as immediately guilty rather than determining whether discrimination has occurred airbnb has made it clear that it will bend over backwards to find those claiming discrimination other accommodation within its network or more strangely still alternative accommodation outside its network the second arm of this discrimination response will become very interesting indeed should privatelyowned airbnb decide to go public it is hard to see how shareholders would acquiesce to a company offering customers thirdparty accommodation options that effectively deprive it of money 
airbnb is simply trying to have its cake and eat it too on the one hand it wants to create as wide a market for itself as possible now having providers offering  listings in  cities around the world on the other hand however it wants to assume total control for determining what is and what is not discrimination despite having no ability to verify pretty much any of the accusations airbnb are mere gatekeepers providing a rudimentary service that makes its bucks by the sheer volume of providers these same providers should not suffer because of the companys thinlyspread business model allegations of discrimination have been scant at best we dont question the right of people to be selective about new housemates so why not airbnb providers and their guests 
various news articles reporting on the shift in airbnb policies have only been able to point to isolated instances of even alleged  let alone proven discrimination the best that sjw enablers can offer is a deeply flawed harvard study which claimed that prospective guests with stereotypical africanamerican names like latoya and darnell were  percent less likely to be approved by the companys accommodation providers considering that a guests profile provides a lot more information than just their name the harvard research leaves a lot to be desired 
moreover names like cletus and marysue would arguably garner even less approvals both these white names and the aforementioned africanamerican names usually dovetail with some of americas least sophisticated and worldly types the exact kinds of people least likely to be allowed into someones home it has precious little to do with race and almost everything to do with runofthemill decisions about how to safeguard ones own property by entrusting it to the right people such decisions are routinely accepted when new housemates are sought so why not with airbnb has airbnb signed its own execution order  bookingcom is better than airbnb  cheaper prices always instant booking tons of apartment listings better interface and no sjw crap 
 roosh rooshv october   
just as roosh swears by bookingcom there are plenty of other options you can take in avoiding airbnb from now on like twitter the company is quickly falling under the spell of the sjw crowd it seems certain that minus a backtrack airbnb and its reputation will follow jack dorseys company into the abyss unlike twitter though airbnb may never make the jump to publiclylisted company

Rosemary Hansen,reasons to try acupuncture for baby eczema,"bloomberg reported  
to compensate for this trumps campaign has devised another strategy which not surprisingly is negative instead of expanding the electorate bannon and his team are trying to shrink it we have three major voter suppression operations under way says a senior official theyre aimed at three groups clinton needs to win overwhelmingly idealistic white liberals young women and african americans trumps invocation at the debate of clintons wikileaks emails and support for the transpacific partnership was designed to turn off sanders supporters the parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by bill clinton and harassed or threatened by hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women and her  suggestion that some african american males are super predators is the basis of a belowtheradar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the pollsparticularly in florida 
the effort was obvious and according to the polling it is failing 
voter turnout among young women is expected to rise according to the latest harvard iop young voters poll sanders started flocking towards clinton in august  and havent left and early voting statistics show that africanamerican turnout is solid in swing states 
the trump campaign has realized that they dont have enough supporters to win so they are adopting tactics that run contrary to the heart of democracy to shrink the electorate in critical states 
however for voter suppression efforts like trumps to be effective the campaign must have a credible messenger donald trump is not a credible messenger to any of the voters that he is trying to deter and he has no effective surrogates that are capable of delivering his message 
a voter suppression effort was expected from the trump campaign what is unexpected is that the campaign would publicly brag about it

taking states that the media has tried to downplay as if trump has no chance to win them dml shows how trump not only has a chance but predicts he will win these states and he backs up his prediction with solid data and facts 
dml also clarified that the polls are extremely misleading he said trump has lit a spark in people who have not voted in decades  some who have never voted  but now they are embracing trump these people are not being included in the polls 
early voting is also not a true representation of whats about to happen because more democrats tend to show up for early voting while the majority of republicans wait until election day

Henry Wolff,obsessing over europes refugee crisis while ignoring africas is white privilege at work,"loading posted on november   putin condemns europes handling of migrants and says the child rape in austria shows a dilution of national values jennifer newton daily mail november   
vladimir putin has waded into the migrant crisis condemning europes handling of asylum seekers and saying a case of child rape in austria dilutes national values 
the russian president has largely kept quiet over the refugee crisis in europe but has now spoken out of his disbelief over its handling claiming that a continent that cant protect its children has no future 
his comments come off the back of a case in austria last week which saw an iraqi migrant have his conviction of raping a yearold boy at a swimming pool in vienna overturned 
he was originally convicted of the crime but it was overturned because a court didnt prove he realised the boy was saying no 
it came after the migrant identified as yearold amir a claimed that it was a sexual emergency because he had not had sex for four months 
a second trial for the rape is expected to take place next year but the attacker is likely to remain in custody until then 
and speaking at a press conference this week putin slammed europes migration policy and cited the case where the victim was from a serbian family living in austria 
he said in a european country a child is raped by a migrant and the court releases him 
it doesnt fit into my head what on earth theyre thinking over there 
i cant even explain the rationaleis it a sense of guilt before the migrants whats going on its not clear 
he also claimed that the case highlighted the dissolution of traditional national values adding a society that cannot defend its children has no future 
and putins words appeared to have struck a chord as he is extremely popular with serbs 
in the rape case the boy had arrived in austria with his serbian mother who paid for him to go to the theresienbad swimming pool where he was violently attacked 
the boy was so badly injured that he needed hospital treatment but he will be forced to go back to court for the iraqi mans second trial outraging the austrian serbian community 
austrian media say the case has hardened the communities position against asylum seekers who were previously divided about whether to vote for the leftleaning green party candidate or the far right option nobert hofer in upcoming elections 
however it is not the first time russia has lashed out at the eus handling of the migrant crisis 
in march konstantin romodanovsky head of russias federal migration service accused leaders of willfully ignoring cultural differences that have caused such widespread friction and chaos across the continent 
he also added that multiculturalism has failed because europe never formed a unified strategy to integrate refugees into western society 
he said the european commission left it up to individual nations to decide how they want to treat asylum seekersdespite the fact the policies and capabilities of member states are very different 
romodanovsky also accused eu countries of ignoring the differences in culture religious traditions and customs with the refugees the vast majority of whom are islamic",amren.com,Fake,english,16.093066489392562,11.326876277819148,87,13,3174,538,4.856877323420075,538.0,0.7656230244937624,0.5495749667938356,0.0516450399432164,0.0654574136273813,-0.2292028081350613,0.0785852014045968,0.0111524163568773,0.0769230769230769,0.0018587360594795,1,4,0.1736638992171942,0.0245143224353236,-0.999,0.032,0.213,0.756,Negative,Very Strong

DL,comment on hillary is so unpopular she has to pay off youth voters and fabricate her rallies by dl,"the american medical association defines an alcoholic as someone who has a prolonged period of frequent heavy alcohol use is unable to control drinking once it has begun has withdrawal symptoms when the individual stops using alcohol needs to use more and more alcohol to achieve the same effects has a variety of social andor legal problems arising from alcohol use 
by that definition hillary clinton is an alcoholic  exhibit a 
in an email to hillarys campaign chairman john podesta on august   director of communications for hillarys campaign jennifer palmieri wrote referring to hillary 
i think you should call her and sober her up some 
heres a screenshot of the email released by wikileaks  exhibit b 
on feb   hillarys spokesman nick merrill sent an email presumably to hillarys campaign staff with the subject hrc clips news clips on hillary rodham clinton the news clips that day included an article by benjamin bell for abc news titled one thing that might surprise you about hillary clinton which merrill reproduced in its entirety in his email 
bells article was an interview with new york times national political reporter amy chozick on whether hillary clinton would announce shes running for the presidency one of the questions bell asked chozick was covering hillary clinton what is one thing that has surprised you about her 
chozick answered 
hmm she likes to drink we were on the campaign trail in  and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in pennsylvania um no 
heres a composite screenshot of the relevant part of merrills email from wikileaks  exhibit c 
according to the national enquirer  top staffers of hillarys campaign told the enquirer they even began this years presidential campaign by secretly planning a stint in rehab for hillary but any rehab therapy quickly failed amid the pressures of the campaign and the effort of making a deal over an fbi probe into her email scandal 
a source said the stress of her political career the neverending scandals and her worsening health plunged her into a lifethreatening booze hell she turned to drink to drown her fears hillary tries to hide her problem like she lies about so many things a close friend of hillary added  hillary has been drinking heavily for years to forget her miserable marriage to serial cheater bill shes also hit the bottle to cope with other stress as well as the boredom of flying all over the world when she was secretary of state 
one hillary insider told the enquirer that hillary has blackouts and wakes up wondering where she is and what she has done  and that shes not fit to be president 
certainly hillary must be drunk when she obscenely ground against the twerking black woman see below because no sane person in her then position as us secretary of state would behave like this in public

democratic vice president joe biden wants american women to get back in the workforce to help boost the economy if we just put all the women back to work if they were able to afford childcare we would increase the gdp in america by close to eight tenths of one percent he said thats trillions of dollars over the next decade 
biden made his remarks during a campaign event for hillary clinton at chatham university in pittsburgh pennsylvania on tuesday the state of our economy could be characterized by a single word pitiful he argued were still battling recession i dont care what the official stats are saying america is still in recession and were not doing anything about it 
he added that it was lazy american women who brought about the downfall of the economy because they sit around on their behinds doing nothing and squandering their days away when they could be improving the country that has given so much to them im not sure how exactly we got to this point but were here and we need to move like yesterday he said 
mark my words and mark them well he addressed the crowd hillary clinton is the only one who can force american women to go to work this is true because of a number of reasons first shes a woman herself and not just any woman shes a selfmade woman so you better believe what shes saying is true and has been tried and tested in practice plenty of times 
second hillary clinton understands how difficult it can be to give up the status of a freeloader when your husband is the breadwinner of the household and the wife is expected to tend to the house the children make sure dinner is served and always be in the mood for marital duties shes been all that and shes learned how to break free from it the hard way i might add biden continued 
todays women are pampered and arent used to rolling up their sleeves and getting the job done on their own the vice president said theyre too dependent too weak and too lazy to contribute to the economy the reason for that is theyve learned how to manipulate men by employing one of the most fundamental laws of economics when a soughtafter commodity becomes short in supply the demand for it rises even higher 
now thats all fine and dandy when it comes to their personal interests but if you look at the big picture its the economy thats missing out on valuable workforce and thats why we need to get them off their lazy behinds and get them into their workplaces and like i said hillary clinton is the only one who can do it which is what makes her the ideal candidate for the next president of the united states we need to heal this country folks not run it into the ground even deeper biden concluded",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,70,12,2682,497,4.382293762575452,497.0,0.245847355661357,0.3616742515005802,-0.0785242214597929,0.0011825012347656,-0.6975702399695177,0.012807566773538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9561,0.094,0.071,0.835,Positive,Very Strong

the complaints noted that the machines wrongly identified a voters choice but in all reported cases the voters were able to correct their ballots before casting them 
to my knowledge at this point we dont have any cases where elections officials noted significant problems with any machines based on these complaints of course theyre all looked into and thats why we encourage people to immediately flag down an election official commented gannon 
the nc state board of election released the following statement regarding the complaints 
the nc state board of elections is aware that some voters have contacted advocacy groups or elections officials with concerns about touchscreen voting machines in several counties 
similar reports have been made in recent elections and we take them very seriously 
we want to ensure voters that safeguards are in place to ensure touchscreen machines accurately record voters selections 
touchscreen machines are tested thoroughly before each election they are recalibrated daily before voting begins to test and ensure accuracy if a voter notices an issue with selection accuracy of a machine they should raise their hand and notify an election official immediately if needed the machine may be taken out of service for recalibration and the voter may be moved to a different machine 
also each touchscreen machine prompts voters to review their selections before casting their ballot as with paper ballots voters should check over their selections to ensure accuracy prior to casting their ballot on touchscreen machines voters also can review a realtime audit log that records all of their selections 
we urge all voters to carefully review their selections before casting their ballots and to immediately report any questions or concerns to elections officials said kim westbrook strach executive director of the nc state board of elections",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,101,18,1901,296,5.39527027027027,296.0,1.19367357529692,1.489078543260112,-0.2851546953535945,-0.313921337568058,0.3021382298588139,-0.3096632761738477,0.0101351351351351,0.0,0.0101351351351351,0,0,0.0,0.0179469179636569,0.9456,0.097,0.047,0.857,Positive,Very Strong

parents who plan on refinancing their homes in order to send their children off to college should instead consider encouraging them to specialize in a trade 
speaking as a phd in philosophy who has spent the last  years teaching at the college level im perhaps the last person from whom advice of this sort is expected but it is precisely because of my familiarity with academia that i beseech the college bound and their enablersi mean their supportersto revisit their plans 
whether one regards a postsecondary institution as a means to either a remunerative profession or a genuine education the tragic fact of the matter is that the contemporary academic world is about as politicized a cultural institution as any more specifically it is a bastion of political correctness a decidedly leftist ideology that tolerates no competition 
for the last  years professor duke pesta who is currently an associate professor of english at the university of wisconsin oshkosh has taught literature at a range of colleges at the outset of each semester he would quiz his students on their knowledge of american and western history what he found is that the overwhelming number of them believed that slaveryan institution mind you that is as old as humanity itself was practiced in virtually every society the planet over and that lasted only some  years in the united states was an exclusively american phenomenon  
most of my students could not tell me anything meaningful about slavery outside of america pesta told the college fix his students are convinced that slavery was an american problem that more or less ended with the civil war and they are very fuzzy about slavery prior to the colonial era 
their entire education about slavery he adds was confined to america 
yet it isnt just students who display an astonishing ignorance of slavery over at boston university saida grundy  an assistant professor of sociology and africanamerican studies tweeted that slavery is a white peoplething 
grundy didnt stop there she asks is white peoples new deflection from dealing with slavery that all races have had slaves thing is this the new alllivesmatter 
professor grundy added other enlightening tweets 
for the record no race outside of europeans had a system that made slavery a personhood instead of temporary condition 
there is also no race except europeans who kidnapped and transported human beings in order to enslave them and their offspring for life 
before europeans invented it as such slavery was not a condition that was de facto inherited from parent to child 
in case white folks couldnt follow the thrust of her rant grundy offers a summation of her sophisticated position 
in other words deal with your white sht white people slavery is a yall thing 
in addition to assigning blame for slavery solely to white europeans grundy claimed that white masculinity is the problem for americas colleges 
over at the university of pittsburgh students who were distributing prodonald trump materials were harassed and attacked  the trump supporters were accused of backing a racist candidate who espouses hate speech they were greeted by chants of fk the white male patriarchy and eventually physical aggression 
one of the victims said that my campus shouldnt be a place where my friends and i are fearful for having opposing opinions 
these students were accosted by other students students elsewhere however have had professors with which to contend 
at the university of california at los angeles ucla a political science professor michael chwe wrote in a blog post for princeton university press that the danger to democracy itself is posed by trump supporters this danger is real and must be confronted chwe maintains that trump and his supporters are the greatest danger to democracy since world war ii even perhaps since the civil war 
chwe thinks that had we done a better and earlier job with confronting as opposed to accommodating white and male privilegewe might not have reached this situation the trump phenomenon we must set our sights on combatting these forms of privilege now though if we hope to divert democracy away from selfdestruction 
and it isnt just faculty in the humanities and liberal arts that cant resist injecting their politics into the classroom a math professor at mount holyoke college an allfemale school was recently captured on video launching into an antitrumpproclinton tirade in class while he never referred to either candidate by name peter rosnicks choice for president was plain this election rosnick said is the scariest that hes ever witnessed he told his students that they should vote for someone who thinks women are full and capable and responsible and intelligent beings who should not be the object of um should not be objectified 
rosnick also prescribed his students to vote for whoever you want but vote for somebody who respects the fact that this is a country built on immigrantsthat this is a country that couldnt that wouldnt be what it is if it wasnt for bringing immigrants into our nation and respecting them and respecting what they bring to our country 
at least one of rosnicks students was less than enthused over his proselytizing efforts speaking on condition of anonymity this student told the college fix that she found it highly inappropriate for a math teacher to use my class time to try to tell me who to vote for

Jason Easley,gop scandal falls apart as new emails didnt come from hillary clintons server,"by rmuse    am the voter suppression tactic is right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in north carolina   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
some americans are likely aware of the psychological term projecting that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone else as an unconscious form of transferring guilt for ones own actions as soon as the republican primaries concluded donald trump projected republicans guilt for election rigging either through vote obstruction or suppression onto democrats and his opponent hillary clinton republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of barack obama in  and they have only ramped up their  election rigging activities over the past eight years and yet trump accuses democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath 
yesterday the north carolina conference of the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp filed a lawsuit against north carolina republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the  coordinated effort to suppress the black vote in the state  what the naacp rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was  right out of the gop election rigging playbook to suppress the black vote in the state  
the election rigging amounts to three counties in north carolina canceling voter registration of thousands of mostly african american democratic residents a week before the presidential election the lawsuit charged election officials in beaufort moore and cumberland counties of denying primarily african american voters eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were  bounced back as undeliverable  
most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for purging such as james edward arthur sr had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots many of the purged voters lived at their  original registration address  and were victims of a  simple postal service error  
mr arthur is an african american who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last  elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue arthur testified that he like thousands of other african american democratic voters never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was denied or that if he didnt attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy mr arthur said 
 if i knew my right to vote was in jeopardy i would do whatever i could to protect it i want and plan to vote in the upcoming election but i am concerned that since my registration has been canceled i will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted  
it is what any sane human being would consider  election rigging  simply because the tricounty ploy targeted primarily african americans who typically vote for democrats it is also something north carolina republicans have been guilty of for the past six years 
according to the naacp lawsuit north carolina republicans are in violation of the national voter registration act which  bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final  days before an election  republican election officials state officials defended their  election rigging  and said they were justified in  purging tensofthousands  of mainly african american democratic voters eligibility the definition of systemic on an individual basis 
however the naacp also accused republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly african american voters eligibility who did not receive the mailing one republican who ran for a local office last year shane hubers challenged the registration of voters?the majority who are them democrats ?in beaufort county 
in one of the other counties charged in the lawsuit cumberland county one  individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of  mostly democratic voters  in moore county the secretary of the local republican party n carol wheeldon challenged approximately  mainly african american registered voters likely because they do not vote for republicans 
the lead attorney for the naacps lawsuit penda hair said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted republican  election rigging  conspiracy 
 we know that in two of the counties the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local republican party we also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties  ms hair also noted that  in moore county the return address of a rightwing group called the voter integrity project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters this is a very pernicious treatment of voters  she said it is also a deliberate act of  election rigging  by republicans 
the president of the north carolina naacp reverend dr william barber said 
 we are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in north carolina that weve seen since the days of jim crow the tar heel state is ground zero in the intentional surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters these attempts are a direct affront to our constitution  
the naacp lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since  using this election rigging  process back on the rolls immediately the organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible voters and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on election day they have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case 
it might be the case that the naacps request for a hearing may be granted especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that north carolina republicans violated the national voter registration act in yet another manner failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a dmv office over the past few years 
last thursday us district court judge loretta biggs ordered north carolina republicans to permit those tensofthousands of voters to cast provisional ballots it is highly doubtful that north carolina republicans will obey the federal judges orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their election rigging actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters 
republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the american people first elected barack obama as president and the conservatives on the supreme court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with republicans to suppress or obstruct the voting rights of primarily people of color because they dont support republicans to be perfectly clear it is irrelevant if it is called voter suppression obstruction or disenfranchisement it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections and it is only republicans and the koch brothers outfit the american legislative exchange council alec who are behind each and every attempt in republicancontrolled states to kill democracy by doing what the republican party standard bearer donald trump is guilty of projecting rig elections",politicususa.com,Real,english,100.0,92.2978201200483,77,13,7327,1177,5.166383701188455,392.3333333333333,0.4598726310629357,0.5495749667938356,1.1504111834527655,1.067205438478149,0.0762496332300994,-0.1551125736667258,0.0016992353440951,0.0769230769230769,0.0016992353440951,1,0,0.1736638992171942,0.0030089423490469,-0.9941,0.043,0.089,0.868,Negative,Very Strong

the nras magazine acknowledged that president obama really hasnt had the opportunity to confiscate firearms undercutting years of fearmongering about the supposed existence of a  massive obama conspiracy  to dismantle the second amendment and take guns away 
the nras admission that a president cant confiscate guns because congress writes the laws not the president also demonstrates the implausibility of repeated recent claims from the nra that link hillary clinton to gun confiscation 
the admission was included in a june  article for nra magazine americas st freedom which took issue with how obama rudely responded to a question from a gun store owner at a recent town hall event 
the article quoted obama as telling the questioner im about to leave office there have been more guns sold since ive been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it is just not true 
responding to obamas statement the article acknowledged now the gun store ownercould have interrupted the president to mention that obama really hasnt had the opportunity to do that congress writes the laws not the president 
rhude didnt sit down after asking his question rather he stood silently as president obama didnt even try to answer his question but instead went off on a defensive tirade first of all the notion that i or hillary or democrats or whoever you want to choose are hellbent on taking away folks guns is just not true and i dont care how many times the nra says it 
obama then said im about to leave office there have been more guns sold since ive been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it is just not true 
now rhude could have interrupted the president to mention that obama really hasnt had the opportunity to do that congress writes the laws not the president he could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms  from operation fast and furious to operation choke point to obamas attempted ban on common ammunition for artype rifles to his using a pen and phone to push antigun executive actions but rhude respectfully stayed silent 
claims about gun confiscation and obama have been the nras bread and butter for the past eight years  more recently the nra has suggested that the election of clinton could lead to gun confiscation for lawabiding americans

red voltaire  ciudad de méxico méxico   de octubre de  français ??????? italiano el  y  de octubre se llevó a cabo en el estado de goa india la octava cumbre de los brics acrónimo de brasil rusia india china y sudáfrica hay que reconocer que el encuentro se desarrolló en medio de una situación profundamente crítica para la economía mundial sin embargo los brics pusieron de manifiesto una vez más su extraordinaria capacidad para transformar un mal momento en una oportunidad para profundizar los vínculos entre ellos desde una perspectiva estratégica
después de que las economías de los brics gozaran de una época dorada en los últimos años sus tasas de crecimiento han sufrido una drástica desaceleración frente a esta difícil coyuntura hoy más que nunca los brics necesitan echar mano de las instituciones financieras que presentaron ante el mundo hace un par de años en fortaleza brasil durante su sexta cumbre   
en abril pasado su nuevo banco de desarrollo realizó sus primeros préstamos    por más de  millones de dólares y para  se calcula que los créditos otorgados podrían alcanzar los   millones de dólares    asimismo esta entidad financiera llevó a cabo en julio de este año una histórica emisión de bonos verdes green bonds en yuanes por un monto equivalente a  millones de dólares    estos títulos financieros a la vez que incrementan la influencia de la moneda china a escala mundial sirven para el financiamiento de grandes proyectos de inversión
por su parte el acuerdo contingente de reservas cra por sus siglas en inglés dotado de   millones de dólares ya está listo para otorgar sus primeras líneas de crédito con el objetivo de estabilizar las balanzas de pagos de los brics según anunció el ministro de finanzas de la india arun jaitley    toda vez que la reserva federal fed de estados unidos amaga permanentemente con subir la tasa de interés de los fondos federales federal funds rate y con ello detonar una nueva turbulencia financiera mundial urge que los brics incrementen cuanto antes los recursos monetarios de su fondo de estabilización pues de lo contrario corren el riesgo de padecer serios estragos por las apuestas especulativas de los grandes bancos de inversiones
de forma simultánea los brics necesitan abrir nuevos frentes de batalla que desafíen de modo abierto la hegemonía de estados unidos y el dólar en el sistema financiero mundial    no solamente a través de los intercambios comerciales en monedas locales sino por ejemplo a través de la acumulación de reservas en yuanes entre sus bancos centrales más todavía luego de que la moneda del pueblo renminbi en chino ingresó oficialmente el pasado º de octubre en los derechos especiales de giro special drawing rights la canasta de divisas de élite creada por el fondo monetario internacional fmi a finales de la década de los    
por añadidura los brics tienen la capacidad de articular una gran alianza financiera con poderosos eslabonamientos geopolíticos entre américa latina asia áfrica y el medio oriente los bancos regionales de desarrollo que están conformados en su mayoría por los países periféricos bien pueden servir a este objetivo el banco asiático de inversiones en infraestructura aiib por sus siglas en inglés el banco del alba alianza bolivariana para los pueblos de nuestra américa e incluso el banco del sur que finalmente arrancará antes de que termine este año
asimismo se ha vuelto una imperiosa exigencia para los brics la puesta en marcha de una agencia de calificación propia que rompa con el predominio aplastante que estados unidos mantiene a través de fitch moodys y standard  poors   
 estas tres agencias de calificación más que realizar evaluaciones que se guíen por criterios de tipo técnico actúan fundamentalmente bajo impulsos de carácter político esto es como auténticas máquinas de guerra degradan las notas de los bonos de deuda soberana y con ello elevan dramáticamente los costos de financiamiento de países como grecia rusia o venezuela
la cohesión económica es otro de los grandes retos si bien es indudable que se ha venido intensificando de forma sustantiva durante los años recientes entre  y  el comercio entre los brics como proporción de sus intercambios totales se duplicó del  al     china es por mucho la economía que está más integrada con los demás brics en contraste los vínculos entre países como la india y sudáfrica son marginales lo mismo sucede entre brasil y rusia por eso es muy pertinente la próxima implementación de un área de libre comercio entre los brics    sin embargo además de echar abajo las barreras arancelarias entre ellos los brics necesitan promover la construcción de cadenas de valor de forma conjunta esto es integrar sus aparatos productivos para incentivar la industrialización de las economías menos aventajadas
en conclusión son muchos los desafíos en el horizonte para estas cinco potencias emergentes estoy convencido de que en lo sucesivo el éxito de los brics dependerá de la capacidad que tengan para reinventarse de su creatividad para articular nuevas dimensiones de cooperación con vistas a cumplir metas de más largo alcance frente a la nueva guerra financiera que prepara estados unidos es momento de que los brics vuelvan a la carga

No Author,internet erupts in mockery after sarah palin posts something monumentally stupid again tweets,"on october    pm  
new video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father fred trump young donald trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants 
as part of an investigation by nbc news stanley leibowitz who worked as a rental agent for the trump organization told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties 
in the interview leibowitz said that trump told him i dont rent to the nword and indicates that trump made this statement with donald trump in the room and that the younger trump affirmed the policy 
the revelation comes at the same time that the clinton campaign has released a video highlighting trumps runin with the federal government over discrimination 
undercover investigators were sent to trump properties and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing the white applicants were allowed into the trump properties 
one bit of testimony determined that trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a c on the documents for colored and that was a sign that they should be denied 
the trumps denied the allegation but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing 
donald trumps involvement with his fathers business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media as is his fathers  million dollars that he gave to trump to start his business but if you accept that the trump organizations history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story and no matter how trump may try to wave it away  its still there

No Author,trump accuses obama hillary clinton of founding daesh,"email 
the second presidential debate flew off the rails on sunday night when donald trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against bill clinton and suggested that hillary clinton could be in jail if hes elected in november threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server 

abcs martha raddatz one of the debate moderators asked trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking  video released friday in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission was consistent with his current behavior 
as i told you that was lockerroom talk trump said i am not proud of it i am a person who has great respect for people for my family for people of this country and im not proud of it 
trump then said if you look at the history of politics in this country no one had been so abusive of women as former president bill clinton the husband of the democratic nominee whom trump suggested intimidated those women 
three women who had previously accused bill clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with trump earlier sunday and each was seated in the front row at the debate 
mine were words  his were actions trump said 
so dont tell me about words he continued i am absolutely i apologize for those words but it is things that people say bill clinton he was impeached he was no longer allowed to practice law he had to pay an  fine to one of the women paula jones who is here tonight that when hillary brings up a point like that brings up words i say  years ago i think its disgraceful and i think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth 
donald trump if i win im going to instruct my attorney general to investigate clinton httpstcorapuickl httpstcoiwgvuleetr 
 cnn politics cnnpolitics october  the former secretary of state responded by saying that so much of what he just said is not right but that he was doing it because of his floundering campaign 
i am reminded of what my friend michelle obama advised us all she said when they go low you go high 
and look if this were just about one video maybe what hes saying tonight would be understandable she said but everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women but he never apologizes to anyone for anything 
she mentioned that trump had not apologized to the khans a couple who lost a son a muslim us soldier during the iraq war trump engaged in a lengthy backandforth with the khans after they appeared at the democratic national convention in july 
clinton also said trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera a federal judge who trump said couldnt do his job fairly because he was of mexican descent and president barack obama whose birthplace trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign 
he owes the president an apology he needs to apologize to our country and he needs to take responsibility she said 
trump responded by repeating the false claim that the clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on obamas birthplace in  he added that she owed an apology for the  emails you deleted 
if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation trump said because there have never been so many lies so much deception and were going to have a special prosecutor 
clinton said everything trump said was absolutely false but she was not surprised 
oh really trump interjected

according to the jasta law which allows government and leaders of foreign governments harassment by families of victims of the terrorist attacks it is so likely that saudi king be tried according to experts the passing of jasta may cause international chaos especially after some governments threat they will pass similar legislation to prosecute us officials if us do so 
is it possible that saudi king salman bin abdul aziz being tried for potential liability in events of september  the trial is possible by the legislation of jasta by jasta law the families of the victims could sue governments and this will lead to chaos in international relations 
in late september united states congress ignored president obamas advice and his veto and passed jasta law the justice against sponsors of terrorism act this law made ussaudi relation more chaotic 
us confederate states expressed concern to jasta legislation 
not just saudi arabia expressed concerns to jasta us confederate states also expressed concern about breaking the us quasisacred treaty with saudi arabia and asked for appealing france and the netherlands have threatened to pass similar laws which lead to a series of judicial complaints against usa and its military and diplomacy allies 
john kerry united states secretary of state showed his displeasure and called it a huge risk a few days ago kerry and adel aljubeir discussed about the ramifications of jasta and pointed out the negative impact on the diplomatic immunity of us interests he said there are ways to fix the problem while experts agreed that it is only possible to reduce the strength of america in complaining by circumvent the law 
even saudi minister warned the danger of chaos in the international system 
according to hussein ibish an expert on the persian gulf littoral states jasta will cause chaos at the international level 
last september european union warned other countries may also want to pass similar legislation and discuss impunity this threat was an addition written letters to us government 
also france the netherlands and the united kingdom representatives discussed about the feedback of this law the gulf littoral states turkey iraq jordan pakistan and japan protested against jasta

Katie,morning after status report and what we know from oregonfront to nodapl vindicated,"shtf plan  by mac slavo 
this election remains more heated than any other in modern history  and for many it has become a call to arms even if only metaphorically 
despite the fact that dnc operatives have been exposed as the ones inciting violence at rallies  robert creamer and scott foval for example  and working overtime to bus in illegal voters and rig the vote  the media is going out of its way to paint trump supporters and grassroots americans as the ones plotting violence 
most recently they are latching onto comments made by former congressman joe walsh now a conservative radio host who suggested he would pick up a musket if trump loses the election on november th im voting for trump 
on november th if trump loses im grabbing my musket 
you in 
 joe walsh walshfreedom october   
did walsh mean to imply violence that is certainly how the media is portraying it as his comments spark controversy and fuel fire to the debate over the nearing election 
the irony that his commentary drew from the imagery of foundingera patriots who stood up to tyranny was deeply lost on the left who see opponents to hillary in black and white terms  racist xenophobic utterly deplorable and inherently violent 
cnn followed up asking walsh what he meant by statement 
via cnn  
former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald trump is not elected president  
walsh  did respond to cnns jake tapper via twitter when he asked what exactly does that mean 
it means protesting participating in acts of civil disobedience doing what it takes to get our country back he responded to tapper jaketapper it means protesting participating in acts of civil disobedience doing what it takes to get our country back 
 joe walsh walshfreedom october   
after a firestorm on social media walsh doubled down stating on twitter im serious i dont think a musket would do much good these days but its time for civil disobedience on the right httpstcothjpebalwz 
 joe walsh walshfreedom october   
his heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud dirty trick and foul play by the hillary campaign as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female potus  just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about 
 erupted in response to a long train of abuses  acts of oppression and hostility listed in the declaration of independence that is being largely repeated in modern day america 
could hillarys reported election victory  or donald trumps defeat  signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or rigged trump for one has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election 
the scenario is plausible enough that the pentagon and homeland security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest

Phyllis Chesler,propalestinian propaganda lowering standards of truth in america,"the bundy verdict is another defeat for obama october   daniel greenfield 
obama inc has a lot more luck with the media than it does with trials its lynchings of police officers have not gotten very far baltimore was the biggest and most resounding defeat but it wasnt the only one and the vastly differing treatment of the bundy protesters and the dakota pipeline protesters from killing to government backing have not had their intended effect 
instead obama lost at trial again 
this time its the bundy case that was when the left realized it hated civil disobedience just before rediscovering it again when it came to environmental protests but big gov lost this one  again 
a jury thursday delivered a stunning acrosstheboard acquittal to the leaders and participants in the malheur national wildlife refuge occupation and a remarkable blow to the federal government as it tries to tamp down a national movement led by a nevada family to open public lands to ranchers miners and loggers 
the verdicts finding ammon bundy older brother ryan bundy and five others not guilty of a federal conspiracy drew elation from defense attorneys who spent five weeks arguing that the armed takeover amounted to a timehonored tradition of first amendment protest and civil disobedience 
the highprofile case riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the isolated bird sanctuary in rural eastern oregon the jurys decision proved no less dramatic and sets up a showdown in the next stage of the landrights movement 
it means that big green gov will have to think twice next time around or do a much better job of picking a jury 
the oregon prosecutors sat silently in front of their boss us attorney billy williams and the head of the fbi in oregon greg bretzing as the judge announced the not guilty pleas one by one 
but it was quickly back to more of the same 
ut the trial fireworks werent quite over a brawl broke out at the very end when six to seven us marshals surrounded ammon bundys lawyer as he stood before the judge arguing and shouting for his client to walk out the door a free man they tackled him and stunned him with a taser gun as mumford yelled what are you doing us district judge anna j brown ordered everybody out of the courtroom

as a parent you always have to be aware of what lessons your child is learning from the world around him or her i know that i wont be able to protect my yearold james from every bad thing out there but on a recent trip to the grocery store i was utterly appalled by a disturbing trend our country has become desensitized to violence in hotsauce names and its a big problem 
you cant walk down your grocers sauce isle without being bombarded by hotsauce names that romanticize violence tears of blood nuclear bombardment chile extract and death on the toilet have become standard fare in the hotsauce industry an innocent trip to purchase a simple bottle of ketchup now subliminally exposes shoppers and our impressionable children to dozens of gruesome descriptions of burning flesh brutal deaths and massive ass damage 
as soon as the hotsauce industry agreed it was okay to allow names like cremation in a bottle pepper sauce and ass grave cajun sauce to appear on store shelves any shred of decency went out the window an arms race began to see who could come up with the most violent and gory sauce name society be damned and it needs to stop before our children internalize these sorts of brutal names as the norm for hotsauce labels 
hot sauce has always been hot but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today 
i took my son james to my favorite mexican restaurant this past weekend and he didnt even blink when he saw a bottle with volcanic crucification written out in flames if he isnt bothered by this whos to say if he would even think twice if he one day saw a hot sauce called ghost pepper throat thresher 
i pray that we correct course in this country before anyone decides to make that hot sauce 
it wasnt always like this hot sauce has always been hot but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today names like franks red hot let you know you were in for some serious heat but left something to the imagination but there is no longer a moral standard for hotsauce names now all it takes to begin leading a child down a bad path is for them to glance at a sauce bottle in a friends refrigerator door

admin,clinton campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillarys benghazi hearing,"zero hedge october   
we have written frequently in recent weeks about a feud that erupted between chelsea clinton and doug band back in  after chelsea raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest between bands firm teneo the clinton foundation and the state departmentsee here  here here and here  
the feud ultimately resulted in band being forced to draft a memo spelling out in vivid detail the many entangled relationships between himself teneo the clinton foundation and the state department fortunately todays wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals for the first time the precise financial flows between the clinton foundation bands firm teneo consulting and the clinton familys private business endeavors 
the memo starts with a brief background on teneo which was created in june  shortly after declan kelly resigned from his position as united states economic envoy to northern ireland a position to which he was appointed by secretary clinton 
in june  dk consulting was founded by declan kelley mr kelly served as coo of fti consulting until june  when he stepped down and established dk consulting at that time he also became the united states economic envoy to northern ireland  pursuant to the terms of his exit agreement with fti and consistent with the ethics agreement of his uncompensated special government employee appointment at the state department mr kelly retained and continued to provide services to three paying clients coke dow and ubs and one pro bono client allstate  in late  declan retained me as a consultant to dk consulting to help support the needs of these clients in may  mr kelly resigned his envoy position at the state department in june  mr kelly and i founded teneo strategies  simultaneously mr kelly closed dk consulting and shifted its clients to teneo 
throughout the past almost  years since president clinton left office i have sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation  this memorandum strives to set forth how i have endeavored to support the clinton foundation and president clinton personally 
in a subsequent section of the memo entitled leveraging teneo for the foundation band spells all of the donations he solicited from teneo clients for the clinton foundation in all there are roughly mm of donations listed with the largest contributors being cocacola barclays the rockefeller foundation and laureate international universities 
the donations from dow chemical are particularly notable for several reasons first because of other emails revealed by wikileaks and other foia requests we now know that dow chemical ceo andrew liveris was granted special access to then secretary clinton back in july  at the same time he was embroiled in ongoing litigation with another clinton foundation donor kuwait over a failed jointventure that would have netted dow bn in cash  as band notes in his memo  month after being granted special access to secretary clinton liveris invited president clinton and band out for a day of golf moreover shortly after his meeting with secretary clinton and golf outing with president clinton liveris decided to donate  to the clinton global initiative very convenient timing for all involved 
in august of  mr kelly invited mr liveris to play golf with president clinton and me mr kelly subsequently asked dow to become a cgi sponsor at the  level which they did  as well as making a  donation to the foundation for president clinton to attend a dow dinner in davos 
the story gets even more bizarre when band reveals in the following footnote that liveris provided the dow chemical plane to fly president clinton and his staff from new york to california and then california to north korea for their golf outing  we would assume this is a simple typo by band andor hes just geographically challengedif not this certainly raises a whole other set of questions for bill 
mr liveris provided the dow plane to fly president clinton and his staff to and from california for our trip to and from north korea  as a private trip the foundation had to pay the costs of airfare mr liveris in kind contribution saved the foundation in excess of   
according to the dialy caller  dow chemical paid teneo  million in  and  million in  for a variety of consultancy services of course bill clinton was an honorary chairman of teneo and as such was set to be paid  million for that position even though he ultimately only kept  because of the scandals that erupted around the firm including their advisory relationship with mf global 
finally band also offers the following commentary on the  million in forprofit activity he was able to secure for bill clinton as of november  as well as the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements 
independent of our fundraising and decisionmaking activities on behalf of the foundation we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities  including speeches books and advisory service engagements  in that context we have in effect served as agents lawyers managers and implementers to secure speaking business and advisory service deals in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his family  for personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president clinton to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements with respect to business deals for his advisory services justin and i found developed and brought to president clinton multiple arrangements for him to accept or reject of his current  arrangements we secured all of them and we have helped manage and maintain all of his forprofit business relationships since  president clintons business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements 
a big part of those forprofit activities was a mm annual payment from laureate 
and millions in speaking fees arranged by band 
confused here is a simpler recap from the nyts nick confessore this doug band memo in the latest podesta dump is the rosetta stone of the teneoclinton foundation complex httpstcoagnsogpm 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   bands argument i am not get fully compensated for all of the stuff i do for clintonworld so you should let me do teneo everyone wins 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   now you could argue so what if band gets his clients to pop over money to a charity why is that bad 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   but consider that band was selling his clients on idea that giving to foundation was in essence a way to bolster their influence 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   clinton  band built a platform for executives to bolster their companies images bathe in bcs praise and do some good while 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   teneo extracted earnings for band and depending on what you see in these emails clinton himself teneo paid clinton until late  
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   i guess you can wave it all off as a nothingburger but chelsea clinton and some of clintons other aides were clearly freaking out 
 nick halloween nickconfessore october   generally the emails show clintons own closest aides troubled or horrified by things that her surrogates have spent years waving off

Corey Savage,ways to forge strength through challenges,"after this october surprise donald trump only has one option left expose the clinton crimes michael on television democrats are now calling for a revolution in the streets and i believe that they are quite serious by michael snyder on november th  
the surprise victory by donald trump on november th has spawned a series of violent protests and riots all over the nation as stunned leftists continue to throw the largest postelection temper tantrum in us history protesters in large cities all across america have been disrupting public transportation looting stores hurling objects at the police and burning trump in effigy there have even been shootings at antitrump rallies in seattle and in portland  hundreds of protesters have been arrested so far and organizers are promising that this is only just the beginning meanwhile large numbers of enraged leftists are physically threatening trump on twitter  and some are even calling for a violent revolution sadly i believe that they are quite serious about this 
even some big celebrity names are starting to use the word revolution in messages to their followers on twitter katy perry has ominously warned that  the revolution is coming  and comedian sarah silverman has boldly declared that  trump gets a chance to hear us or else we r them if he fails revolution in the streets  
of course other leftists are seeking less violent ways to oppose trump there is a major push to use the electoral college to block a trump presidency if that fails there are many hoping to immediately impeach trump once he takes office and other activists such as former labor secretary robert reich are calling for a new third party if their planned postelection takeover of the democratic party is not successful 
but for many on the radical left the time for patience is over the not my president movement is taking off like a rocket and one survey found that only  percent of all clinton supporters consider trumps victory to be legitimate a protest near trump tower in new york city on saturday drew approximately  people and usa today reported that the antitrump protest in portland oregon on saturday night rapidly  devolved into a riot  
it is becoming clear that these protests are not going away any time soon and some are even beginning to refer to this movement as the purple revolution  
no sooner had trump been declared the  th president of the united states sorosfunded political operations launched their activities to disrupt trump during obamas lameduck period and thereafter the swiftness of the purple revolution is reminiscent of the speed at which protesters hit the streets of kiev the ukrainian capital in two orange revolutions sponsored by soros one in  and the other ten years later in  
as the clintons were embracing purple in new york street demonstrations some violent all coordinated by the sorosfunded moveonorg and black lives matter broke out in new york los angeles chicago oakland nashville cleveland washington austin seattle philadelphia richmond st paul kansas city omaha san francisco and some  other cities across the united states 
so could we actually see a violent revolution on the streets of america 
is the radical left really so horrified by the prospect of a trump presidency that they would actually be willing to engage in a prolonged campaign of chaos violence and physical intimidation 
well the oath keepers are so concerned about what this movement could become that they have initiated an intelligence gathering operation that they are calling operation hypo  
clearly as oath keepers we cannot simply sit around and watch while the enemies of liberty work to use violence to initiate a communist revolution in our country as a result of the intelligence being provided by our operation sabot operatives we have initiated operation hypo we have allowed our personnel to burrow deep inside these protest organizations to collect information regarding tactics motivations schedules and logistics 
we had operatives at the planning meetings for the protests that occurred last evening in baltimore md and philadelphia pa  our operatives have also penetrated numerous other planning organizations in cities across the country for opsec reasons the precise list of cities we are operating in will not be publicly disclosed 
and one thing that we already know is that the radical left is hoping to organize the largest political protest in united states history in washington dc on inauguration day i will be writing about this later today on the most important news  
the election of donald trump has been the single most galvanizing event for the radical left that we have seen in decades one of the early leaders of the not my president movement is filmmaker michael moore and the following are three of his key action points which he feels must be implemented immediately  
 must quickly and decisively form an opposition movement the likes of which hasnt been seen since the s i will do my part to help lead this as im sure many others bernie elizabeth warren moveon the hiphop community dfa etc will too the core of this opposition force will be fueled by young people who as with occupy wall street and black lives matter dont tolerate bs and are relentless in their resistance to authority they have no interest in compromising with racists and misogynists  prepare to impeach trump just as the republicans were already planning to do with president hillary from day one we must organize the apparatus that will bring charges against him when he violates his oath and breaks the law  and then we must remove him from office  must commit right now to a vigorous fight including civil disobedience if necessarywhich will block any and all donald trump supreme court nominees who do not meet our approval we demand the democrats in the senate aggressively filibuster any nominees who support citizens united or who oppose the rights of women immigrants and the poor this is nonnegotiable 
but of course other liberals are still in the shock and disbelief stage as i have stated before americans were more emotionally invested in this election than they had been in any election in decades and the aftermath has not been pretty 
this has been particularly true on college campuses all over the nation according to the new york post  college administrators have been going to extraordinary lengths to soothe the deep emotional pain that many of their students are experiencing ?the university of michigan offered its traumatized students coloring books and playdoh to calm them are its students in college or kindergarten ?the university of kansas reminded its stressedout kids that therapy dogs a regular campus feature were available ?cornell university an ivy league school held a campuswide cryin with officials handing out tissues and hot chocolate ?tufts university offered its devastated students arts and crafts sessions ok not kindergarten  more like summer camp ?at campuses from elite yale to connecticut to iowa and beyond professors canceled classes andor exams  either because students asked or because instructors were too distraught to teach 
and it is also being reported that suicide hotlines are ringing off the hook all over the nation 
we have never seen anything like this ever before and i have a feeling that this not my president movement is going to absolutely dwarf the occupy wall street and black lives matter movements and considering the very high levels of anger frustration and pain that these radical leftists are feeling it is easy to see how this movement could become very violent 
many patriots conservatives and christians were hoping that donald trump could bring america together and lead us into a new era of peace and prosperity but the radical left already hates trump more than any president that has ever come before him 
it isnt going to take much to push the radical left over the edge and if that happens we could see endless chaos violence and civil unrest for the next four years",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,84.45285857853474,41,6,8022,1330,4.992481203007519,221.66666666666663,-0.6408287852880403,-0.7657300402589515,1.3342884937679922,1.3070605993579103,-0.095375077743123,-0.4289186625374745,0.0097744360902255,0.0,0.0015037593984962,0,8,0.0,0.0210356000937422,-0.9974,0.093,0.137,0.771,Negative,Very Strong

David Stockman,chart of the day soaring obamacare premiums by state,"posted on october   by tony elliott 
it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank  via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states  thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january   another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true  snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on   the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushes plan on getting out of the country as well

marlene,comment on congress attorney general lynch pleads fifth on secret iran ransom payments by marlene,"daisy luther 
according to a report in the new yorker james comey  big kahuna of the fbi went fullon cowboy in releasing details of the new clinton email inquiry apparently the department of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election 
gosh i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was donald trump who was being investigated by the fbi 
comey explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees  
we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record 
the doj  and by doj i mean attorney general loretta lynch  who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill clinton to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election 
heres comeys letter to the senate judiciary committee 
really 
the doj thinks that the public shouldnt know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi 
thats the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time and considering this election thats really saying something 
this is from the new yorker report emphasis mine 
on friday james comey the director of the federal bureau of investigation acting independently of attorney general loretta lynch  sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary clintons private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  
comeys decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials comey who is a republican appointee of president obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign 
hillary clinton has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source  
oh ill bet she does 
ill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach 
of course when its her things are a little different arent they 
we do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her 
and the fact that we know has severely damaged clintons campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over donald trump due to the clinton email scandal 
about a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support clinton given fbi director james comeys disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state  
finally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary clinton 
but it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be 
given other considerations  percent say it makes no difference 
meanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now 
why did james comey who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the clintons feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation 
opponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons 
they wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the clinton email negligence 
they will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it clinton isnt taking it gracefully 
clintons complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before 
this is from the telegraph  a uk publication 
hillary clinton was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the fbis bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails 
james comey announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material 
on saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put clinton  percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide down from  points just  days previously 
but wait  it gets better 
the clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr comey alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive and mrs clinton herself called the decision unprecedented and deeply troubling 
its pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election she complained addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the mustwin state of florida 
democrats questioned the timing of the agencys decision which comes as polls showed mrs clintons lead falling just  days before the presidential election 
this is like an wheeler smacking into us and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time said donna brazile the chairwoman of the democratic national committee 
the campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can 
we dont want it to knock us off our game but on the secondtolast weekend of the race we find ourselves having to tell voters keep your focus keep your eyes on the prize

No Author,sex and the presidential city,"email 
it was fiftyfour years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by isaac babel titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry the title of babels collection of short stories written when the jew and former menshevik was imbedded with prorevolution cossacks had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones 
for the backward peasants this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a decade being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt for the time being however they were inclined to tolerate the communists who at least had come to power on the promise of peace bread and land it was the assault on the gentrys land that for the time being assuaged the peasants 
responding to an aggrieved muzhik peasant dyakov the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by babel as redfaced with a gray mustache a black cape and wide red tatar trousers with silver stripes promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the muzhik cried out lord in heaven and mother of god how is this poor thing supposed to get up its on its last legs 
dyakovs ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like jesus raising lazarus from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of babels short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he wrote 
you are insulting this horse my dear fellow dyakov answered with fierce conviction pure blasphemy my dear fellow and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus ring he stretched his magnificent legs his trousers girded by cords around the knees and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a severe penetrating eye licked some invisible command from his crimson palm and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this sprightly gray blossoming romeo her muzzle lolling her legs skidding under her feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious impatience the mare slowly and deliberatey rose onto her legs and then we all saw dyakovs slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty mane and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks her whole body shivering the mare stood on four legs without moving her timid doglike lovestruck eyes from dyakov 
so you seethis is a horse dyakov said to the muzhik  and added softly and you were complaining my dearest of friends 
throwing his reins to his orderly the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap and swirling off his operatic cloak disappeared into the headquarters 
today reading this story once again for the first time in fiftyfour years i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like ezra pound james joyce and thomas mann he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early s i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse 
my early connections to modernism and my later connections to marxism that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early s converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on october  th at the cinema village in new york directed by david novack who has a background as a sound engineer it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of ukraine today as a possible trigger of wwiii according to some babels multiple identity as jew ukrainian communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering 
the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by andrei malaevbabel who is the grandson of isaac babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of florida to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work isaac babel was executed for treason in  having been charged with belonging to a trotskyist group and spying for france and austria babels wife antonina pirozhkova who died at the age of  in  is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in  the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new york times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering degree she helped to design the moscow subway system the obit notes 
ms pirozhkova recalled babels dismay at her haphazard reading habits which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director sergei m eisenstein and visits by foreign luminaries like andré gide and andré malraux 
it was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original russian revolution rather than to fall in line as a stalin toady 
as he travels around ukraine malaevbabel encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for odessa tales another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in  and  the stories focus on jewish gangsters living in moldavanka an odessa slum hardly the material youd expect to find written by a partisan of the russian revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to terences observation  homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto  or i am human and nothing of that which is human is alien to me 
although i have never read odessa tales i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort of characters my grandfather louis proyect probably knew in byelorussia and who like him escaped pogroms by emigrating to the usa unlike my grandfather who made a life out of building hotels in sullivan county in upstate ny abe kid twist reles and other members of murder incorporated only saw the borscht belt as a place where they could dump their victims in swan lake about fifteen minutes from my home town 
throughout the film we hear brief excerpts from both collections narrated by liev schreiber that will be a good introduction to babels literary power there are also interviews with some leading babel scholars including stanford professor gregory freidin who spent a day traveling around paris with malaevbabel to see places where babel lived for a few years before returning to russia we learn that although he could have avoided becoming one of stalins countless victims by living in exile he was too attached to russian culture and language to live abroad 
while in paris babel wrote a play titled maria that likely put him on stalins shitlist although being a freethinking intellectual and artist might have condemned from the start with his theater background malaevbabel is ideally suited to discuss the play with fellow thespians including marina vlady an acclaimed russianfrench actress who reads a letter from the titular character 
in  gregory freidin mounted a production of maria at stanford university the plays program describes major character isaac dymshit a jewish gangster as a symbol of capitalist rationality while the eponymous maria epitomized the pure romance of the revolution she like the young babel served in the red cavalry 
never seen on stage we only hear from maria indirectly as her letter is recited by another character in scene five it begins 
at dawn the bugle from squadron headquarters wakes me by eight i have to be in the political propaganda division im in charge therei edit the articles of the divisional newspaper i run the literacy classes our reinforcements are all ukrainians they remind me of italians the way they talk and act russia has been suppressing and destroying their culture for centuries in our house in petersburg opposite the hermitage and the winter palace we might as well have been living in polynesia for we knew any thing at all about our people 
it is writing lines like this that got babel killed rather than spying for france or austria 
babel was a friend and protégé of maxim gorky who remained a diehard stalinist despite sharing babels inclination for writing about the lower depths of russian society he was deeply troubled by how maria depicted political corruption prosecution of the innocent and black marketeering within soviet society gorky accused babel of having a baudelairean predilection for rotting meat apparently gorky had forgotten that baudelaire was marxs favorite novelist 
david novack the director of finding babel has a connection to odessa but not to its legendary jewish gangsters he has an ancestor named david nowakowsky who wrote liturgical music for a synagogue there 
in an interview given to the odessa review  novack sums up isaac babels relationship to the soviet experience that resonates with my own on the left as someone with roots in the existential outsider world of the s that saw albert camus as its most eloquent spokesmen i never found myself comfortable with the trotskyist milieu that fostered cultish obedience to the genius leader to this day it has been these youthful affinities with outsider culture that makes it difficult for me to join any amen chorus on the left even though it is the left that remains my homeland i think that novacks description of babels insideroutsider sensibility can help me preserve my sanity in a period of deep contradictions within the left 
babel represented the insider outsider thats what he was he got himself all the way inside up to the upper levels of the nkvd up to beria who ended up supervising his torture in the end personally i dont know if he was in the room but he had an office in the st catharines monastery where babel was tortured that monastery was being used as a torture prison the sukhanovo prison which we note in the film we visited it he got himself as close to the flame as possible as an insider but yet he was an outsider because he was from odessa he was jewish he should not even have been permitted to study under gorky which is where he really honed his skills the only reason that he was able to study under gorky is that he smuggled himself illegally to st petersburg when he wasnt allowed to be there because it was outside the settlement area for jews so babel was an outsider he then found himself with red calvary with the cossacks in the red army running through western ukraine as he documented brutality against the ukrainians and the jews brutality brought on by both sides it was a civil war essentially between the reds and the poles who suffered the most the jews and the ukrainians the peasantry are the ones who suffered the most in that conflict there he was again the outsider insider its from this very unique perspective where all his writing came from",counterpunch.org,Fake,english,6.007619328947518,47.88118811881188,29,5,11613,2013,4.751614505712866,2013.0,-1.0077292574050325,-0.9536307555522068,2.28436535900825,2.377786578971485,-0.3330868860189242,2.444975715570736,0.0004967709885742,0.0,0.0004967709885742,0,0,0.0,0.0008796634736284,-0.9713,0.082,0.09,0.827,Negative,Very Strong

concern grows over soroslinked voting machines   
sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by edmund kozak  updated  oct  at  pm  
concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist george soros and his personal quest to create a nationless borderless global state 

the ukbased smartmatic company posted a flowchart on its website that it had provided voting machines for  states including important battleground states like florida and arizona smartmatic chairman mark mallochbrown is a former un official and sits on the board of soros open society foundations since the story first broke the flowchart has disappeared from smartmatics website raising further questions about the real status of the sorostied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in us elections 

if mallochbrowns soros ties werent troubling enough he also has ties to the clintons through his work at two consulting firms 

according to a spokesperson for the national association of secretaries of state smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states have contested that their equipment came from smartmatic why then had smartmatic bragged about providing over  voting machines for us elections

breaking hillaryclintons email server company got almost  million in govt loans after wiping emails   
october    
by charles c johnson  comments  
give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information 

stay tuned for more

why bill clintons  trips on the lolita express child rape jet matter may    
daniel greenfield   
we dont know what bill clinton did or didnt do in company with jeffrey epstein but we certainly know what epstein did and almost as outrageously what he got away with doing  

some of the most shocking allegations against epstein surfaced only after the conclusion of an fbi probe in civil suits brought by his victims for example the claim that three yearold french girls were delivered to him as a birthday present but the feds did identify roughly  young women most of them underage at the time who described being lured to epsteins palm beach home on the pretense of giving a massage for money then pressured into various sex acts as well as the balkan sex slave epstein allegedly boasted of purchasing from her family when she was just  more recently a big cash payment from mail on sunday coaxed one of epsteins main accusers out of anonymity to describe what she claims were her years as a teenage sex toy this victim virginia roberts produced a photo of herself with prince andrew in  and reported that epstein paid her  to meet the prince then  years old she claims that she was abused by epstein and loaned to his friends from the age of  

sex crimes of the kind roberts alleges took place typically carry a term of  to  years in federal prison yet when all was said and done epstein served his scant yearplusonemonth in a private wing of the palm beach jail and was granted a hourperday free pass to leave the premises for work 

in short epstein was never actually in jail during his house arrest he flew around the country on his jets from his new york city place to his private island at least one of epsteins victims claimed to have met bill clinton and it turns out that bill clinton was a much more regular passenger on the lolita express 

former president bill clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offenders infamous jet than previously reported with flight logs showing the former president taking at least  trips aboard the lolita express  even apparently ditching his secret service detail for at least five of the flights according to records obtained by foxnewscom 

clintons presence aboard jeffrey epsteins boeing  on  occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between  and  included extended junkets around the world with epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including tatiana the trickedout jet earned its nabakovinspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls 

it doesnt help that the democratic establishment seems to have played a role in getting epstein a pass on child rape that bill clinton already had rape accusations in his past or that the clintons had become notorious for their willingness to do favors for criminals in exchange for money 

either way weve come a long way from gary hart being bounced for monkey business to bill clinton flying around on a child rapists plane without anyone in the media seeming to care much about it 

social conservatives often get a bad rap but there really is no limit to how low standards can fall when any trace of a moral code vanishes out the window what did bill clinton actually do who knows more importantly these days who cares 

about daniel greenfield 

daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 

for sure defence counsel have made much of taylors involvement with the missing and murdered women all but pointing the finger at her as homicidal maniac the real killer whats not in dispute is that taylor is one scary character  streethardened menacing a procurer of prostitutes lured to the pickton farm contemptuous of both sextrade workers especially street walkers and drug addicts 

shes pure evil says one outreach worker who asked that her name not be used in any story about taylor 

 

court has heard that taylors dna was found on  items retrieved from the pickton property  including handcuffs condoms clothing syringes  and also on items that belonged to some victims  brenda wolfes lipstick mona wilsons rosary 

one witness pickton pal pat casanova told the court he once received fellatio from a woman he knew as angel whod been brought to the farm by taylor he said he gave the money to taylor who shared some of it with angel 

another witness gina houston put taylor on the same bed with victim sereena abotsway in picktons trailer 

in his lengthy police interview pickton repeatedly tells police he wants to speak with taylor 

on the stand houston recounted a conversation shed had with pickton about taylor shortly before his arrest 

willie told me that he believed she taylor would do the right thing when she came back that she would take responsibility for what she said she would take responsibility for

jeff wells points to other odd things 

a week or so ago a man called steve remian committed suicidebycop but the name steve remian surfaced at the robert willie pickton murder trial in new westminster bc last march when jurors were told that remians name  with a burnaby bc address  was on the label of a suitcase packed into a box found in picktons workshop 

in april jurors heard further evidence that dna testing on two hairs found on a hudsons bay blanket removed from picktons motorhome linked one to pickton and the other to a steve remian 

a source involved in the oakville shooting investigation told the star that the man shot by police had been charged with sexual assault earlier in life while living in oakville but had been acquitted although a coaccused was convicted 

source 

it does seem like a regular hive of activity robert picktons pig farm was a constant buzz of activity with people and vehicles coming and going all the time a woman who lived in picktons trailer for a time testified on wednesday 

tanya carr  told the jury in picktons murder trial that people were coming and going all day long at the port coquitlam bc farm and it wasnt unusual for people to show up late at night looking for pickton or his brother dave 

source 

also there are those hells angels and the piggy palace 

it was a rough crowd at piggys palace said brian a musician who played there a few years ago with the hardrock band south city slam 

the nightclub he said was inside an old building on a property dave pickton and his brother robert own at  burns rd near their pig farm on dominion road in port coquitlam 

even the women were tough looking  a lot of leather and denim it wasnt a cocktailgown kind of place  he recalled 

brian who didnt want his last name used recalled that there was a coatcheck girl and a sign saying check your knives and other weapons at the door  

the crowd at piggys palace often included men wearing hells angels biker club colours 

they were there a lot said brian the people who came all seemed to know one another

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

Gillian,get ready for a likely market crash after election video w transcript,"by gordon duff senior editor on october   radio host and trump supporter claims jewish mafia controls us 
editors note the insanity has hit trump mouthpiece and arch zionist alex jones is on the warpath against the jewish mob israels newspapers are shocked as you can see below  or are they trump grandson of a brothel owner son of a slum lord grew up in meyer lanskys mobrun new york and by his s became the ingenuemoney boy of jewish mob kingpin roy cohn it was roy cohn and the jewish mob that built trumps empire and ran interference for him with the gambinos john gotti  company now covering this up seems to be really important but to whom and why 
the article below was published in todays jerusalem post not a word of it is true moreover it is an obvious deflection piece written to save trumps nazi supporters backing in face of vts slam dunk assertions of trumps zionist fanaticism 
after all trump has pushed for war on iran for clearing out the west bank and for a one state solution in israel with palestinians going through the chimneys 
but why then are americas jew haters the human filth that would gas americas jews the big trump lovers some of it comes from the nazi movement itself largely begun as a fundraiser by the adljdlaipacsplc lobby you see no swastikas painted on synagogues no big corporate donations on alex jones by brother nathaniel  a long accused rabid antizionist 
the controversy of alex bullhorn jones being an alleged zionist shill has now expanded to his apparent zionistjewish connections on his  personal staff  website advertisers  link to time warner president edgar bronfman jr 
jones seeming allegiance to zionism which explains why he virtually never targets zionist jews or the racist zionist rogue state of israel when engaging in his notorious rants and attacks  may well stem from a protestantzionist belief system and the widely circulated reports that his wife is a jew  which makes his two children jewish under talmudic law and eligible for the israeli law of return  
with additional information on jones which this site is now providing alex jones zionist connections prompting his reticence to expose global zionism becomes ever more obvious 
trump has played the hate card from day one building his base on hatred of blacksafrican americans messicans and of course he has played the terror card the yellow hordes card and the elite liberal card as well 
that one is aimed at the jews trump whose empire was built by roy cohn and who has been supported and financed by jewish organized crime and now by vegas boss shelly adelson who can buy and sell trump out of his trump change has always been a front for the jewish mob jewish mobsters as oft pointed out by ian greenhalgh have surrounded trump and embarrassed him if you can imagine that more than once 
years ago during nasty litigation radio host jeff rense former partner of alex jones tracked jones and his backing to the jewish mob and the bronfman crime family accused of their complicity in financing  
now we see the zionist press pulling out the antisemite card on alex jones one of israels strongest supporters in the us is this a joke of course this kind of childishness would only work with the brain dead jew hating nazis that have flocked to trump with trumps effusive love of everything israel and everything zionist one might ask why the nazis flock to him but nazis have never been thinkers and are great followers even when they are sent over a cliff like lemmings 
comment boards at vt have been inundated with paid trolls some who track back to israel others employed by trump surrogate operations tied to his campaign toads and trolls get up to  for a comment placed even on wrong articles thus we have closed comments to cut off this income source and clean out the trash were we can even though this is the best money trump pays out except for hookers 
when are american jews going to rise off their knees and hit back at well at israel the adl and the rising tide of naziism in the us paid for by their donations

"David Gutierrez, staff writer",why hydrogen peroxide should be in every home,"doctors prescribe deadly opioid for painrelated issues that arent even legal share in big pharma  fda  harmful medicine  health  medical marijuana  pharmaceutical drug addiction 
corruption bribery death all three are examined in various news reports on a little known specialty pharmaceutical company called insys theraputics they are currently under legal fire for subsys a controversial sublingual spray that disperses fentanyl a very fast acting opioid that is  times more potent than morphine the under the tongue delivery allows the fentanyl to bypass the gastrointestinal system and deliver the opioid directly into the blood stream the federal drug administration fda has ruled that subsys can only be prescribed to help cancer patients gain relief from sudden spikes of excruciating pain 
sarah fuller was a  year old woman who suffered from anxiety and fibromyalgia  she didnt have cancer but that didnt stop her doctor from prescribing subsys for her aches and pains the fentanyl acted quickly with sarahs already prescribed xanax a benzodiazepine she died her family is suing the manufacturer but why did sarahs doctor prescribe a drug that wasnt approved thats easy to answer just follow the money 
as stat reports the sales of subsys grew to  million precisely because physicians give it to patients that dont have cancer like sarah fuller doctors get big dollars to simply talk about the drug over dinner or lunch over  million dollars have been paid to doctors and health practitioners for this word of mouth activity 
take the example of nurse practitioner heather alfonso from illinois she was paid  to go to dinner with a few people and in response prescribed  million dollars of subsys scripts to patients that werent suffering with cancer pain she didnt contest the allegations against her 
getting paid to speak isnt automatically a bribe but it appears to be a consistent theme when it comes to susbys marketing methods alabama prosecutors built a case against nancy reed perhacs who used to be a sales representative for insys theraputics ms perhacs coordinated speaking fees for a doctor friend provided he prescribed subsys her take was  other investigations about similar practices are ongoing in kansas rhode island new york oregon michigan florida and new hampshire 
the chief executive founder and chairman of insys theraputics is billionaire john kapoor hes been around the block with other controversial pharmaceutical start ups kapoor thinks doctors are all ethical his new fda approved drug is a chemically created synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol thc called syndros as states legalize the real medicine in cannabis  thc and cbd oil  this is an important pharmaceutical to boycott

Daisy Luther,ag lynch told fbi director comey not to go public with the new clinton email investigation,"posted on october   by daisy luther 
oh loretta 
ill bet that ag loretta lynch is shaking in her boots right now because when hillary clinton goes down lynchs career will go down with her heck maybe theyll even be cellmates 
loretta lynchs ties to the clintons go back to  when thenpresident bill clinton appointed her to run the brooklyn us attorneys office she left in  and went into private practice but returned to the brooklyn office in  at the behest of president barack obama  heres her official bio  
in  she was sworn in to become the rd attorney general of the united states taking the place of the blatantly corrupt attorney general eric holder  who will probably be most famous for his roles in the fast and furious operation inciting racial tensions and his mishandling of the lois lernerirs debacle first there was the secret airplane meeting with bill clinton 
it all started to publicly go downhill for lynch during the first investigation into hillary clintons carelessness with national secrets via her home email server  right before fbi director james comey was to meet with hillary clinton to interrogate her about the subject lynch was busted having a secret meeting with bill clinton  the washington post reported 
clintons private unplanned meeting with attorney general loretta e lynch at the phoenix airport last week coming at a time when the justice department should be nearing completion of its examination of hillary clintons use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state will inevitably  and negatively  affect public attitudes about that investigation 
lynch has tried to make amends though not without leaving some confusion in her wake in a conversation friday with washington post editorial writer jonathan capehart at the aspen ideas festival she insisted again that the conversation was innocent  about grandchildren and golf and such  and did not touch on the investigation of the emails but she said she recognized that others would not see it that way the fact that the meeting that i had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that i take seriously and deeply and painfully she said 
lynch said that she would be accepting whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and fbi director james b comey bring her  though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case she also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public 
of course it was all much easier for lynch to abide by the decision when comey miraculously found that hillary clinton was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets 
now though people are asking questions about that illfounded meeting judicial watch has filed a lawsuit for all records related to the illicit meeting between attorney general lynch and former president bill clinton  
on june   attorney general loretta lynch is reported to have met privately with former president bill clinton on board a parked private plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the thenongoing investigation of mrs clintons email server and mere hours before the benghazi report was released publicly involving both mrs clinton and the obama administration judicial watch filed a request on june  that the us department of justice office of the inspector general investigate that meeting 
republican presidential nominee donald trump suggested that during that meeting bill clinton may have offered to extend lynchs position in the ags office during a hillary clinton administration then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious iranian ransom payment 
last week ag lynch blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the obama administration made to iran by pleading the fifth the washington free beacon reported 
attorney general loretta lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran  billion in cash earlier this year prompting accusations that lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon  
it is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the peoples elected representatives in congress about an important national security issue the lawmakers wrote your staff failed to address any of our questions and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue 
as the united states chief law enforcement officer it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries they stated the actions of your department come at time when iran continues to hold americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison 
how very judicial of her lynch tried to shut comey up about the new investigation into the clinton emails 
now even the mainstream media cant turn its head 
earlier i wrote about the fact that fbi director james comey made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the hillary clinton emails but lets talk a little further about lynchs desperate attempts to shut him up 
the new york times reported that the justice department strongly discouraged comey against releasing the information the day before the fbi director james b comey sent a letter to congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed hillary clinton email investigation the justice department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy three law enforcement officials said on saturday senior justice department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter officials said but they did everything short of it pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections 
how interesting that its seen as influencing the election to investigate someone now but it wasnt back when she was investigated and not charged im not sure exactly how that works but according to usa today emphasis mine a federal official familiar with comeys decision said saturday that the fbi director considered the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter thursday and early friday but felt compelled to act do you remember janet reno 
poor janet was another attorney general who went down for the clintons she was also sworn in as ag under bill clinton and many questioned her appointment at the time according to a report in the chicago tribune  
she arrived in washington from miami as caesars wife and so she has remained she was ignorant and independent of insider dc and has stayed that way bill clinton never much liked her and never confided in her and she reciprocated 
she became ag just in time to take the fall for the debacle in waco  actually according to historycom 
the waco standoff had already begun by the time janet reno became the first female attorney general on march   she approved the fbis tear gas plan the following month explaining that negotiations with the branch davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk we will never know whether there was a better solution reno said in  everyone involved  made their best judgments based on all the information we had nonetheless a republicanled congressional report called her decision premature wrong and highly irresponsible she was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements 
the tribune post continued to discuss renos position as a scapegoat 
every day since she took office  she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to clintonwhitewater fundraising lewinsky china espionage etc clinton cant afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her 
but no such attorney general could have survived the clinton scandals much less survived them with her own reputationand her departmentsintact 
attorney generals who have anything to do with the clintons dont seem to fare too well they end up so embroiled in clinton scandals that they too are pulled down into the mire regardless of what their intentions were when they started out lynch can see her futureand it has something to do with help wanted ads 
the last time lynch was involved in the clinton email kerfuffle she promised to abide by fbi director james comeys recommendation  
i wonder if shell make that same promise this time 
she really cant because if she does it will show she was complicit with the clintons the last time around and also this time when she decried comeys release of information about the investigation 
i wonder if she and hillary clinton will be able to get adjoining cells whenif the truth comes out

Hrafnkell Haraldsson,fox news calls for special prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton,"by hrafnkell haraldsson    pm were not conceding were behind in our enthusiasm we have closed the gapdramatically over the last week   
donald trumps deputy campaign manager the clintonobsessed republican operative david bossie told abc news george stephanopoulos this morning that theres an enthusiasm gap and that this bit of math republicans do is trumps path to victory on november  
this is how the conversation went per cbs news sopan deb  as always highlighting the important bits 
stephanopoulos was not about to let bossie get away with the claim about trumps tax returns and hammered him on the issue hes going to release his tax return when he is not under audit david bossie trump deputy campaign manager httpstcoyxvgrjix 
 good morning america gma november   
bossie deflected like a pro you can see why trump hired him 
as a corollary to bossies claims trump suddenly found himself interested in polls again this morning tweeting  wow now leading in abc  washingtonpost poll  to  gone up  points in two weeks mostly before the crooked hillary blowup 
 donald j trump realdonaldtrump november   
the trump campaign has always been about making much out of nothing elections are not rigged if trump gets his way and neither are polls if trump is leading otherwise its all leftwing shenanigans 
however even newt gingrich isnt buying the new poll washington postabc poll is an absurdity trump has not moved up  points in the last  dayshe was never  points behind ignore polls 
 newt gingrich newtgingrich november   
and what trump fails to mention is that his lead disappears if johnson and stein are taken out of the mix then clinton leads by   
these latest claims are an absolute sham as clinton leads overwhelmingly in early voting and comeys email gambit seems to have failed to sway voters to trumps camp 
meanwhile trumps own legal problems are beginning to overwhelm the narrative  and if there is any evidence of a clinton enthusiasm gap it exists only in bossies own head 
david bossie is living proof that clintons vast rightwing conspiracy is real and all the hating on hillary isnt going to change the fact that it is trump who is the crooked candidate not hillary clinton",politicususa.com,Real,english,100.0,88.90571715706947,68,10,2197,364,4.925824175824176,364.0,0.1846972769751917,-0.0141271790859303,-0.2068414811761741,-0.2073190438437196,-0.1611590264749738,-0.2005686626394087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.7202,0.072,0.054,0.874,Positive,Strong

No Author,après le succès de  mariés au premier regard  m va lancer  fécondées au premier regard   le gorafi,"keywords food packaging  packaging 
one of the major reasons why lots of people choose organic foods is to avoid exposure to chemicals however most of these organic foods such as beans  often come in packaging which if not done well there are lots of chemicals present that can greatly interfere with the normal physiology especially if there is a wrong choice of packaging company 
various types of food packaging can possibly leach compounds into your food investigate your packaging kitchen and youll observe a lot of materials to be concerned about regardless of the possibility that youre for the most part a real food type of individual you presumably have canned merchandise oats pastas and granola bars packaged in plastic bags plastic wrap and plastic storage in your washroom 
most by far of food and refreshment cans which seem by all accounts to be made of metals like steel and aluminum in reality are lined with bpa bps or deplorable substitutes like polyvinyl chloride pvc which contains the known cancercausing agent vinyl chloride your canned soup soda significantly seltzer or juices are likely exposing you to bpa and different compounds youre in an ideal situation not ingesting 
even packaging made of evidently amiable paper might be lined with chemicals of concern like pfass which can be found in pizza boxes and the wrapping of slick takeout food extra chemicals from flame retardants to bpa have worked their way into our paper packaging as laudable efforts to recycle paper have presented a variety of different contaminants 
the environmental working group ewg has added yet another database to its arsenal of chemical data for consumers permitting the individuals who need to avoid exposure to toxins to check for bpa in their food packaging they built up the database since they contend that consumers have a right to recognize whats in their food  particularly with regards to an ingredient for example bpa that has been linked to cancer infertility mind nervous system and cardiovascular abnormalities diabetes obesity and different genuine disorders theres no simple route for your average consumer to discover what their food is stuffed in and little research demonstrating the amount of these chemicals migrate into our food 
a wholefood unpackaged eating regimen is your best safeguard against the chemicals in packaging also it is very important to check the reputation of the packaging company and if they are positively or negatively rated since there are such a large number of unknowns with regards to packaging your most solid option is to avoid it when conceivable proper packaging is can go a long way in ensuring that you retain the health of your body 
one of the key things in making the packaging safe is by entrusting a packaging company that knows the importance of eliminating all chemicals in the food stuffs there are packaging companies that are more careful when dealing with food packaging your foods wrongly and without proper care can not only pose a risk in your health but it can ruin your name as the packaging company below are some of the ways that you can drastically reduce the harm that may arise during the food packaging at the point when conceivable avoid canned foods and beverages plastic wrap and plastic bottles instead pick a glass when you can and cook beans yourself but if you must buy look out for the reputable packaging companies accomplish your very own greater amount food preservation to lessen your exposure to packaging chemicals have a go at dehydrating some of your gardens harvest and storing it in glass containers avoid putting hot food in plastic storage containers or heating foods packaged in plastic in the microwave plastics are significantly more inclined to leach chemicals when heated experts recommend keeping plastics out of the dishwasher too 
by following the above measures it can go a very long way in ensuring that you do not consume chemicals that are risky to your health

Admin,far worse than the fourth reich  the day of reckoning has arrived,"steve bannon donalds trumps chief strategist and senior counselor 
as a jew who has worked for years with steve bannon i can tell you he is not an antisemite or a white nationalist he doesnt have an antisemitic bone in his body  david horowitz jewish founder of the david horowitz freedom center and editor of frontpage magazine  
when presidentelect donald trump named steve bannon the controversial media figure behind the altright website breitbart news network as his senior strategist  major jewish groups raised the alarm 
the antidefamation league condemned the move saying bannons website was home to racists and fostered hatred against jews but to his jewish defenders  which include breitbarts ceo and senior editors for the site  he is an ally and proud zionist 
i can say without hesitation that steve is a friend of the jewish people and a defender of israel as well as being a passionate american patriot and a great leader joel pollak an orthodox jew and a senior editor for breitbart news wrote on monday 
indeed breitbarts origin story has its roots in israel according to larry solov breitbarts ceo and president another close jewish colleague of bannon 
in a november  post on breitbart news solov describes the conception of the news site in  it happened solov writes during a trip to israel with andrew breitbart the jewish founder and namesake of the website 
the site was born to defend the jewish state 
one thing we specifically discussed that night was our desire to start a site that would be unapologetically profreedom and proisrael solov wrote we were sick of the antiisrael bias of the mainstream media 
solov and breitbart were blown away by the spirit tenacity and resourcefulness of the israeli people on that trip solov wrote 
breitbart died in  and bannon became editor of the site 
under bannons leadership the site became one of the best known platforms and gateways for the altright a diverse group that traffics in white nationalism and racism richard spencer  a founder of the political movement who advocates for the creation of a white ethnostate called breitbart a gateway to altright ideas and writers 
during trumps campaign the site became particularly enamored with the republican candidate and lampooned and attacked his opponents 
for ben shapiro a former writer at breitbart news bannon betrayed the original vision of the sites founder 
andrew breitbart despised racism shapiro wrote on monday with bannon embracing trump all that changed now breitbart has become the altright goto website  pushing white ethnonationalism as a legitimate response to political correctness and the comment section turning into a cesspool for white supremacist mememakers 
but even as the site may have appealed to antisemites it retained its zionist bona fides under bannon 
in  bannon launched a jerusalem branch of breitbart news which covers events in israel it is edited by israelbased american reporter aaron klein another bannon advocate klein a yeshiva university graduate is also a columnist for the jewish press a weekly newspaper with a conservative bent 
klein recently called the antitrump protests across the country a product of professional agitators who are seeking the downfall of the us capitalist system 
the activist pamela geller known for her antiislamic campaigning also counts herself among bannons jewish allies on twitter geller defended bannon recently dismissing those who were characterizing bannon as an antisemite 
he partnered with breitbart  a jew she wrote he partnered with larry solov after breitbart died a jew he worked with me  a jew then she added zionist 
david horowitz founder of the conservative think tank david horowitz freedom center also came to bannons defense saying bannon does not have an antisemitic bone in his body 
as a jew who has worked for years with steve bannon horowitz wrote in an email to the forward i can tell you he is not an antisemite or a white nationalist ld  for further proof that steve bannon is not going to do anything to challenge jewish power in america or stand up to israel see this thoughtprovoking article in the occidental observer  antisemitism as political assassination the smearing of steve bannon i really do feel at this stage though of course i could be wrong that diehard antisemites and ardent white nationalists are most unlikely to see any of their dreams come true in the foreseeable future thats what makes antisemites and white nationalists the angriest people on earth their dreams are constantly being shattered as they see the jews becoming more powerful and tyrannical at their expense constant defeat leaves a bitter taste in the mouth like this share it now",darkmoon.me,Fake,english,9.978439716109564,7.981665512530776,65,12,4694,767,5.074315514993481,767.0,0.0929721589459437,0.3616742515005802,0.4537939776110505,0.4244563145519913,-0.0146126373573013,0.4459773558073397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.3898,0.103,0.098,0.799,Negative,Moderate

Ike Mclean,hamilton actor refuses to apologize for political stunt,home  news  hillary insisted america fact check her so we didheres  huge lies from the debate hillary insisted america fact check her so we didheres  huge lies from the debate fisher  mins ago news comments off on hillary insisted america fact check her so we didheres  huge lies from the debate hillary insisted america fact check her so we didheres  huge lies from the debate hillary clinton stood before millions of americans last night and told numerous lies then said things like google it suggesting we fact check herso we did and found  major lies plus others fact check   hillary clinton claimed that planned parenthood provides cancer screenings and therefore should not be defunded in spite of controversy about abortion factcheck mostly false this is a repeated claim deployed in defense of planned parenthood but it is not true at least as regards breast cancer as the leftleaning washington post s factchecker wrote in  when democratic lawmakers or other supporters assert that planned parenthood provides mammograms this is highly misleading language because it could be interpreted to mean that the group directly administers the xrays the group does not provide mammograms rather the situation is similar to other clinics where patients are referred to a licensed facility that can provide biopsies xrays or other specialized services it is slightly more accurate to say that women have access to mammograms via planned parenthood though its still slippery language fact check   hillary clinton responded to a question about supreme court and gun rights by saying i support the second amendment factcheck false when clinton made this statement she was responding to a question about the district of columbia v heller  decision a decision dealing with the foundations of the second amendment the very roots of what it protects in the heller ruling scotus reaffirmed that the second amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms this decision has become a bulwark against leftists who have spent decades in academia politics and journalism trying to persuade americans that the second amendment protects a collective right if collective the left could tie gun ownership to service in the militia and bar gun ownership for anyone save those who serve in the militia or todays military or police forces so heller is crucial in fact it is so crucial that it is not be a stretch to say the entire second amendment rests on it yet hillary disagrees the heller ruling her spokesman josh schwerin said hillary believes heller was  wrongly decided  so how can a woman who does not believe in an individual right to keep and bear arms support the second amendment she cant incidentally clinton made this point evident during the debate when she said her disagreement with the heller decision was the way the scotus applied the second amendment in that case for those of you who may not know heller centered on washington dcs gun banwhich was subsequently struck down via the scotus decision to oppose the application of the second amendment in heller is to oppose the fact that a gun ban was overturned that is not supporting the second amendment fact check   hillary clinton said during the third presidential debate in las vegas on wednesday that she will not add a penny to the debt if elected president factcheck false indeed hillary clintons claim is not even close to true the committee for a responsible federal budget predicts that under clintons policies  the debt would increase by  trillion over a decade clintons plan would increase both spending and revenue the washington dcbased independent nonprofits analyst said  under our preliminary updated central estimate she would increase primary spending by  trillion over the next decade including about  billion of spending on college education  billion each on paid family leave and infrastructure and significant new healthrelated spending fact check   hillary clinton claimed that  people a yeardie from guns factcheck false this is a claim clinton often makes to make gun violence appear to be raging out of control to justify the government stepping in with more rules and regulations to keep the american people safe however a factcheck shows clintons claim is not only false but is exaggerated by  percent she is using figures from  and reporting them in a way that distorts what really happened with guns that year clinton first began making this claim in november  repeated it in april  and has since repeated it again and again in april breitbart news highlighted the method clinton used to swell the numbers in  the centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported  firearmrelated homicides in the united states an additional  accidental firearmrelated deaths occurred in the usa figure that pales in comparison to the  deaths by accidental poisoning or the  deaths caused by falls so clinton and gun control proponents who think like her increase these figures by adding in suicides in this way  firearmrelated deathshomicides and accidental deathsquickly become  gun violence deaths in  and an impetus for gun control fact check   hillary clinton praised president obama s economic performance adding he has cut the deficit by twothirds factcheck false this repeated democratic canard relies on fraudulent accounting that only starts more than halfway through obama s first year in office after the  billion stimulus the massive omnibus spending bill porkulus and the deployment of the troubled asset relief program tarp which was signed by obama s predecessor but for which he voted as breitbart news noted when president obama claimed in january to have cut the deficit by almost threequarters this is pure fiction obama has doubled the national debt and its not because he cut the deficit rather he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in officewhich he assigns dishonestly to the previous fiscal year under george w bush he cut ie spent more gradually from that spending but only under protest after republicans took the house in  the truth is that obama vastly expanded the deficit in a doomed and illconceived experiment in keynesian stimulus spending much of which was wasted on priorities that helped obama s political supporters  especially the public sector unions  but did little for the economy fact check   hillary clinton said we at the clinton foundation spend ninety percent  ninety percent  of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country factcheck false indeed clintons ninety percent claim is false according to her troubled charitys own t ax filings  peter schweizer president of the government accountability institute  breitbart news senior editoratlarge and author of clinton cash said the clinton foundation has spent as little as six percent of its total income on actual charitable endeavors if you actually look at the numbers of their filings and s thats what it indicates schweizer said last month in an interview with siriusxm host alex marlow on breitbart news daily  the clinton foundation will say we assisted or facilitated in  kids getting immunizations well okay what does that mean and they dont really tell you they dont really explain to you how it works so the number is absolutely correct that six percent goes to other charities schweizer continued the other  percent is in this stew of marketing and management and travel expenses and sort of all these obscure things that its really hard to dissect what is the end result of that  percent being spent whats more political analyst sean davis the cofounder of the federalist and a former adviser to sen tom coburn and gov rick perry examined the clinton foundations  tax filings and found that  hillary clintons nonprofit spent more on office supplies and rent than it did on charitable grants the clinton foundation spent nearly  million percent of all  expenditureson travel davis contends  nearly  million percent of all expenditureswas spent on office supplies source check out over  more fact checks at breitbart so there you have it folks it was hard to narrow it down to just  but these were among the biggest lies of the

EdJenner,cnn panel cant explain election outcome,"democratic congressman threatens violence if gop tries to defund planned parenthood by hank berrien november   
the democratic congressman who is challenging house minority leader nancy pelosi ohio rep tim ryan threatened a youngstown street fight if donald trump attempts to defund planned parenthood 
speaking with jake tapper on cnns state of the union on sunday ryan intimated that defunding planned parenthood wasnt the only stimulus he would need to launch violence he stated if he tries to defund planned parenthood if he tries to kick people off their health insurance if they try to privatize medicare or cut taxes for the wealthy you know we are going to have a youngstown street fight in the capitol 
youngstown has been plagued by violent street fights in the recent past last may and august violence erupted on the streets of the city 
ryan called trumps infrastructure plan a bunch of smoke and mirrors he added that he didnt blame pelosi for focusing any specific economic issues i cant in good conscience hang this election around nancy pelosis neck of course but moving forward we have to win congressional seats in areas of the country that voted for donald trump even in my district where they voted for me and they voted for donald trump 
ryans campaign to replace pelsoi is picking up steam on sunday new york rep kathleen rice endorsed him stating he has a lot of good ideas but maybe most importantly he also isnt suggesting he has all the answers  he has stressed that he wants these conversations to be ongoing that he wants more voices in the conversation so that we can work together to craft our message and forge a winning strategy rice said in a statement

Infowars.com,shocking michele obama  hillary caught glamorizing date rape promoters,"most top retailers sell food produced with beekilling pesticides only aldi costco and whole foods got passing grades julie fidler  infowarscom  october   comments 
a new scorecard report gives a failing grade to  out of  major food retailers in the united states based on their policies and practices regarding pollinator protection organic options and pesticide reduction  source friends of the earth 
tiffany finckhaynes food futures campaigner with friends of the earth said 
us food retailers must take responsibility for how the products they sell are contributing to the bee crisis 
the majority of the food sold at top us food retailers is produced with pollinatortoxic pesticides we urge all major retailers to work with their suppliers to eliminate pollinatortoxic pesticides and to expand domestic organic offerings that protect pollinators people and the planet  organic offerings and transparency are lacking 
the report swarming the aisles rating top retailers on beefriendly and organic food is the work of a coalition led by friends of the earth and more than  farmer beekeeper farmworker environmental and public interest organizations  
the coalition sent a letter urging food retailers to eliminate pesticides that are toxic to bees and other pollinators  and increase us department of agriculture usda certified organic food and beverages to  of overall offerings by  the group would like to see retailers prioritize domestic regional and local producers 
friends of the earth and its allies have been successful in the past at convincing more than  garden retailers including lowes and home depot to commit to eliminate pollinatortoxic neonicotinoid neonic pesticides 
according to haynes the demand for organic foods has grown by doubledigits  but grocers arent keeping up she said 
a lot of the major food retailers have started to increase their organic offerings but few of them have really adopted clear goals or metrics to continue to significantly increase their organic food offerings in the future  
as evidenced by the groups research its difficult for the public to know where retailers stand concerning pesticide use and organic food eleven of the  retailers websites examined by friends of the earth dont provide basic information concerning their policies on organic food pollinators andor pesticides  haynes said adding 
theres a lot that retailers could do by adopting creative programs with their supply chain to help farmers grow their organic offerings and then be able to sell that in their stores americans are ready for change 
a yougov poll released  october  by friends of the earth and sumofus reveals that  of americans believe neonics should not be used in agriculture  and  of those who do the grocery shopping for their household would be more likely to shop at a store that has made a formal commitment to eliminate neonicotinoids  
additionally the poll shows that  of respondents believe its important for supermarkets to sell organic food another  said theyd likely spend more time at a different grocery store if it sold more organic food than the store they currently frequent 
said angus wong lead campaign strategist at sumofus a consumer watchdog with ten million members 
over  sumofus members have spoken out advocating that us hardware stores take action to protect our pollinators and after years of pressure home depot and lowes have finally enacted more beefriendly policies 
and the findings of this poll show that a vast majority of consumers want to eliminate neonicotinoids from their grocery stores too this is why food retailers must commit policies that protect our bees immediately 
only four of the nations top food retailers  albertsons costco target and whole foods  have adopted and made public a companywide commitment to increase offerings of certified organic food  they are also the only retailers to disclose data on the current percentage of organic food they offer or organic sales 
aldi food lion part of the delhaize group and kroger disclosed data on the current percentage of organic offerings or organic sales 
none of the retailers that the group looked at have publicly committed to sourcing organic food from american farmers  retailer apathy is killing pollinators 
of the top  food retailers surveyed by friends of the earth a shocking  were predominantly unresponsive to friends of the earths requests for information via surveys calls and letters the group was forced to turn to publicly available information including company websites company annual reports us securities and exchange commission filings corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports press coverage and industry analyses for their data 
we have bees to thank for every  in  bites of food we take  and without bees stores would run low on everything from strawberries to almonds source bee cause 
science increasingly points to neonicotinoid pesticides as a leading cause of pollinator decline glyphosate the main ingredient in monsantos blockbuster herbicide roundup has been shown to play a significant role in monarch butterfly declines  
several us cities have banned neonics including boulder city colorado  and portland oregon  this past spring maryland became the first state to ban the pesticides

Mike Rivero,color rev agit prop george soros moveon agitators march on america  as billionaire instigator sued,"st century wire says 
organized efforts are underway by democratic party affiliated ngos to try and somehow delegitimize the results of this weeks us presidential election 
on the eve of the us election before voters went to the polls wire political affairs analyst patrick henningsen accurately predicted this weeks unrest when he said  
if trump wins expect the likes of soros and moveonorg to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs who will protest riot smash and burn their way on to cnns  hour news rotation expect occupy  and blacklivesmatter to rage 
on friday henningsen talked to rt international about the postelections protests that were coordinated in part by democratic party community organizing online platform moveonorg  watch 
 not surprisingly moveonorg have also launched a national activist campaign to  abolish the electoral college  after democratic candidate hillary clinton came up short with  including new hampshire to donald trumps  including arizona and michigan final totals are not yet in but thus far  would be the fifth time in us history that a presidential candidate has won the white house while losing the total popular vote 
see also video female college students protesting because trump is a rapist 
wire associate editor shawn helton recently revealed more details about how the near exact same methods used in cia and sorosfunded color revolutions overseas  are now being deployed on us domestic shores by similar ngo front organizations has been the driving force behind nationwide protests against the election of donald trump 
overseas washington tends to use the same cast of ngo fronts to buildup prous political opposition groups as well as plan and generate civil unrest they include the albert einstein institute aei national endowment for democracy ned international republican institute iri national democratic institute ndi freedom house and later the international center for nonviolent conflict icnc and the us agency for international development usaid the financial and contractor arm of the department of state inside the us deep state actors in washington generally work through democratic party affiliated organizations like moveonorg as well as through labor union organizations like aflcio  and unite here  these along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests says helton 
helton also raised the question as to why president obama has stayed silent in the face of street protests opting instead to lead from behind he explains 
certainly judging by president obama and hillary clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest  one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots the political motivation is undeniable  to help delegitimize a new trump presidency

Daniel Haiphong,massachusetts is the next laboratory for school privatization and why it must be stopped,"professor dr mujahid kamran vicechancellor of the university of punjab on the suspension without pay of prof tony hall  shares
   
professor mike mahon president and vice chancellor lethbridge canada
dear professor mike mahon
it is with a sense of great sadness that i have learnt of the suspension without pay of professor anthony hall one of the most distinguished scholars not only of the  but a researcher and writer who is recognised and respected globally in a country like pakistan which is far behind canada in term of education research and scholarship no teacher or nonteacher of any university can be suspended without pay when someone is suspended he or she is entitled to draw full pay for the period of suspension if canada is doing better than us on various scales then one would expect that suspension without pay puts canada behind us in terms of due process and in terms of requirements demanded by the principles of justice and fair play i may add respectfully that in pakistani universities no one is generally suspended unless a fact finding committee has first looked into the matter thoroughly and found prima facie evidence of wrong doing the decision of the administration also destroys the concept of a tenured appointment
 from his writings that i have read over a period of time it is evident that professor anthony hall is a scholar whose work exposes the crimes and conspiracies of those who are taking the world headlong into a global war and simultaneously transforming it into a global slave state his analysis is impeccable and his grasp of facts masterly and his writings are devoid of any prejudice against any ethnic group or nation  or any university for that matter should have been proud to have professor hall on its faculty his suspension creates an impression even from this distance from where i write that certain powerful interests that aim destroying free speech have targeted people like professor anthony hall who speak out for democracy decency peace and justice
i have found out from the internet that bnai brithis behind this movement against shutting down free speech it is quite evident that the charge that professor anthony hall has created a discriminatory atmosphere is highly dubious to the contrary it appears that an antimuslim bias has been created in your institution by professor halls unfortunate suspensionthere is also a strong impression that bnai brith has taken over the administrative decision making at lethbridge
more suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere irish human rights activists against freedom of speech bnai brith attack on canadian professor has roots in zionist false flag tactics it is also worrying that bnai brith have now targeted canadian universities and canadian society if this is the case then the situation is disturbing not just for lethbridge and canada but for all freedom loving people worldwide when i was a young student at university of edinburgh scotland in the s i used to meet many canadian students and i found that they invariably stood for freedom of speech and for tolerance and justice the suspension of professor hall is inconsistent with my image of the canadian people that i had then formed
on behalf of the academic community of the university of the punjab established  i urge you to kindly reconsider your decision to suspend professor hall it will go a long way in rehabilitating the impression of people worldwide about the upholding of free speech academic freedom and genuine scholarly discourse at lethbridge

instead the billionaire candidate will establish his own white house outside of washington dc  as a matter of fact two of them  one in florida and another in nevada trumps white house s will be headquartered in the trump hotels in doral and las vegas

microsoft cofounder bill gates having a net worth of  billion and amazoncom ceo jeff bezos having a net worth of  billion are the nations two richest men they are at the top of the forbes  list of americas superrich individuals people who have net worths of billions of dollars many see the rich as a danger new york times columnist bob herbert wrote it doesnt really matter what ordinary people want the wealthy call the tune and the politicians dance his colleague paul krugman wrote on paper were a onepersononevote nation in reality were more than a bit of an oligarchy in which a handful of wealthy people dominate its sentiments like these that have led me to wish there were a humane way to get rid of the rich for without having the rich around to be whipping boys and distract our attention we might be able to concentrate on whats best for the  percent of the rest of us 
lets look at the power of the rich with all the money that gates bezos and other superrich people have what can they force you or me to do can they condemn our houses to create space so that another individual can build an auto dealership or a casino parking lot can they force us to pay money into the governmentrun  and doomed  obamacare program can they force us to bus our children to schools out of our neighborhood in the name of diversity can they force us to buy our sugar from a highcost domestic producer rather than from a lowcost caribbean producer the answer to all of these questions is a big fat no 
you say williams i dont understand let me be more explicit bill gates cannot order you to enroll your child in another school in order to promote racial diversity he has no power to condemn your house to make way for a casino parking lot unless our elected public officials grant them the power to rip us off rich people have little power to force us to do anything a lowly municipal clerk earning  a year has far more lifeanddeath power over us it is that type of person to whom we must turn for permission to build a house ply a trade open a restaurant and do myriad other activities its government people not rich people who have the power to coerce us and rip us off they have the power to make our lives miserable if we disobey this coercive power goes a long way toward explaining legalized political corruption 
take just one of thousands of examples the fanjuls are among the biggest sugar cane growers and they coown the worlds largest refining company american sugar refining which markets its product under the brand names domino ch redpath tate  lyle and florida crystals during the  election cycle florida crystals contributed more than  to candidates and political spending groups it spent more than  million lobbying congress the us departments of agriculture and commerce and the office of the us trade representative heres my question to you do you think it forked over all that money to help our elected representatives uphold and defend the us constitution nonsense the fanjuls and other sugar producers want congress to use tariffs to keep foreignproduced sugar out of our country so they can reap the financial benefits from being able to charge americans two to three times the world price of sugar 
so heres the ultimate question if some rich people can line the pockets of politicians to do their bidding at the expense of the rest of us whos to blame i think its we the people who are to blame for not using our votes to run such politicians out of town  and thats most of them but that might be deceitful of us for we also ask politicians to enable us to live at the expense of others",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,58,7,3711,671,4.503725782414307,671.0,-0.1210531164556349,-0.5778293249656962,0.1937200264745499,0.2739589587058666,-0.5777287453059136,0.2919614308175435,0.0014903129657228,0.0,0.0014903129657228,0,0,0.0,0.0026389904208854,0.8154,0.063,0.048,0.889,Positive,Very Strong

foreign ministers of iran russia and syria have started trilateral talks on a political solution to the syria crisis besides a serious fight against the takfiri terror groups operating in the arab country 
on friday iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif and his russian and syrian counterparts sergei lavrov and walid muallem gathered in moscow for a threeway meeting 
ahead of the meeting lavrov said the three nations are acting as a united front against terrorism saying their talks are mainly focused on ways of seriously tackling terrorism particularly in syria 
the three sides lavrov added will exchange views on humanitarian operations as well as efforts to stop the flow of weapons and military equipment to the foreignbacked militants operating against the damascus government 
prior to the threeway discussions zarif held a bilateral meeting with lavrov to discuss regional issues and the further enhancement of bilateral tehranmoscow ties russian foreign minister sergei lavrov r welcomes his iranian counterpart mohammad javad zarif during a meeting in moscow on october   photo by afp 
upon his arrival at vnukovo international airport in moscow on friday morning zarif said a political solution besides a serious fight against terrorism is the only way out of the crisis gripping syria 
unfortunately some countries have always pursued war and a military solution in syria this is while the solution to this crisis is of a political nature and also entails battles against takfiri groups said zarif 
he added we have always emphasized the need for the establishment of an allout ceasefire humanitarian operations and efforts to find a political solution to the syrian issue 
following the trilateral talks the three ministers attended a joint press conference 
during the presser muallem slammed the usled coalition purportedly fighting daesh saying the alliance has never been fighting terrorism despite its claims 
he said the washingtonled campaign was in fact encouraging daesh terrorists to move from iraqs mosul to syrias raqqah 
mosul and raqqah have served as the main daesh bases in the middle east over the past years iraqi and syrian armed forces are engaged in largescale military offensive to drive the terror group from the two cities 
the syrian foreign minister further said his country would continue cooperation with iran and russia in efforts to eradicate terrorism 
muallem described the atmosphere of the talks in russia as positive and very comfortable

zarif in turn described the talks in moscow as very productive saying iran and russia have developed very close relations in different areas 
commenting on the situation in syria the top iranian diplomat said syrias sovereignty and territorial integrity must be protected adding that it is up to the syrian nation to determine its own destiny and that the voice of the syrians must be recognized 
he further highlighted the need for a political settlement of the crisis adding that tehran backs the resumption of peace talks between the syrian government and opposition 
the iranian minister called for a ceasefire in syria joint battles against terror groups as well as efforts to facilitate aid delivery to syrian civilians in besieged areas 
he said the global community must unite in the battle against terrorism which poses a threat not only to syria but the entire world 
zarif added that supporting terrorism would serve the interest of no one warning that the terror groups would eventually bite the hands that feed them 
for his part the russian foreign minister also touched on the mosul battle in iraq saying that iraqi citys liberation from daesh would have a significant impact on the balance of power in neighboring syria 
lavrov said the political settlement in syria should be achieved through dialogue according to the security council resolutions welcoming syrias readiness to resume the stalled talks with the opposition 
referring to the situation in aleppo lavrov said terrorists blocked the exit routes opened as part of a syrian humanitarian pause and prevented the civilians from leaving the eastern neighborhoods of aleppo city 
the senior russian official also criticized the international organizations for failing to fulfill their duties towards the locals of eastern aleppo

a trump supporter sporting a hillary for prison tshirt chanted jews sa in support of his candidate during a rally in arizona on saturday 
the target was the pen of reporters who have been fodder for trumps rhetoric at every rally 
the context while the crowd was chanting usa one man chanted jews sa words like that cant be spun or read into the intent and meaning were obvious to everyone 
watch here on video obtained by the huffington post  
this sort of thing comes as no surprise considering that donald trump spent the last year spewing hate filled venom in every possible direction it may seem superfluous to restate every category of people for which trump has shown contempt but it is not 
muslims jews immigrants labor taxpayers latinos hispanics mexicans africanamericans women pows veterans people with disabilities gold star families and the military have felt the sting of trumps words and the disdain in his heart 
throughout this campaign season the vitriol against hillary clinton saw no limit signs and tshirts too disgusting to quote in this article chants of lock her up at the republican convention and since trump promised his base of thugs lowlifes and haters he would weaken the first amendment strengthen the second and establish the altright utopia 
hillary clinton was already the most qualified candidate in this race she also proved to have more stamina than any previous candidate needed not only was she competing against a vicious and pathological liar she was competing for who we are and who we could be for all the trump claims that the media is rigged in clintons favor it was trump who got free advertising who framed the narrative and whose words were the primary news stories of the campaign 
there is no doubt that hillary clinton will keep her promise to fight for us she has been doing it from the beginning of this campaign every time hillary clinton called out donald trumps sexist comments she was fighting for all women who were attacked humiliated and sexually abused by men like trump every time clinton shamed trumps horrific and disgusting comments about the khan family she was standing up for every gold star family she was also standing up for every muslimamerican the same is true every time clinton condemned trump for mocking a disabled reporter or resorted to altright stereotypes about africanamericans innercities and africanamerican communities 
every time trump spewed hate in whatever direction hillary clinton defended the target 
so no this isnt about choosing the lesser of two evils like every election this is about choosing our next president more importantly its about voting for who we are and who we aspire to be

Daisy Luther,if clinton goes down loretta lynch will go down with her,"michael snyder 
in the world of politics the coverup is often worse than the original crime it was his role in the watergate coverup that took down richard nixon and now hillary clintons coverup of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very very long time when news broke that the fbi has renewed its investigation into hillary clintons emails  it sent shockwaves throughout the political world  but this time around we arent just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i havent heard anyone talking about this but if the fbi discovers that hillary clinton altered destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the fbi during the original investigation she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political career and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life 
i have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice yet but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice  
whoever knowingly alters destroys mutilates conceals covers up falsified or makes a false entry in any record document or tangible object with the intent to impede obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title  or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than  years or both 
if hillary clinton is sent to prison for  years that would essentially be for the rest of her life 
i have a feeling that the fbi is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in huma abedins emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before november th because according to the wall street journal there are approximately  emails to search through 
as federal agents prepare to scour roughly  emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of hillary clinton s email use the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee 
metadata found on the laptop used by former rep anthony weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin a close clinton aide suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter it will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated from the time ms abedin served with mrs clinton at the state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the clinton email probe 
of those  emails an inside source told fox news that  at least   would be of interest to the investigation 
at this point fbi officials have not even begun searching through the emails because a search warrant has not been secured yet the following comes from cnn  
government lawyers havent yet approached abedins lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search sources earlier told cnn that those discussions had begun but the law enforcement officials now say they have not 
either way government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer the law enforcement officials said 
but the fbi is reportedly already searching a laptop that was coowned by anthony weiner and huma abedin and no warrant was necessary for that search because weiner is cooperating with the fbi 
many have been wondering why fbi director james comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big in addition comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the fbi the following is an excerpt from a daily mail article that was written by ed klein the author of a recently released new york times bestseller about the clintons entitled  guilty as sin  
the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week 
some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 
according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice 
he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom 
so what happens next 
in the most likely scenario the fbi will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge hillary clinton before the election this means that we would go into november th with this scandal hanging over the clinton campaign and that would seem to be very good news for donald trump 
however it is possible that once the fbi starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against clinton are warranted and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day 
in the unlikely event that does happen we could actually see hillary clinton forced out of the race before november th 
once again this appears to be very unlikely at this point but it is still possible 
if clinton was forced to step aside the democrats would need to come up with a new nominee and that process would take time in an article later today on the most important news i will reveal who i believe that nominee would be 
in such a scenario the democrats would desperately need time to get their act together and so we could actually see barack obama attempt to delay or suspend the election  the legality of such a move is highly questionable but barack obama has not allowed a little thing like the us constitution to stop him in the past 
this week is going to be exceedingly interesting  that is for sure 
the craziest election in modern american history just keeps getting crazier and i have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead 
it sure seems ironic that anthony weiner is playing such a central role this late in the story and i cant wait to see what is in store for the season finale

Hrafnkell Haraldsson,stung by clinton allegations trump claims he used no undocumented workers in dc hotel,"by reuters    pm democratic nominee hillary clinton leads republican donald trump by  percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks according to the reutersipsos states of the nation project   
by maurice tamman 
new york reuters  with  days to go before the us presidential election democratic nominee hillary clinton leads republican donald trump by  percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks according to the reutersipsos states of the nation project 
though data is not available for all early voting states clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as ohio and arizona and in republican party strongholds such as georgia and texas 
an estimated  million americans have voted so far in the election according to the university of floridas united states election project accounting for as much as  percent of the electorate 
overall clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the electoral college the reutersipsos survey showed 
having so many ballots locked down before the nov  election is good news for the clinton campaign on friday the federal bureau of investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to clintons close aide huma abedin those emails were found on a computer belonging to anthony weiner abedins estranged husband during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl the reutersipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged friday afternoon 
it remains unclear whether the fbi inquiry will upset the balance in the race the bureau disclosed nothing about the abedin emails including whether any of the messages were sent by or to clinton over the summer the fbi said it was closing its investigation into clintons use of a private email system while secretary of state until friday her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial fbi email probe 
clinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances trump has said none of the accusations are true he also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes 
as of thursday clintons odds of receiving the  electoral college votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than  percent according to state of the nation polling results released saturday the project estimated she would win by  votes to  with  votes solidly for the democrat 
clintons lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by president barack obama over republican mitt romney at this point of the  race according to a reutersipsos poll taken at the time obama won the election by  electoral votes to romneys  
but even before the latest email news it had been a difficult week for clinton news coverage of trumps accusers had diminished while clinton confronted the almost daily release by wikileaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign managers account this weeks leaked messages raised questions about former president bill clintons finances 
and her lead in the states of the nation project fell slightly from last week though the projected electoral college votes hardly moved the number of states solidly for clinton slid from  to  this week trump didnt see any additional states tilt solidly to him but he did see some gains the swing states of pennsylvania colorado iowa and nevada all moved from leaning to clinton to being too close to call 
still trumps path to a victory is narrow and any realistic chance rests on his winning ohio north carolina and florida as of thursday ohio remained a tossup florida and north carolina were still tilting toward clinton according to the states of the nation results 
early voting data for florida and north carolina was not yet available this week in ohio clinton led trump by double digits among early voters the projects broader polling suggests the state is deadlocked between the two candidates 
in arizona clinton also was solidly ahead among early voters in the past month arizona has gradually moved from a solid trump state to a marginal clinton state although it is still too close to call according to the project results 
in georgia she enjoyed a similar lead among early voters overall georgia leans to trump but his lead narrowed to five percentage points this week down from eights points last week and  points a month ago 
even in texas where trump enjoys a sizable lead clinton has a doubledigit edge among early voters according to project results 
the states of the nation project is a survey of about  people every week in all  states plus washington dc state by state results are available by visiting httpwwwreuterscomstatesofthenation

Bruce Thornton,how trump happened,"force and fanaticism  wahhabism in saudi arabia and beyond is wahhabism a complete distortion of islam november   raymond ibrahim 
note in what follows shillman fellow raymond ibrahim reviews force and fanaticism wahhabism in saudi arabia and beyond by simon ross valentine a shorter version of the book review first appeared in the middle east quarterly fall  vol  no  
valentine a british methodist pastor and teacher who taught in saudi arabia has written a useful book about the desert kingdom most interesting is its exploration of how the monarchy is the single greatest force in spreading islamic fundamentalism it has spent as much as  billion to spread wahhabism in the west yet america and britain have been and are continuing to be implicit supporters of wahhabism 
valentine discusses the background of how this unholy alliance came about he warns if the west simply ignores it saudi arabias role in international terrorism seems likely to worsen rather than conveniently disappear this is troubling considering that isis is saudi arabias latest monstrous contribution to world history 
the author explores important topics including the mutawwa  or religious police and provides useful historical context discussing the origins of wahhabism its alliance with the house of saud and the oil discoveries that changed everything 
the books primary defect is standard valentine regularly insists that it is of the greatest importance to distinguish between wahhabism and islam generally anything good positive tolerant and peaceful is ascribed to islam anything bad negative intolerant and violentmisogyny draconian punishments execution of apostates intolerance for and discrimination against nonmuslimsis ascribed to wahhabism 
this position appears to be based on the authors own cultural presuppositions thus he felt confused and puzzled to hear of wahhabi intolerance including the attempt to propagate their beliefs by force prompting him to wonder can you force someone to love god in all the conversations i had with ulema imams mutawa religious police and saudis generally there was never a mention of love the idea that god loved me just frightful talk of hell burning and future pain if i did not believe and accept the wahhabi faith 
had valentine engaged in a critical reading of islamic doctrine and historyas opposed to projecting his christian notion of god onto islamhe wouldve known that muhammad followed by countless caliphs and sultans throughout the centuries did propagate their beliefs by force the overwhelming majority of todays muslim world was taken from nonmuslims by force and that although islam attributes  characteristics to god love is not one of them 
valentines readers wouldve benefit much more had he simply laid out his useful information concerning the inner workings of the saudi regime and its unholy alliance with the west without trying to tackle the deeper question of what islam really isleading to yet another book marred by islamic apologetics",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,83.52880693399604,18,3,2999,468,5.3739316239316235,468.0,-1.3440546901789416,-1.3294321861387173,0.0053449977775119,-0.0442802416770845,0.2810790786175264,-0.0337180772337962,0.0021367521367521,0.0,0.0021367521367521,0,0,0.0,0.0037836807102866,0.9729,0.137,0.094,0.769,Positive,Very Strong

Scott,russia celebrates a unity day of liberation of moscow from the polish roman papists army in,"after the release of a wikileaks email chain from march  on tuesday in which a top clinton aide admitted president barack obama falsely claimed he did not know about hillary clintons private server use while she was secretary of state white house press secretary josh earnest sprung into action to deny that the president had lied about the issue
what the president said was an entirely factual response earnest said to a group of reporters in los angeles where obama was attending democratic fundraisers
earnest then attempted to explain away all criticism of the presidents actions as mere conspiracies
 
related stories hannity proposes a sendoff for obama in the event of a trump presidency wikileaks podesta said obamas dont need to be this nice to president bush and first lady wikileaks reveals obama knew about clintons emails clean this up i recognize that some of the presidents critics have attempted to construct some type of conspiracy about the communication between the president and the secretary of state he said
he continued but theyve failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny so i guess they are back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies
obama himself denied any knowledge of the server telling cbs reporter bill plante in march  just after the server revelations that he learned of the clintons private email server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports
 
several days after the server revelations in march  earnest told the press that obama knew about clintons email address and had sent messages to it but knew nothing about a private server
he reiterated that position on tuesday
the president did trade emails with secretary clinton not a large number of them earnest said
of course the president had possession of secretary clintons email address but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook independent voters push trump to the front in florida and ohio rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias however the wikileaks email chain  which earnest referred to as stolen and therefore illegitimate  tells a different story with top clinton aides seemingly in a panic that it could come to light that the president was lying when he said he did not know about clintons private server
looks like potus just said he found out hrc was using her personal email when he saw it in the news clinton spokesman josh schwerin said in a march   email published tuesday by wikileaks

 john podesta kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 

 podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show 

 both were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 

 kadzik lobbied podesta  then wh chief of staff  to pardon his billionaire tax dodger fugitive client marc rich whose wife gave  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon fbi director james comey is now trying to do the right thing and correct the deed cleaning up the mud he and hillary clinton put all over the face of fbi agency by reopening hillary clintons case thanks to kemails linked to sex scandal of huma abedins husband anthony weiner and the mutiny of fbi agents who wont put up with comeys crap we are suppose to finally get justice 

but guess what doj assigned a clinton ally and john podestas very close friend peter kadzik to take charge of the new investigation 

in a letter to congress the doj writes that it will continue to work closely with the fbi and together dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible assistant attorney general peter j kadzik writes in letters to house and senate lawmakers 

who is peter kadzik 

according to an excellent article published by daily caller 

the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta the democrats campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik a top official at the justice department 

the dinner arrangement revealed in hacked podesta emails released by wikileaks is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices 


podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 

the postbenghazi dinner was attended by podesta kadzik superlobbyist vincent roberti and other wellplaced beltway fixtures 

kadzik who started at the doj in  helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president 

in the trenches 

podesta and kadzik have a long history  one which has largely gone unnoticed during the ongoing clinton email scandal 

kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office 

that history is cited by podesta in another email hacked from his gmail account 

in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign 

podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 

podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal 

kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon 

to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   

a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta 

the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon 

on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library

if his campaign is any indication donald trumps presidency will usher in drastic regressive changes to immigration health care and womens rights in america in response angela bubash a woman who appears to be slightly misinformed about just what is likely to happen is rushing to stockpile enough deodorant to last her the next four years 
well it seems like some wires got crossed somewhere but okay way to take action angela 
in the days since trumps victory shes cleaned out the deodorant inventories of multiple omahaarea grocery stores apparently under the impression that deodorant will soon become much more difficult to acquire than it is now with the prospect of a menacing new world looming angela is taking some seemingly misguided precautions and buying up all the stick gel rollon and spray deodorant she can ahead of trumps inauguration ceremony on january

shirt with a lizard on it these robot street performers have not been any help at all  the weather was nice so i took my son to the boardwalk to walk around and watch the street performers we were in line to get pretzels when he ran off to chase after a pigeon and i lost him in the crowd i looked around the area and couldnt find him anywhere so i ran up to one of those robot streetperformer guys that i know my son loves to watch and asked him if he had seen a small boy with a lizard shirt on the guy turned to me and just started robotically dancing to funkytown no matter how much i implored him to stop dancing to funkytown and tell me if hed seen my son he refused to break character for even a goddamn second this was extremely upsetting to me but i didnt have time to dwell on it i ran off in search of my son  the next robot street performer i asked about my son was doing the thing where they pretend to be in off mode and wouldnt even look me in the eye as i begged him to help me find my little boy but i was really starting to worry about my son so i played along and threw a dollar in his tip bucket hoping that would make him turn on but that didnt make him turn on so i threw  in his bucket and that didnt make him turn on either finally i put a  in the bucket and he whirred to life blowing on his weird whirling whistle thing but he still wouldnt tell me if he had seen my son he just kept blowing on that stupid fucking whistle of his thats all he did whistle and whistle and whistle  at this point it had been  minutes or so since i lost track of my son so i was officially in panic mode i went up to yet another one of the boardwalks many robot street performers and asked him if he had seen my son i even took out a picture of him to show the guy he looked at the picture and studied it for a moment and im elated because unlike the other ones he actually seemed like he might help me but then he took the picture of my son put it in his mouth and pretended to robotically print it out of his mouth like a ticket or something so i grabbed the picture and started to walk away when the son of a bitch took me by the hand and offered me a metallic rose this piece of shit was incorporating me into his whole goddamn act and by the way the crowd was loving it they were eating it up so i threw his stupid metallic rose on the ground and asked him again if hed seen my son and he just started doing a robotic version of the beatingheart thing that mimes do by then i was just crying because i was so worried about my son and the motherfucker offered me a metallic handkerchief a metallic fucking handkerchief i swear to god  when i went up to this robot street performer he was smoking a cigarette and looking at his phone clearly on a break finally i thought this man will help me find my son but when i asked him if he had seen my boy he actually went back into character and started smoking his cigarette all robotically what a nightmare  i really couldve used some comfort and assistance when i approached this robot street performer and asked him if he had seen my son instead i got a dance battle between him one of those tree guys and a couple of statue men all of them refused to acknowledge me including the statue men who honestly shouldnt have even been dancing because their whole thing is supposed to be that theyre statues but they did dance and they were really good the whole group was really good at dancing and they wouldnt stop for a second to help a distraught mother find her child disgusting  as soon as i asked this robot performer if he had seen my son anywhere he pointed his robot finger at a little boy in the front row i told him that was not my son and described him to the guy the guy then pointed at the boy again again i told him this was not my child he then started robot dancing around the boy pointing to him over and over and over again the boy was loving the attention but i was infuriated fed up with the robot street performers i turned to the little boy and asked him if he had seen a little boy about his age running around here on his own the little boy looked up at me considering the question then one of these

Jon Anthony,examples that show the globalists are losing ground,"home  badge abuse  community outraged after video shows a cop throwing down a yo girl community outraged after video shows a cop throwing down a yo girl matt agorist september    comments 
asheville nc  a video posted to facebook this week has the internet in an uproar as it shows an asheville police officer allegedly assaulting a yearold girl 
the video shows a short interaction between yearold kacee fleming and officer shalin oza according to cherrell mooney the woman who took the video fleming approached police as they were arresting her brother dominic fore according to apd they had a warrant for fores arrest 
she was asking them why are yall arresting my brother mooney said the officer was being rude they didnt want to talk to them 
the video apparently shows the aftermath of this questioning as the officer grabs fleming and throws her to the ground 
according to police fleming yelled at officers and allegedly reached into her brothers pockets to retrieve his personal items as he was being arrested flemings actions then caused officers to have to deal with her the video is the result of fleming apparently being dealt with 
according to police fleming was arrested and charged as an adult for resisting obstructing or delaying an officer sgt noland brown who was on the scene also told news  that she is charged with misdemeanor assault on a government official 
i have no trust in the police anymore said crystal fleming  kasees mother according to news  she says her daughter was trying to communicate with police before the incident to tell them that fore had just gotten out of the icu 
she is not trying to be disrespectful said crystal fleming but yall are not listening they were not listening 
you wonder why people are running around here saying black lives matter she continues thats why because they really dont think our lives matter because he could have pulled her to the side talked to her he didnt even do none of that 
according to police they were there for another incident but when they saw fore they decided to arrest him too 
the asheville police department released the following statement 
the asheville police department has viewed the video circulating on social media regarding the arrest of a yearold female on the evening of september   
the nine second video is only a small portion of a much longer incident 
the asheville police department is in the process of conducting a full administrative investigation that will review all evidence including the video circulating on social media and body worn camera footage in our review 
the asheville police department is dedicated to providing the best possible police service and upon completion of the review will take appropriate action if deemed necessary 
anyone with additional video footage or information regarding this incident is encouraged to contact our professional standards office at   
according to news  when they requested the body cam video from the scene that night they were denied matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist on twitter and now on steemit share google  keysbum 
ooooh the adrenaline rush that brave heroic cop must have enjoyed after overpowering that dangerous villainous little girl he can proudly puff his chest out after that one nishi 
the disturbing thing is that they actually do that they feel good about doing this kind of thing they are convinced that what they are doing is morally just and necessary reminds me of hobbesto this war of every man against every man this also is consequent that nothing can be unjust the notions of right and wrong justice and injustice have there no place where there is no common power there is no law where no law no injustice force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues jonathan sabo 
this is not about black  it is about getting involved in a legal arrest  razedbywolvs 
no its about black because if it wasnt white people might get pissed enough to do something about it that would not work out to well for the officers involved in legal arrests james michael 
she had every right to require he state why he was being arrested and the officer had no lawful arrest she also had every right to free the man from being kidnapped by a traitor you retard 
now why was he being arrested bruismenot 
what a lovely mouth that mother has no wonder the kid has no respect for the law also it looks like the kid was resisting including standingsteppingstomping on the cops left foot oh well gininitaly 
i looked at that video  times and never saw her stomp on his precious foot she was  and hardly lbs soaking wet youre telling me that a big adult male couldnt contain her threat without shoving her to the ground bruismenot 
unfortunately cops arent psychic and they have to react quickly to protect themselves the girl was obviously highly emotional when she approached the situation one of the most dangerous times to interfere with police activity is during the arrest of a family member 
its easy to sit back and criticize the cop but he doesnt know her intent nor if in the dim light shes carrying a weapon of some sort you cant just go stomping up on an arrest situation ignoring orders to stay back 
have you ever fought an emotionally charged  year old girl they fight like wild cats just watch a video on you tube some time if you havent age doesnt always matter and  year olds are adult sized 
cops dont put on the uniform to get hurt teach your children to respect the law show respect yourself and you wont have to worry about adult sized teenagers being thrown down by big mean cops 
also maybe your device is better than mine but it looks to me like the girls foot lands on his left foot i could be wrong in that ill look at it again gininitaly 
hogwash spoken like a cop of today who needs an excuse to brutalize for profit or the pleasure of being a bully against the defenseless 
lumberjacks farmers emts firemen and fishermen have more dangerous jobs than cops and i happen to be old enough to see my towns  years of service police chief retire without ever having fired a shot at a human being and that was  yrs of drunks with guns broken bottles or knives belligerent mouthy kids family disputes and all the rest so whats the difference between then and now his talent and yours attitude and the desire to deescalate situations not intensify them to the point of murder 
since  and the patriot act they seem to have been given permission to make us citizens their victims instead of their friends family and neighbors that they were once supposed to protect and serve 
you will get no get out of jail free or pity cards from me cops today or rather whats left after the good cops get fed up and quit or were drummed off the force because those that remain are drunk on their own power over people and revel in the violence that they create 
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxfaif_a_e bruismenot 
i didnt say the cop did a great job i didnt say that i would have reacted the same way i didnt say that i thought the video looked fine i was simply trying to give an explanation for what we saw on the video gininitaly 
and just who gave you that job or why you thought that cop needed defending you invented an aggression by that  yr old complained about language defended the cop no matter what the video actually showed and projected your prejudices onto the entire situation in my book that makes you a worthless witness who deals in fantasy not fact no different than a lot of chicken chit americans who think defending the police or government will get you a free ticket off of the auschwitz express you should never defend the indefensible 
all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men to do nothing bruismenot 
i take it we cant be friends then stir up the sjws all day long if you must who does anyone call if they get jacked shot stabbed or whatever next time you are the victim of a real crime go ahead and call those same sjws to save your bacon see how many show up and how far you get 
lady dont assume you know me you dont know my story if you didwe might could be friends gininitaly 
i have no idea what a sjw is is that police jargon i know one thing i wouldnt be calling an american cop theyd end up shooting my dog my kid or me if they even managed to make it to the right address in some steroid induced adrenaline rush i dont need those kinds of jacked up people in my life youtheyve lost all credibility as anything that could or would help id ask a bystander for assistance before calling a cop any day 
your words are quite indicative of where your loyalties lie and if you think im assuming then you should come clean and tell your story and at that point i might reevaluate my take on who you are and why you seem to need to defend the indefensible in what used to be the formerly free usa 
httpkilledbypolicenet free_willey 
your explanation is bogus and it clearly indicates that you are the problem the cop should have been arrested on the spot for assault this is what makes all cops criminals they fail to arrest and charge crimes against their buddies in blue you included it astounds me that you guys continue to make your job on a daily basis more and more dangerous putrid ignorance and arrogance and a complete non caring attitude for people in general is what is on display at todays pds this is not the service that we hired you for cops work an entire lifetime to avoid disdain for the people they have sworn to serve only to have pds hire the lowest of iq and then train them to see the public as the enemy once you start to justify the violent actions of todays cops you need to leave the force furthermore you do not have to be a psychic as you claim to see that the cop simply became upset lost control and used violence to assault this less than  lb person bruismenot 
sure arrest all the cops then whose going to keep all the people safe who dont have or know how to defend themselves from the predators in the world 
what would you do james michael 
kops have no duty to keep anyone safe moronlook up the hundreds of citesstating exactly that james michael 
if you have respect for xops these days you either have your head up your ass or are stupid badcopwatch 
this cop should be taught a lesson bruismenot 
why for doing his job and just what lesson would you have him taught do you know him his training or his history if so please enlighten us elropo 
his job my ass i am in complete agreement with gininitaly in my town we have the same situations with no brutality from the police they are pretty much respected here some rare exceptions it all depends on the mayor chief council hiring policies and just whether they keep assholes on the job gininitaly 
thx and glad to see that you are blessed with a rational community good to know there are a few left out there  bruismenot 
ok so you can tell this cop is an ass hole from this short clip you can tell that this upset girl is an angel bravo for you then bravo for you 
fine now ive wasted enough time on here time to go to work peace james michael 
she asked why her brother was being kidnapped the cop is required to inform her whyor it is unlawfulwe the people she is onehim sworn servantmoron haauwnk 
you need to be strung up for fellating pigs its against your religion james michael 
the nzis were doing their jobs committing treason and murder also moron ibcamn 
cops are such cowards and pussysstep on my feet and im gonna arrest yallcowardscops only feel like real men when they are beating up womenall cops are just plain criminals gina 
you all make me sick the problem today is that we raise children to disrespect authority and then feel we can call moral high ground against those that are in place to help 
our youth need to be taught that they are not able to do whatever they want they need to understand that laws apply to them and if not followed prepare for consequences 
the point of no return that i see in this video is a  year old female that feels she has the right to interfere in an arrest in progress 
and before anyone touts unlawful bull it is clearly stated that a warrant was in place for the arrest and as such she was wrong for interfering 
mom is equally to blame filming it hoping to make a quick buck or news scandal instead of correcting her daughter for her behaviour ibcamn 
so is what your saying is bow down to these retarded criminals and follow orders without question and raise our children to be just like you and never question authority and be a slavesucks to be you stopkingobama 
heres an idea dont interfere with the cops when they are trying to arrest someone you fucking creampuff libtard crybabies just dont get it fucking morons think they can adjudicate a case in the streets while the arrest is taking place try protesting real abuse instead of cases like these where morons get what they deserve for being stupid james michael 
you have the right and the duty to stop any sworn servant unlawfully arresting someonethat is an act called aggravated kidnapping and is an act of treason stopkingobama 
you have the right to resist an unlawful arrest they had a warrant for her idiot brothers arrest even resisting an unlawful arrest is a good way to get killed let them cuff you and if they were acting as egregiously as you think they were tell it to the judge if you have video to support your probably unfounded claim all the better 
all you fucking limpwristed cream puff milquetoast libtard cophating social justice warriors with no respect for law and order should just be rounded up and shot or at least sent to iran it would make this country a hell of a lot better off james michael 
resisting and obstructing are non sequiturs for we have nothing because there can be no resisting or obstructing without a real charge to resist or obstructanother aggravated assault and battery kidnapping false imprisonment by a another traitor felon with a badge ten thousand videos of the same exact thing on youtube alonedallas was deserved no cop can be trusted social trending breaking podesta told mills dump all those emails on day news of clintons private email server broke november  ",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,72.91704389050463,51,8,14482,2599,4.534436321662178,2599.0,-0.3350783918572136,-0.3899286096724409,3.043421478856287,3.296447521948871,-0.5474204548708684,3.3851145910292835,0.0011542901115813,0.0,0.0,0,3,0.0,0.0028591380667169,-0.9997,0.111,0.174,0.715,Negative,Very Strong

 of nations top economists have come together to urge the american people not to elect donald trump to be the next president of the united states 
in the letter  the economists listed a dozen economic policy reasons why voters should not vote for trump but it as their conclusion that was stunning he promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy optionsdonald trump is a dangerous destructive choice for the country he misinforms the electorate degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality if elected he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions and to the prosperity of the country for these reasons we strongly recommend that you do not vote for donald trump 
trumps thoughts on the economy are dangerous to the prosperity of the country it isnt just that trump is a person of bad character who lacks any of the human traits that voters should seek in a president it is also that his policies are nonsense 
economists dont write these types of letters ever the economists arent discussing partisan politics they view trump and his ideas as a threat to the american economy

No Author,trump the president what does that mean for the world  countercurrentsorg,"napm condemns state and expert apathy on deaths of hundreds of adivasi children in malkangiri demands immediate medical relief and justice 
apex court must intervene urgently state must declare medical emergency 
rd nov  the national alliance of peoples movements is extremely pained and concerned about the rising number of deaths of adivasi children in the tribal district of malkangiri orissa due to outbreak of japanese encephalitis je while the deaths have crossed the unpardonable mark of  the govt as usual continues to undercut the number to less than the half of the actual deaths even taking the official figure of  deaths it an extremely serious case and calls for an urgent comprehensive action in a situation when state apathy and delay have been primary reasons for these avoidable deaths on such a large scale 
we are indeed shocked that the team of experts sent by the centre has tried to absolve the government of all responsibility by attributing the deaths to consumption of some local seeds bana chakundi and not to je and governmental delay thereby blaming the adivasis themselves for the deaths when as per the orissa govts statistics itself  cases are confirmed je there out to have been remedial medical response on a warfooting considering the seriousness of je which can be fatal or can lead to lifelong intellectual behavioral or neurological impairments in many cases it is also a serious question as to why the govt did not ensure timely incorporation of je immunization in the public health delivery as per who standards and remained in denial mode the extremely casual response of the medical department state govt and now even the centre through this expert team only demonstrates that even in this time of crisis the concern is more their onus and image than the life of the children 
public health expert dr sylvia karpagam in her reasoned counter to the centres report questions that when the socalled toxic seeds are consumed all round the year and by all families in the tribal region since generations it is intriguing as to why this epidemic erupts here only on children and why now one likely reason might be that the presence of je in the already malnourished children could have been aggravated by the consumption of the seeds in some cases but for the central team to take a generalized and extrapolated position on the basis of only  urine samples out of  official admitted death is certainly not a scientific way of medical research or does it appear convincing in the present circumstances many other experts as well have questioned the central teams unilateral conclusions merely on the basis of toxicity in the urine samples especially since je cases and deaths have been reported across the district even in the malkangiri town 
it is also pertinent to note that the expert team has remained completely silent on the crucial role or failure of the anganwadis and icds monitoring system in the state in providing nutritional and health support to children in the tribal areas this is despite the fact that the apex court has time and again attached highest priority to ensure health and nutrition in all the tribal tracts and hamlets across the country in the form of hot cooked meals this situation is clearly in violation of the orders of the supreme court in the right to food case civil writ petition no  in fact one has to only go through the fact finding reports by right to food campaign in malkangiri districts conducted in  as well as  the abysmal situation of public health infrastructure and food distribution systems are one of the main reasons behind the regular outbreak of je disease the rampant malnutrition under staffed public health institutions abysmal health infrastructure are providing the perfect breeding ground for outbreak and spread of the disease it is indeed ironical that while on the one hand the union ministry of women and child welfare is pushing for packaged foods and gearing up to sign corporate mous in violation of scs norms on the other the anganwadis and icds servises in many areas of malkangiri or elsewhere especially in tribal areas seem to be utter disarray 
in the light of this serious situation napm calls upon the centre and state to declare this as a medical emergency and ensure anti jeimmunization and other medical relief on a warfooting demands an independent enquiry into this crisis by a multimember team comprising of renowned public health professions independent health activists and doctors 
calls upon the national commission for scheduled tribes ncst and the national commission for protection of child rights ncpcr to immediately take cognizance of the situation and their team including commission members and medical experts to investigate the causes recommend immediate measures and speed up action on the ground 
calls upon the governor of orissa to make an immediate visit to the affected areas as the constitutional custodian of peace and good government for the tribal areas and ensure relief and justice to the adivasi children and families

top nato  eu officials expressed anger at spains permit reportedly issued to a russian aircraft carrier group to take on fuel and supplies at ceuta a city with unclear political status spain says russias warships have been mooring there for years 
a barrage of harsh statements followed when spanish media reported that russias naval battle group led by aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov would make a stopover at the autonomous port of ceuta after passing the straits of gibraltar on wednesday 
battle stations putins fearsome fleet locked loaded  ready for war with britain or not 
russian ships would moor in ceuta to take on fuel and supplies under a permit issued by spains foreign ministry spanish newspaper abc reported on tuesday also citing defense minister pedro morenes who said that there was a prior authorization for this particular case 
guy verhofstadt former belgian prime minister and currently eu envoy for brexit talks with the uk expressed his outrage calling spains decision the harassment of eu and nato forces 
in a facebook post he said that nato member spain provides assistance to a fleet which has one purpose adding that only last week this spanish government signed up to a statement from the european council accusing russia of war crimes against civilians in aleppo 
later in the day nato secretary general jens stoltenberg made it clear that the bloc wants madrid to rethink the stopover permit a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
we are concerned and i have expressed that very clearly about potential use of this battle group to increase russias ability and to be a platform for airstrikes against syria he said 
this is something i have conveyed very clearly before and i repeat those concerns today and i believe that all nato allies are aware that this battle group can be used to conduct airstrikes against aleppo and syria 
he then downplayed the rhetoric noting that its for each nation to decide whether these ships can get supplies and be fuelled in different harbors along the route towards the eastern mediterranean 
late tuesday night the spanish foreign ministry said it was reviewing the decision the latest stopover requests are being reviewed at the moment based on the information we are receiving from our allies and from russian authorities the ministry said in a statement quoted by reuters 
earlier in the day however the ministry told ria novosti that madrid allows russian ships to dock in spanish ports as routine navigation which effectively lies outside eu sanctions imposed on moscow 
in the meantime a spokesman for the foreign ministry told the telegraph the requests from the russian navy are considered on casebycase basis stressing that russian navy vessels have been making calls in spanish ports for years 
ceuta an autonomous spanish enclave on the tip of africas northern coast lies along the straits of gibraltar and borders morocco which also claims the territory as its own 
although ceuta is part of the eu its status within nato is still unresolved since  spain has rankled the bloc by allowing  russian warships to refuel at the enclave 
the mission of the admiral kuznetsov carrier group has already triggered a media frenzy across europe with british norwegian and dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the russian warships as they round european shores through international waters 
once they reach syrian shores the ships will provide backup for russias naval standing group already deployed to the area according to the russian defense ministry this article was posted wednesday october   at  am share this article",presstv.ir,Real,english,99.2,47.88118811881188,63,10,3627,601,4.993344425956739,601.0,0.0318220802597783,-0.0141271790859303,0.1714960062350117,0.1642213034014007,-0.0945231613490804,0.1796581521791505,0.0016638935108153,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0041214086718787,-0.9716,0.05,0.087,0.862,Negative,Very Strong

kimberly kovax an yearold girl from allentown pa has been interested in politics and government from a very young age and she followed the historic campaign of hillary clinton closely but when hillary lost on tuesday that meant something incredible for kimberly she still gets to dream of being the first female president 
wow this must be a truly special moment for kimberly 
the moment hillary clinton made her concession speech wednesday morning kimberlys opportunity to become the first woman elected to the oval office opened right back up though it may not be for   maybe even  years this key milestone in feminism is all kimberlys to aspire toward 
some may say that another woman will be elected the first female president in the three decades before kimberlys even eligible to run but if the  election is any indication it looks like she is still very much in the running to break the gender barrier in the oval office who knows kimberly could even be the first female president to relegalize abortion if roe v wade is overturned at some point in the next four years 
it must feel truly incredible for girls in america to see that this huge accomplishment is still on the table theirs for the eventual taking the fact that americas ugliest most intolerant tendencies prevailed over clinton means millions of girls can still envisage themselves as the one to make that landmark feminist achievement and it doesnt get more powerful than that

admin,britain joins biggest european military buildup since cold war,"many older physical trainers and even those younger ones who were proteges of the older men will tell the trainee that there is an inverse correlation between strength and speedthat being too big and muscular will slow down an athlete for whatever reason i have found that this is most prevalent amongst traditional martial artists the usual reason given is that the increased mass is simply a dead weight while those with a little bit more knowledge will explain that lifting will develop slow twitch muscles over the fast twitch muscles needed for sprinting jumping punching and kicking
i am here to tell you that the common wisdom is completely wrongwhen done properly weightlifting will not impede your speed and will in fact enhance your speed and explosiveness
anecdotes perhaps youve heard of this man

that is of course jamaicas usain bolt the fastest man in the world and holder of multiple olympic records also worth noting is that in an interview mr bolt revealed that he squats  pounds and at least partially attributes his nigh inhuman speed to his training regimen and hes not the only speed athlete who this can be said oflook at any olympic class sprinter they are all quite muscular fellows

similarly other athletic disciplines thats athletics in the specific rather than general sense im using the european term for what my countrymen call track and field have claimed to utilize weightlifting in their training such as the long jump and the hurdles or you can take my word for it at my best i had a one rep max squat of  pounds and had a  inch vertical leap i am judging this by my ability to perform a standing jump over ndhighest position hurdles which are measured at  inches 
in fact many worldlevel athletes of all disciplines are utilizing olympic style weightlifting to develop speed and powe r
anyway you slice it compound weight training is a fantastic supplement to all athletes even those who seemingly dont need that raw brute strength
the science as i elaborated in this article  as well as in the free pdf i offer to subscribers to my website the subscription signup is on the front page theres more than one type of way to be athletic more accurately there are three speaking purely in terms of muscular andor nervous system function so this does not include handtoeye coordination or other skills related to team sports these three things can loosely correlate to the three types of muscle fibersredor slowoxidative fast glycolyticor white and fast oxidative rather than rehash an article that ive already written we will focus on the white muscle the fast glycolytic this is the type of muscle you want to be training for if you want to develop sprinting speed or a high vertical leap
or to put this into terms of newtons second law of motion accelerationforcemass ie the amount of muscular force you can exert divided by your body weighthow fast you can accelerate and yes i am aware that theres probably a more mathematically accurate way of putting this
which exercises to do it is at this point that youre probably asking which exercises you should train to develop those physical skills you desire if you read my articles regularly you will know what i am likely to saycompound free weight lifting
in fact ill go out on a limb and say if you dont know which exercise you should do to develop a certain physical trait you should always default to a compound lift unless you receive some further information that says otherwise training for speed or vertical leap is no exception to this rule
if you are looking for sheer running speed and leaping ability the power lifts that hit the lower body are most effective deep ass to grass squats deadlifts and the clean and jerk are used by professional athletes to great effect

similarly if you want the ability to throw a ball or punch harder upper body compound lifts are the key bench presses overhead presses and yes the clean and jerk will see you through

so for those of you who are afraid that your athletic performance will be somehow impeded by heavy weightlifting nothing could be further from the truth

over the past year a few highprofile court cases involving rape have spurred an intense national discussion on the topic whether it was brock turner a stanford swimmer who was sentenced to six months in a county jail for his rape of an unconscious woman or owen labrie a student at an elite prep school who raped a yearold classmate but was arraigned on lesser charges our justice system has tried to convict rapists with varying degrees of success as a father i look at these cases and i cant help but worry for my children in times like these we must take a stand and we must teach our sons that being brought to trial and then convicted of rape is simply utterly wrong 
our children and more specifically our boys need to know that they should never under any circumstances be put in a situation where they could potentially lose a case accusing them of sexual assault my son knows that and every parent should make an effort to teach their boys the same 
whether they made the vile unforgivable mistake of having a bad lawyer calling an unreliable witness or openly admitting to their crime to an undecided jury americas youth must understand that being convicted of rape should never ever happen going to court for sexual assault is one thing but being declared guilty is quite another and as responsible parents we need to do everything in our power to ensure that no child crosses that line no questions asked 
bottom line we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape not now not ever 
i dont care who you areif you have a son you need to teach him that being convicted of rape even just one time is unforgivable the truth is the moment your boy loses a rape trial is the moment that lives are ruined and theres absolutely no taking that back 
as a father of a young man myself i would not be able to live with myself if he someday went to jail just because of something as easily preventable as a sexual assault conviction when i look into my yearold callums eyes the last thing i want to think about is my little guy becoming the type of man who cant somehow weasel his way out of a highprofile court case in front of all his friends family and the public at large 
bottom line we need to do a better job at showing our sons that there is no worse mistake a young man can make than being declared guilty of rape not now not ever because if we want this generation of boys to grow into men that we truly take pride in we have to start teaching them that any young man who gets punished for rape brings shame not only to himself but also to his gender and this country as a whole 
so please dont wait please talk to your son today about his responsibility to never be convicted of rape and to speak up if he ever sees someone else in danger of being convicted of rape our future depends on it",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,93,18,2895,549,4.260473588342441,549.0,0.9490732605522584,1.489078543260112,-0.0221704558523925,0.0827019023180831,-0.8177948049536004,0.0962328594763442,0.0018214936247723,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0027505946276749,-0.9992,0.088,0.263,0.649,Negative,Very Strong

the protest on wednesday outside the national assembly building in cape town saw a direct confrontation between the police and about  students 
the protesting students were mainly angry at the increased tuition fees in the universities they also voiced anger at south africas grim economic prospects

we will do everything that is possible to regain normality on our campuses we want the violence to stop gordhan said adding many students face financial hardships that undermine their ability to succeed academically 
gordhan said south africas  growth forecast stood at  percent he also stated that an extra  billion rand  billion would be earmarked for funding university students 
he warned that a growing sense of political uncertainty in south africa could seriously harm the countrys financial position in the world 
much more disturbing and more difficult is the rise in our own communities of anger and discontent spilling over into violence and destructive protests gordhan said adding it is not just that our economic outlook is distressed and there is the possibility of downgrades in credit ratings

as the trooper approaches the drivers side dashcam video shows he immediately recognized the brinkley chief of police and laughingly asks where are you going so fast 
randle  obviously familiar to the state trooper  isnt asked to produce identification and tells the officer hes headed for the game which he later clarified for thv was the clarendonmarvell football game 
at that point the brinkley officer who had summoned state police for assistance with the stop also approaches randle  as the trooper tells the chief the officer had been tailing him for miles when he finally called for assistance 
i know you didnt call the state police randle quips to the brinkley officer 
i didnt have your plate the officer replies so it didnt go over 
as thv posits that statement could indicate that since the officer did not announce the trucks license plate number into his radio nobody else would know the chief had been pulled over 
the trio laughs about the chiefs excessive speed and the officer tells him i had you locked in at  
it wont do  itll only do  randle responds referring to a governor capping his trucks speed as he later explained to thv in an unrecorded interview 
after a few more laughs the officer tells randle he measured the trucks speed over  miles an hour  and the chief was still pulling away at the time 
despite the obvious dangers of such high speeds on the narrow curvy road both the trooper and brinkley officer simply walk away from the truck as the officer says dismissively see you later chief 
video captures the last exchange between the two cops as randle pulls away  the state trooper notes he clocked the chief doing  at the curve 
in two phone interviews with thv  which were not recorded by request  randle disputes he ever came close to the trucks alleged top possible speed of  as well as the troopers claim in dashcam footage he had been rounding the curve at  mph 
additionally though the state trooper claimed that the officer had been pursuing randle for miles randle told thv that the officer was on his way to clarendon to get fingerprints from someone at the county jail 
thv spoke with local business owner benjamin martin who first noticed the stop by a brinkley officer inside clarendon city limits 
i find it you know very disheartening that anyone public official or not would show such blatant disregard for the speed limit and put the lives of innocent others at risk martin told the station in a video interview 
i just feel that no ones above the law and you know if it was me i wouldve gotten a ticket 
indeed the public might be lucky the offduty brinkley police chief didnt lose control of his vehicle while traveling at such a high rate of speed  simply to make it to a football game 
neither the brinkley officer nor the state trooper are being investigated for wrongdoing  despite giving the chief a free pass arkansas state police told thv the incident fell under control of the brinkley police department as soon as the officer arrived on scene even though the trooper affected the stop 
as a chief of police and as a law enforcement officer youre sworn to protect and serve martin asserted which is the opposite of putting the lives of others at risk 
although nothing serious resulted from randles excessive speeds it was notorious blue privilege that allowed him to drive away without even a warning 
these seemingly small favors afforded to police by police on a constant basis highlight the divide civilians feel in their encounters with law enforcement indeed the idea police belong to an exclusive club of impunity  simply because of their chosen occupation  only increases tension and resentment in their communities 
if police dont uphold and enforce the laws they enforce against civilians the law becomes an arbitrary exploitive method for generating revenue  and nothing more share social trending",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,88.90571715706947,26,6,4851,829,4.787696019300362,829.0,-1.0994543754342805,-0.7657300402589515,0.4953317297254254,0.5216525235359468,-0.2974779706456247,0.5454459740299165,0.0060313630880579,0.0,0.0048250904704463,0,1,0.0,0.0115319866121299,0.0636,0.059,0.062,0.88,Positive,Weak
No Author,news shattering the glass ceiling it is finally acceptable for women to cry at work,"email 
one year ago i was arrested for both statutory rape and possessing child pornography and i deeply regret my disgusting crimes since that fateful day ive been serving a year jail sentence using every second of that time to reflect on and repent for what i have done ive truly learned a lot about myself as a person and if our presidentelect donald trump were to recognize my transformation and to pardon me i would be honored to serve as his secretary of agriculture 
in the event donald j trump pardons and then appoints me to his future cabinet i jared fogle current federal inmate and former subway spokesperson could think of no greater privilege than to serve our commander in chief and our country as the head of our department of agriculture 
it is the secretary of agricultures sworn duty to provide assistance to our nations farmers as well as to protect farmland and enforce food safety and if i am let out of jail i believe i am ready for the task to have donald trump both forgive my childsex crimes and recognize how useful my deep knowledge of lettuce tomatoes onions peppers hot italian peppers olives and other sub toppings could be to his administration would make my heart swell with pride 
to serve our farmers at the federal level would be greater than any subway sandwich i ever ate greater than any subway commercial i ever made and greater than any large pair of pants i ever wore 
as someone who has sold hundreds of millions of subway sandwiches to the american people since the year  i know the burden of working for the public and i would not let our new president nor the american people down it would be an immense privilege to serve for a full four years and pending donald trump negating my seven federal counts of production of child pornography i would start that process immediately 
i lost over  pounds and ate thousands of subway sandwiches before i was arrested for paying for sex with a minor and i do hope that presidentelect trump considers that fact when making his decision whether or not to pardon and appoint me secretary of agriculture to serve our farmers at the federal level would be greater than any subway sandwich i ever ate greater than any subway commercial i ever made and greater than any large pair of pants i ever wore 
so hopefully the next time i address you it will be not from my prison cell in englewood federal correctional institution but from the national mall in washington dc believe me the next four years would be incredible not just for me but for you should our presidentelect look deep into his heart and give the department the spokesperson it deserves",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,83,15,2631,470,4.580851063829787,470.0,0.6433228671214318,0.9253763973803462,-0.0920173766052268,-0.0411448800969569,-0.5016136562754601,-0.0305094121298421,0.0042553191489361,0.0,0.002127659574468,0,0,0.0,0.0069805085595908,0.942,0.094,0.035,0.871,Positive,Very Strong

decadeold audio exposes thensenator hillary clinton saying the us should have manipulated palestinian parliamentary elections in  to prevent a hamas victory the presidential candidate lamented that the us didnt determine who was going to win 
i do not think we should have pushed for an election in the palestinian territories i think that was a big mistake thennew york senator clinton told the jewish press a new yorkbased weekly newspaper several months after the january election 
and if we were going to push for an election then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win she said 
until friday the comment clinton made on september   only existed on a private audio cassette belonging to journalist eli chomsky an editor and a staff writer for the jewish press he interviewed clinton at the newspapers office in brooklyn 
chomsky who shared and played the tape for the observer says it is the only existing copy of that meeting with clinton during which the palestinian parliamentary election was among primary topics the comments have been posted on soundcloud 
speaking to the news portal he recalled being confused by the fact that anyone could support the idea  offered by a national political leader no less  that the us should be in the business of fixing foreign elections  audio emerges of clinton proposing election rigging in palestine censored by israeli press for past  years httpstcolsmycuzjr 
 wikileaks wikileaks october   
the interview took place nine months after the hamas movement claimed  of the  parliamentary seats pushing aside the usfavored fatah movement and securing the right to form a new cabinet that victory was neither welcomed in israel nor in the us in washington where hamas is considered a terrorist organization officials repeatedly stated that they would not work with a palestinian authority that included hamas 
thenpresident george w bush spoke of the elections as symbolizing the power of democracy but refused to deal with hamas as long as it opposed israels existence and espoused violence 
that day in september  clinton made odd and controversial comments all now saved on the minute record that chomsky held onto all these years 
i went to my bosses at the time chomsky told the observer the jewish press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody  even a direct quote from anyone  in a position of influence because they might need them down the road my bosses didnt think it was newsworthy at the time i was convinced that it was and i held onto it all these years dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter please help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks share this",dcclothesline.com,Fake,english,15.763775383339585,2.2264292892673696,109,20,2807,467,4.95289079229122,467.0,1.4382738900415812,1.8648799738466224,-0.0454527627700039,-0.0458479224671483,-0.1344469304627225,-0.0353224097857732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.8641,0.089,0.069,0.842,Positive,Very Strong
Joseph Puder,unescos antiisrael bias,"hillary clinton hits unfavorability high of  higher than trump october    
remember last week when hillary clinton was shopping around for white house drapes and the popular wisdom was that she was inevitable that was fun wasnt it now she hit an unfavorability rating high of  percent thats higher than trump 
it also means that the candidate who claims shes going to bring americans together is disliked by most of the country  
clinton is seen unfavorably by  percent of likely voters in the latest results a new high trump is seen unfavorably by essentially as many   percent marking the depth of these views  percent see clinton strongly unfavorably and  percent say the same about trump  unusual levels of strong sentiment 
the extent of partisan antipathy in this poll produced for abc by langer research associates is remarkable ninetyseven percent of trump supporters see clinton unfavorably  percent strongly so ninetyfive percent of clinton supporters see trump unfavorably  again  percent strongly so 
but remember hillary is inevitable 
now the clinton campaign has decided to go after the fbi under the assumption that people like hillary more than the fbi that may be a slight misjudgment and by slight i mean huge because not only is the fbi more popular than hillary so are major landfills ufo cattle mutilations and a number of international war criminals",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,82.22642928926737,23,3,1372,222,5.09009009009009,222.0,-1.1911794934635285,-1.3294321861387173,-0.4251131085287814,-0.4299297160327791,0.0009553212401887,-0.4283838850201489,0.0045045045045045,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0068021461738448,0.8847,0.125,0.05,0.824,Positive,Very Strong
Branko Mali,hell comes to frogtown alt right and triumph of transhumanism,"st century wire says 
if there was any doubt as to the intellectual bankruptcy and democratic decline of the eus super bureaucratic class those doubts can finally be put to rest this week it seems that europes technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of euro red scare brainwashing 
the new eu resolution compares russian media organizations to terrorist groups like isis see full report below the report also claims that russian  social media and internet trolls  are somehow  challenging democratic values  the new antirussia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the antirussia programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this grave threat to democracy a touch oxymoronic isnt it 
eu parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot claiming that europe is currently at war with russia is one thing but the hysterical notion that russian propaganda is somehow damaging the minds of europeans is a whole new level of crazy 
no wonder millions of britons voted to leave the eu this past summer 
the cold reality is that most of the dangerous views and information aired on rt are by presenters contributors and pundits  westerners  not russians the reason rts audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see rts reports as more accurate and truthful than media monoliths like the bbc cnn and other establishment outlets by spending most of their time effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences the age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over rt understood this in  when their news network took shape  years later western media moguls are playing catchup albeit in vainsunset for goebbels hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a deep state star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge  obsessed with controlling real information rather than disseminating it  that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good they are simply unable to do authentic journalism or speak truth to power  incredibly instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime ideologues in brussels want to attack rt 
the faceless force behind this latest xenophobic eu resolution are those in washington paris and london who are still hellbent on keeping antirussian economic sanctions in place  much to the disservice of many european businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with russia when donald trump is sworn in this january the usukeu antirussian axis could disintegrate within a year  so this latest move by brussels could be a lastditch effort to do some damage as europes neomccarthyites plot their escape out the back door from their disastrous coup detat in the ukraine  to natos hubris in the baltic and beyond and the eus migrant crisis debacle and the tens of millions of euros being laundered by eu member states through a pseudo ngo called the  white helmets in syria  these last  years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history  an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy underpinned by a backward and confused ideology 
we tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre brussels adventure see the following video and written report by rt international 
 rt meps in strasbourg have voted on a nonlegislative resolution which calls for the eu to respond to information warfare by russia rt and sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous tools of hostile propaganda 
the eu parliaments resolution demonstrates  political degradation  in regard to the  idea of democracy  in the west russian president vladimir putin said on wednesday commenting on the vote 
putin pointed out that while  everyone tries to lecture  russia on democracy european lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions  which is not the best way  to deal with any issues 
 the best approach is an open discussion in which bright and solid arguments to support ones point of view should be presented  putin said 
adding that he hopes the western move to  counter russian propaganda  wont lead to serious restrictions the president congratulated rt and sputnik journalists on their work 
in the wednesday vote  meps supported the resolution based on the report  eu strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties  with  voting against it and  abstaining 
written by a polish member of the european conservatives and reformists ecr group anna fotyga the report alleged that moscow aims to  distort the truth provoke doubt divide the eu and its north american partners paralyze the decisionmaking process discredit the eu institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among eu citizens  
the report suggests that moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in eu member states causing disintegration within the bloc 
at the same time russia is accused of  information warfare  with such entities as rt tv channel sputnik news agency rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the russkiy mir russian world fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda tools  
the document places russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as islamic state is formerly isisisil 
the report also mentions some  social media and internet trolls  from russia who are thought to  challenge democratic values  
it called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived russian propaganda threat by means of  investing in awareness raising education online and local media  it also suggests stronger cooperation between the eu and nato  on strategic communication  
sputnik has already appealed to the un the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and a number of international journalists organizations and ngos including reporters without borders to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the eu 
 the resolution hits straight at a number of respected media including sputnik agency and has an aim to stop their activity in the eu moreover the resolution bluntly contradicts the eus own human rights and freedom of press norms reads the letter signed by sputnik editorinchief margarita simonyan 
during the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote meps campaigning for the resolution said the eu was  at war with russia on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter  and that with an alleged  aim to split europe the kremlin forces its information into our countries",21stcenturywire.com,Fake,english,13.949260103271609,2.2264292892673696,61,10,6974,1112,5.205035971223022,1112.0,-0.0293279984263869,-0.0141271790859303,1.0570173841128014,0.965306187124002,0.114395633100898,0.9994720862394196,0.0026978417266187,0.0,0.0,0,3,0.0,0.0066824638807529,-0.9984,0.086,0.154,0.76,Negative,Very Strong

No Author,sanders calls trump political coward over voter suppression report,"zero hedge october   
in the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the clinton campaign and the doj among the recent batch of hacked emails released by wikileaks we learn that the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta hillarys campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik  who is currently a top official at the us justice department serving as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs 
peter kadzik with lobbyist tony podesta brother of john podesta  
the postbenghazi dinner was attended by podesta kadzik superlobbyist vincent roberti and other wellplaced beltway fixtures the first mention of personal contact between podesta and kadzik in the wikileaks dump is in an oct   email sent out by vincent roberti a lobbyist who is close to podesta and his superlobbyist brother tony podesta in it roberti refers to a dinner reservation at posto a washington dc restaurant the dinner was set for  that evening just one day after clinton gave  hours of testimony to the benghazi committee  
podesta and kadzik met several months later for dinner at podestas home another email shows  another email sent on may    kadziks son asked podesta for a job on the clinton campaign 
as the daily caller notes  the dinner arrangement is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices as one former us attorney tells told the dc the exchanges are another example of the clinton campaigns cozy relationship with the obama justice department 
the hacked emails confirm that podesta and kadzik were in frequent contact in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server says matthew whitaker the executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust a government watchdog group 
 its the kind of thing the american people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of hillary clinton  he added comparing the podestakadzik meetings to the revelation that attorney general loretta lynch met in private with bill clinton at the airport in phoenix days before the fbi and doj investigating hillary clinton 
kadziks role at the doj where he started in  is particularly notable kadzik as helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president 
a long friendly history 
podesta and kadzik have a long history one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing clinton email scandal as dc helps summarize kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office 
that history is cited by podesta in another email hacked from his gmail account in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who  kept me out of jail 
as the dc chuck ross notes it is unclear to which case podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison but podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the lewinsky affair and the rich pardon scandal as deputy chief of staff to clinton in  podesta asked thenunited nations ambassador bill richardson to hire the yearold lewinsky  in april  the white house transferred lewinsky from her job as a white house intern to the pentagon in order to keep her and bill clinton separate but the clinton team also wanted to keep lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with clinton 
richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered lewinsky the position but that she declined it 
podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by independent counsel kenneth starr for the investigation but he defended the falsehoods saying later that he was merely relaying false information from clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time he did lie to me podesta said about clinton in a national public radio interview in  clinton was acquitted by the senate in feb  of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the lewinsky probe kadzik then a lawyer with the firm dickstein shapiro morin  oshinsky represented podesta through the fiasco 
podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal 
kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta 
the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon 
on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library 
kadziks current role 
in his current role as head of the office of legislative affairs kadzik handles inquiries from congress on a variety of issues in that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the clinton investigation the justice department and fbi have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation which concluded in july with no charges filed against clinton 
but kadzik worked on other clinton email issues in his dealings with congress last november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation  
in a feb   letter in response to kadzik florida rep ron desantis noted that kadzik had explained that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the attorney general when an investigation or prosecution by the department of justice would create a potential conflict of interest 
desantis a republican suggested that lynchs appointment by bill clinton in  as us attorney in new york may be considered a conflict of interest he also asserted that obamas political appointees  a list which includes kadzik  are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as department of justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the democratic nomination for president of the united states

kadziks first involvement in the clinton email brouhaha came in a sept   response letter to senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the doj was investigating clinton last month politico reported that kadzik angered republican lawmakers when in a classified briefing he declined to say whether clinton aides who received doj immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes

every ethnic group except whites blocvotes for the democrats coincidentally the democrats have brought in another  to  million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades 
it doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate in  workingclass whites sat out the election rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in mitt romney this year the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for hillary because trump is tacky and gross 
the sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top  percent the rest of us will be their servants 
the people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class the middle class who will soon be working class and most of all women minorities children the elderly the weakest and most vulnerable members of society 
look to mexico for your future  or any third world country or to univisions jorge ramos the ruling class in mexico is composed of europeanlooking white descendants of spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their spanish names in return british settlers in america brought women with them 
explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family 
one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing 
when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces  this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing 
as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants 
thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling 
and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation 
immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled 
in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling 
somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing 
in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack 
when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants 
even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two 
compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack 
 two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july   
 two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online july   
needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegalalien gang rape at all 
the ultimate primer on the bluecollar billionaire order ann coulters book in trump we trust e pluribus awesome 
by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place 
the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex 
those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican 
that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team 
similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one 
when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men 
conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam 
sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape 
 why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam 
 reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment 
perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good 
manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher 
our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe

Ann Tenna,comment on ag lynch told fbi director comey not to go public with the new clinton email investigation by ann tenna,"posted by david risselada 
much to the surprise of the american electorate both on the right and left the fbi is reopening its investigation into hillary clintons email scandal  whether this will amount to anything meaningful or it is simply a distraction is any bodys guess many are speculating that this could be the issue which would cause president obama to cancel the elections  in my recent article corrupting ones self is the ultimate morality in the pursuit of utopia i discussed the possibility that the blatant corruption is deliberately being thrust in our face to create the necessary attitude for social change this idea of course is based on the writings of alinsky and other social engineers skilled in the arts of propaganda and psychological manipulation looking at it from this perspective cancelled elections are a possibility the truth is with hillary clinton you never know what to expect because she is operating from an ends justify the means mentality and she is willing to do anything to see her dreams of a collectivized america move forward 
according to elizabeth harrington from the washington free beacon the clinton campaign began conducting focus groups to determine which approach hillary should take concerning her run for the presidency hillary is diehard ideologue whose beliefs are right in line with communists dictators like stalin and mao she believes that ordinary people have no idea how to best conduct their personal business and the state should be involved in every aspect of our lives the goal of these focus groups was to determine the attitudes of the electorate in order to mold her message and her personality into something they would vote for many people would attempt to ridicule and discredit anyone associating hillary clinton with communists because she comes across as compassionate and caring always blaming everything on a vast right wing conspiracy 
this has always been the modus operandi of the communist movement and it explains why so many young people have no idea about the atrocities committed under the regimes of communist rulers todays millennials are well aware of the holocaust and the millions of jews murdered by adolph hitler they may not however know that hitler murdered more than jews he started by eliminating the sick and disabled then he murdered christians homosexuals and anyone else essentially that didnt go along with his national socialism the belief is that fascism is an extreme right wing world view this explains the hostility towards todays conservative movement they have been branded as fascists when in fact the truth is the exact opposite on the true political scale national socialism or fascism is to the right of communism which represents complete state control but it is still way left of center a true extreme right wing world view would be complete absence of government control over anything with this being said and understanding that the horrors of communism have all been forgotten simply because they are no longer being taught the communists have been very successful in deceiving people because like hillary clinton they pretend to be something they are not 
millions of young people in america due to left wing indoctrination in our universities  are falling for the communist propaganda under the guise that communism is a more fair compassionate system of economics left wing professors refusing to acknowledge the failures of communism because they believe the right leader has not come along to implement it the right way have failed to teach these young minds that the pursuit of total equality has led to the death of  people under communist controlled governments communists believing not in god but in evolution and science believe that man can be trained into submission and a refusal to accept communist ideals is in fact a sign of mental deficiency therefore it is justifiable to eliminate them to understand this read brainwashing a synthesis of the russian textbook on psychopolitics communists also hide this belief by claiming their pursuit of equality is motivated by a pursuit of social and economic justice when in fact it is motivated by a pure desire to control every aspect of human being 
the black book of communism references the historical debate over the evil natures of both communism and nazism adolf hitler despite his cruelty was open about what his intentions were he set out to create a perfect race that understood its role was to serve the state and nothing else this isnt any different than the goals of communism truthfully only insofar as communists seek to accomplish this on a global scale using the economic class issue as opposed to race while national socialism focuses on achieving such a goal for the country itself the communists on the other hand as mentioned above pretended to be compassionate about the poor and oppressed when in reality they use these groups to organize for power while hiding behind the guise of compassion and the struggle to achieve social justice while in realitythey are systematically imprisoning and murdering all that dont go along with their agenda this according to the black book of communism makes the communist ideology if you could really assign degrees of evil more evil than nazism because of its deceptive nature 
we all know hillary clinton is a liar and she wrote her college thesis on saul alinsky but do we know anything else about her given the fact that she conducted focus groups to help mold her campaign message it is obvious she is hiding something over the past several weeks we have seen references to leaked emails which show she has an obvious disdain for the average american and the common beliefs in liberty that most of us share she has referred to many of us as irredeemable deplorables in an effort to brand us as the uncompassionate ones while pretending to care about the poor and so called oppressed in fact this is the whole strategy of the democrat party because as we all know they have taken a hard turn left and do not represent the views of most americans they will however pretend to in order to get in office what are her intentions if she were to assume office are the massive dehumanization campaigns where conservatives are labeled as fascists and whites as automatic racists a first step to a repeat of history where millions were slaughtered because they were deemed as undesirable by their own government looking at the deceptive nature of hillary clinton and the violent nature of the left it sure seems like a distinct possibility 
the number of deaths under communist regimes from the black book of communism soviet union vladimr lenin and joseph stalin million deaths chinamao  million deaths vietnam ho chi mihn  million deaths north korea  million deaths cambodia pol pot  million deaths eastern europe  million deaths latin america  deaths africa  million deaths afghanistan under soviet control  million deaths 
these are not deaths represented by wartime or revolutions but by outright murder committed by evil men intent on creating perfect societies based on social justice and equality i guess the question remains is man capable of bringing about a perfect society

No Author,michelle obama poses in a pretty dress so racist conservatives call her a monkey screenshots,"on november    pm  
post election the media and donald trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history they are making the claim that trump wasnt elected because of racism he was elected because of the economy the problem with that argument though is that its simply not true trump voters are racist and theres proof 
the american national elections study anes began the study in january initially they asked how likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead now of course anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that its very unlikely that whites arent getting jobs because minorities are but thats not what trump voters think the vast majority said that its extremely likely that minorities are taking jobs from white people graph courtesy of anes and salon  
then they asked the same trump voters about a nonracial issue trade despite the fact that trade was one of trumps signature issues their opinions on trade were mixed 
post election this is what the study found 
the question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for trump over clinton eightyfour percent of whites who believe it is extremely likely that whites cant find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support trump compared with  percent of those who think it is not at all likely among white democrats  percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support trump over clinton compared with less than  percent of those who believe it is not at all likely eightyone percent of white women who think it is extremely likely people of color are taking jobs supported trump compared with  percent who dont think that 
more than that  percent of white trump supporters say black people are violent  percent think that of muslims 
unfortunately democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism hoping that eventually the aging bigots will die off it turns out their children are just as bad sean mcelwee the man who was responsible for publishing the study suggested this 
democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic racial and gender justice together a multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic racial and gender inequality as ive shown with political scientist jason mcdaniel racism often diminishes support for progressive policies the solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising american electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation 
great idea if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots claims go unchallenged

Jason Easley,retired  star general blasts trump for not supporting us troops,"by rmuse on sun oct th  at  pm the fbi has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters the faintest appearance of using the agency to influence our election is deeply troubling share on twitter print this post the following is an opinion column by r muse 
as a nation of laws the american people should and most likely do demand that law enforcement officials hew as closely to the law as humanly possible and that goes double for the countrys largest investigative agency one thing every american who has ever watched a law enforcement press conference after a crime has occurred understands is that the public never really knows the details of an investigation regardless the severity of the crime or who the suspect is as an occasional print journalist this author can attest that asking a police spokesman for details during a press conference about what the police are doing or who they are investigating never fails to get a stern scolding about expecting law enforcement to reveal any facts during an investigation for glaringly obvious reasons the scold always includes referral to the agency responsible for charging and prosecuting a crime after the investigation is complete and the results are handed over to the local district attorney 
apparently the federal bureau of investigation fbi director james comey never got the memo that discussing an investigation publicly is verboten if for no other reason than to maintain the integrity of said investigation and not hamper a possible prosecution however as it turns out mr comey did get a memo  from the department of justice in the form of a warning  but because he is a law unto himself and his allegiance is to house republicans and not the department of justice he ignored the doj counsel to do a solid for the gop less than two weeks before a presidential election 
since mr comey cant keep it investigations in his pants or follow longstanding law enforcement and investigative rules or take heed to justice department warnings it is incumbent on president barack obama to summarily fire fbi director james comey on the morning of wednesday november th  why should president obama wait until the day after a general election to fire the partisan director of the fbi so as not to give the appearance of any impropriety or partisanship during a campaign or just prior a presidential election something fbi director james comey is apparently incapable of comprehending 
this incident just like the one in july when comey broke precedent and convened a press conference in july and then publicly testified before congress to discuss the bureaus ongoing investigation is more than just a breach of precedent it smacks of partisanship for more than one reason first as mentioned above not only did the department of justice warn mr comey that it was inappropriate to discuss an ongoing investigation at all much less so close to an election that warning came after the fbi contacted the doj about going public with information the bureau admitted it had not yet even  reviewed  that was precisely what comey told his republican buddies in a letter to congress 
in the letter  comey told congressional republicans that the fbi really had no clue whether any of the emails were related to hillary clintons private email server but what he did  know  for sure was that they  appeared  to be pertinent even though his agency the fbi had not yet examined them so the real pertinent question is why did mr comey publicly inform congress about emails the agency had not yet examined if he wasnt attempting to inject some  partisan drama  into the election that might have deleterious impact on the outcome 
it is just as pertinent a question as demanding to know from mr comey precisely what his motivation was in holding a press conference back in july to discuss the agencys finding on an investigation before the doj weighed in or discuss that investigation in public and before a viciously partisan republican committee in congress and no it was not to defend the bureaus decision not to bring criminal charges against clinton only a braindead moronic imbecile or partisan republican hack would begin to think that the fbi cia local sheriff or any police investigative agency has the ability to bring charges to prosecute a violation for dogs sake even the s fictional sheriff andy griffiths hapless deputy barney fife was competent enough to comprehend that a district attorneys office or department of justice is tasked with prosecution any violation of the law 
according to mr comey who was  stung by criticism from both democrats and republicans  as well as former prosecutors and  appeared to be on the defensive   he felt obligated to inform republicans in congress  even though the bureau really didnt  know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails  likely because he knew they did not come from hillary clinton as an aside sarah jones has a nifty summary of the email caper the fbi uncovered while investigating  serial sexter  anthony weiners laptop computer ipad and cellphone and no anthony weiner was not sexting nasty pictures to presidential candidate hillary clinton 
it doesnt matter what kind of pathetic excuse comey gave for publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation it is virtually impossible to believe he didnt have partisan intents and purposes in publicly alerting house republicans as interim chairwoman of the democratic national committee donna brazile said  the fbi has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters  even the faintest appearance of using the agencys power to influence our election is deeply troubling  ms brazile demanded more information from comey and didnt conceal her concern over comey interfering with the election 
mr comey claimed very conveniently one might add that as a diedinthewool republican he contributed to john mccain and willard romneys presidential campaigns in  and  respectively that he is not a republican now that was his remark back in july when he first began breaking precedent and revealing information about an investigation that was the proper purview of the department of justice not the federal bureau of investigation it was a suspicious  confession  in july and it is nearly impossible to believe in late october after he ignored department of justice warnings and revealed information about an ongoing investigation into a disgraced former congressman and serial sexter just  days before an election and before the bureau had even reviewed anything 
comey cannot possibly remain as head of the federal bureau of investigation after twice revealing information about an ongoing investigation if comey hadnt taken heat for his reveal in july and a warning from the justice department this week then one might just regard him as an inept law enforcement official pulling a publicity stunt for attention but since he was warned and is not an inept law enforcement official it is more than reasonable to believe that comeys most recent act was a partisan political ploy that should earn him a summary termination on november   because firing his partisan personage just prior to the general election would break a longstanding precedent and look like a highly partisan move something a sap like james comey might try but not president obama",politicususa.com,Real,english,100.0,92.2978201200483,63,10,7333,1210,5.024793388429752,1210.0,0.0318220802597783,-0.0141271790859303,1.1519986134698754,1.1189389045502545,-0.0634861196084669,1.15669667633317,0.0033057851239669,0.0,0.0033057851239669,0,0,0.0,0.0058537605699641,-0.986,0.071,0.098,0.831,Negative,Very Strong

the latest batch of the podesta emails shared by wikileaks add a darker dimension if it was even possible to the sordid culture of corruption lies and depravity that surrounds hillary clinton explaining why the fbi has been calling her for quite some time now the antichrist personified  
it is a possibility that hellarys clique attends and organizes satanic rituals involving mockup scenes of cannibalism and sexual abuse involving children 
one of the emails directed at tony podesta john podestas brother contains the following sentence 

i am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place 
do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining 
this really does not sounds like much until you discover the author of this invitation she who walks in the footsteps of the beast 
this is the woman who sent the email marina abramovic dressed in red and holding the skinned head of a dead goat a clear reference to the occult character baphomet 
there is proof that the clinton foundation directly transferred abramovic ten thousand dollars in at least one instance for her services abramovic carving a pentagram in the flesh of her stomach with a blade to show her artistic side 
a selfproclaimed artist abramovic hails from serbia and regularly organizes performances and events using what she calls spirit cooking 
this spirit cooking includes mixing semen breast milk urine or fresh blood before consuming it or splattering it over various things such as lifesized representations of young children like shown below 
this performance included spelling with the body fluids the following stanza 
with a sharp 
knife cut deeply into the 
middle finger of your 
left hand 
eat the pain 
other examples of her art nowadays any revolting expression of bad taste if sporting the correct pair of problem glasses include public dinners where politicians hollywood stars singers and decision makers gather to eat cakes that depict a naked human corpse or feast on the fake i hope by all that is sacred blood contained in a coffin where swims another human body celebrities that use demonic symbols in their persona such as lady gaga rush to participate to abramovics events another heavy user of the occult symbols jayz is a big fan of marina 
these codes are all directly copied from rituals such as black masses or sabat night reunions and popularized by figures such as aleister crowley from whom abramovic draws direct inspiration 
it is part of this growing phenomenon where the elites and celebrities close to power get caught intentionally or not showing symbols celebrating the ancient babylonian rites or the worship of the devil on november the th clinton chose jayz in a last bid to draw crowds to her empty rallies coincidence innocent children involved in that mess 
there is hard evidence that bill clinton traveled at least  times sometimes without his bodyguards it is all in the pilot logs to billionaire and convicted pedophile jeffrey epsteins island on board his plane dubbed the lolita express as it is in this plane that the guests could allegedly have sex with minors 
with this in mind it is disturbing to notice that other podesta emails refer to children as being the entertainment at pool parties almost entirely attended by middleaged men involved in politics other emails involve strange references to food such as pizza cheese  worth of hot dogs for a party that attendees dream of and recipes that many sources suggest are code words for orgies involving minors and extremely young children you can read more about it here  the whole clinton bag of crooks reeks of unnatural sexual behaviour and reproachable acts and we will certainly know much more in the days to come as hillary clinton is still under fbi investigation as we speak this follows the scandal surrounding huma abedin clintons right hand and confidant and her estranged husband sex offender and champion onehanded texter anthony weiner it will take some time before they go through weiners  emails and decide of a course of action regarding these dark revelations and other atrocities of the clinton crime family la plus belle ruse du diable est de vous persuader quil nexiste pas drawing by ben garrison 
these heavy accusations of satanism remind us of the sexual blackmail practices said to take place among the popular hiphop and hollywood communities as roosh described in his related article  or other rumours linked to suspicious reunions involving the secret ceremonies of the elite such as the ones of the bohemian grove or the rothschilds parties of the s 
if those recent speculations turn out to be true it could have the effect of a bomb and mean a revolution 
observe the symbols of cannibalism eerily similar in the three following pictures those are respectively a scene of the rothschilds surrealistic bal a painting hanging in john podestas office and one of abramovics dinners

Astronomy,there may be another planet in our solar system,"levers of power flushing the vote down the memory hole electronic election fraud exposed david knight  infowarscom  october   comments 
establishment politicians and press are outraged that trump would question the integrity of their system 
they say it undermines public trust in political institutions 
yet to see who is truly undermining public trust we need look no further than the people running the elections who are shutting down election audit procedures who stonewall and eject certified election monitors and who make any recording of malfunctioning voting machines a felony 
one such person is texas director of elections keith ingram 
this story is specific to texas but the same tactics are used nationwide by both parties to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in electronic voting 
i went to the texas secretary of state offices to ask mr ingram about specific procedural changes he has made in his  year tenure and the changes he attempted to make in august that would have gone into effect this november 
with camera  mic in hand we told the reception desk that we were with the press and would like to talk to the director about the election 
we were told to wait in the lobby and mr ingram would be down 
you can see for yourself what happened when he saw the mic flag showing we were with infowars 
the man running the election bureaucracy runs from questions 
so much for transparency and candor 
this unelected bureaucrat is tasked with ensuring that counties adhere to election law 
what follows are the specific actions taken by his office that waive requirements and undermine election integrity in texas 
but before we get to specifics about his actions  his connection to the rose law firm in arkansas there are some general questions that should concern voters nationwide 
 why would standards required by our elected lawmakers for election integrity be bent to the capabilities of vendors rather than require vendors to perform to the standard 
 why would election procedures be waived and honesty and transparency sacrificed for the convenience of election workers  officials 
burning the paper trail 
in august  ingram texas director of elections attempted to make last minute rule changes for the upcoming november  election that would eliminate crucial paper backup records for electronic voting his office issued new rules that would 
eliminate printing of paper audit logs that poll watchers are entitled to monitor at main tabulation computers 
eliminate printing of early voting results tapes 
eliminate printing of ballot images for recounts 
fortunately activists and some elected representatives got the proposed rule changes postponed with a formal public hearing scheduled after the november election 
state senator don huffines said the states chief election officers must reconsider and redraft their proposed election rules to pursue more realtime paper records and backups not fewerthe comfort  convenience of election administrators should not take priority over voters confidence and election integrity 
but even though these procedures have been postponed ingrams previous rule changes are still a cause for concern in the november election and have caused repercussions in two election cases currently being litigated here are some of the problems 
 waiver of laws requiring a partial manual recount audit 
ingram waived the requirement to conduct a manual count in  of the election precincts or  election precincts whichever is greater this was waived in all  counties the day after the march  primary the timing is significant because during the primary there were  move votes than voters in hill county in the republican primary the margin of victory was  in texas house district  that contains hill county in calling for a criminal investigation ingram noted that it appears  or  voters voted more than once in the election and one voter voted as many as four times yet he waived the partial manual recount audit requirement statewide and he has waived other audit and monitoring procedures 
 waiver of laws requiring printing of paper backup results tapes 
ingrams waivers issued in   and  appear to be in direct contradiction of state election laws      and the judges handbook these rules require   three original tally lists shall be maintained at the polling place to record the number of votes received for the candidates  on completion of the vote count the presiding judge shall prepare the returns of the election for the precinct with total number of voters total number of votes with the presiding judge signing each of the  copies to certify 
ingram also issued waivers for requirements that a zero tape be printed from the machines at the beginning of election day and a tally tape printed at the close of election his letter states that the process of printing of the zero tape and tally tape at each countywide precinct location could take hours in both the morning and the evening of election day 
so expediency for election workers takes precedent over requirements enacted by the legislature for integrity of elections and if a favored vendor cant perform to the law the law is waived 
if proper procedures had been followed to ensure that the machine was at a zero state instead of waived by ingram the hill county issue of  more voters than votes would not have happened the vendor in hill county ess eventually identified the source of the extra votes saying an audit of the log report from the central paper ballot scanner showed that the hard drive had not been properly cleared of all ballots cast before scanning early voting or election day ballotsthere are established election protocols which should be followed to prevent this type of reporting error 
but the director of elections is waiving those established election protocols ingrams waver of legal requirements  his improvised solution of printing a zero tape at the county warehouse prior to election day opens the door for error and fraud 
 ignoring laws requiring printing of legally sufficient ballot images for recounts 
the secretary of state election division claims that cast vote records are equivalent to ballot images as you can see the cast vote records are very different from ballots and are not uniquely numbered 
the texas constitution article   suffrage section  says in all elections by the people the vote shall be by ballot and the legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box 
yet the machines by vendors hart intercivic and ess certified by ingram do not provide uniquely numbered ballots per state recount laws and dont provide other components of a legal texas ballot 
 ignoring laws that allow poll watchers to monitor all election activities such as the printing of paper audit logs for computerized result tabultion 
texas election code sec  says a watcher is entitled to observe any activity conducted at the location at which the watcher is serving 
affidavits from two official poll watchers for a candidate in dallas county with official poll watcher signed forms detail how they were repeatedly obstructed from monitoring multiple election activities at the dallas county central counting station such as ballot scanning vote transfer ballot transfer computer activities ballot tabulation and viewing the elections computer line printer they state that they were repeatedly treated disrespectfully obstructed and blatantly ignored by the election officials and voting machine vendor before being thrown out after the officials spoke with the texas secretary of state elections office 
hostility to election monitors like ingrams refusal to answer our questions destroy the publics confidence in the honesty of the process  and rightfully so 
ingrams connections to arkansas kutak rock rose law firm  hillary clinton 
according to a public information request of ingrams secretary of state personnel file ingram left private practice and moved to little rock arkansas taking a job with the law firm kutak rock ll at kutak rock he worked under the managing partner gordon miller wilbourn who had been a partner with hillary clinton vince foster and webster hubbell at the rose law firm in arkansas in the s the wilbourn family is a large donor to the clinton foundation and the hillary clinton campaign 
ingram left kutak rock to return to texas when he was hired by gov rick perrys appointment office in  to oversee statewide political appointments for various courts boards  commissions 
ingramss career moves are interesting in just  months his journey from private practice in texas through arkansas clintoncronies and back to texas government resulted in pay cuts with each move and his salary being cut in half in  ingram was promoted to director of the election division in the texas secretary of states office where his salary was still  less than private practice 
ingrams determination to remove paper trails and auditing procedures for electronic voting is even more troubling when we look at his connections to big clinton donors 
establishment of both parties dont appear to want election integrity 
in one lawsuit contesting election results for austin city council the county could not produce any ballot images as required by law to conduct a recount computer logs had multiple corruptioninvalid errors during discovery it was learned that the computer counted more votes than registered voters in  of the  precincts forming the district one precinct had  voter turnout another was just  registered voters shy of  in spite of only  and  countywide turnout in the general and runoff elections 
the county democrat party has financed legal opposition to the lawsuit and a republican judge claimed there was no evidence for election irregularities 
there are some positive developments however the republican judge has now been voted off the bench of the solidly republican county and state legislators have taken up the question of election integrity that has so far been ignored by governor abbotts office 
state senator bob hall said due to an increasing number of complaints it is time for the texas elections division office to take immediate and decisive action to rescind all waivers issued by that officeand instruct all texas counties using electronic voting systems to consistently adhere to all election laws 
voters regardless of political affiliation should reject policies and personnel that compromise honest transparent elections for example chambers county in texas recently announced electronic voting would be suspended until the glitches affecting voting machines could be corrected its time to remove keith ingram as texas director of elections and replace easily hacked electronic voting machines with paper ballots",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,2.2264292892673696,47,9,10847,1726,5.221900347624565,1726.0,-0.4573785492295443,-0.2020278943791856,2.081703460157223,1.927862192223175,0.1310391187088343,1.9845322731533244,0.0005793742757821,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0014350907368476,0.5952,0.073,0.07,0.858,Positive,Strong

Kyle Trouble,things to know about prague czech republic,"what motivates you to live what is the meaning of life
for centuries mankind has questioned everything mankinds quest for the answer to what drives us and what pushes us forward in times of darkness is not exempt from analysis in fact its been a consistent theme since the dawn of time stoicism  although not directly attributed to answering what drives us skirts around the topic and creates a general set of principles to help us deal with negative externalities in life
while many philosophers have pontificated on the subject of mankinds driving force and the will to live theres a problem inherent with such an analysis in order to research such a basic and instinctual topic one needs to experience a visceral cerebral experience that brings him or her to a basic instinctual level before having such an epiphany one needs to examine our animalistic base and then explore logically from there
one such analysis is known as logotherapy from the greek word logoswise  logotherapy developed by viktor frankl is an influential school of psychotherapy that is founded on the pillars of what motivates mankind before we delve into logotherapy however its important that we discuss viktor franklwho he was and why his unique perspective provides for an incredibly powerful source of credibility and authority

viktor frankl was born in  in what was at that time known as austriahungary frankl was a neurologist and psychiatrist his early life was relatively unspectacular but from an early age he displayed an interest in philosophy as well as psychotherapy initially interested in freud and adlers work he began to see their faults and eventually diverged from their teachingsbecoming particularly interested in depression as well as suicide
during  frankl in completing his residency in neurology was responsible for setting up the selbstmörderpavillon  translated in english to the suicide pavilion its estimated that frankl along with his staff treated upwards of  women who had suicidal tendencies
in september of  his life was shaken frankl along with his wife and family were deported to a nazi concentration camp known as theresienstadt ghetto whilst there and during his stay at auschwitz frankl worked as a doctor in the psychiatric care unit focusing on mental health helping newcomers deal with shock and grief

in  after three years in a concentration camp frankl released his book entitled mans search for meaning  which details his experiences as a holocaust survivor as well as his theory which became known as logotherapy the book is divided into two partspart one is a detailed account of his experiences whereas part two discusses logotherapy
his time in the numerous concentration camps began to shape his philosophical and psychiatric theory while he had read books on the subject of psychological healing prior to his imprisonment he had never experienced it to the degree in which he had become accustomed to particularly intrigued as to why some prisoners lived longer than others frankl began to organize his thoughts and document how the average prisoners life in a concentration camp was reflected in their mind as a doctor focusing on grief and shockstricken inmates he was in a very unique position
hundreds and during some weeks thousands of helpless inmates were carted in auschwitz the mostfeared concentration camp weekly between the inmates sleeping next to him and those seeking treatment frankl noted that each prisoner without exception faced three stages of psychological reactions once entering the concentration camp these stages were shock apathy and depersonalization
while seemingly unimportant the noted documentation of these stages was very important for frankl as he began to notice while every inmate experienced these stages some experienced them to a less cerebral degree some inmates seemed less depressive than others and featured a happier disposition these inmateswith some expected variabilityoutlived the other inmates
discovery as he began to poke and prod frankl noticed something that separated these individuals from others hope there is never not meaning in life every moment no matter how painful dehumanizing or horrendous it is has meaning by extension frankl suggests even suffering is meaningful the inmates that survived the longestthe ones that outlived the rest had hope frankl suggested that he could tell whether or not an inmate would live just by looking at their facesthe face of a dejected depressed inmate was obvious and clear as day without hope they were doomed
everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of the human freedomsto choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way
the next question that frankl sought to answer was an important one and the foundational maxim of logotherapywhy did some men have hope and others not
the answer was love
the truth  that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire then i grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart the salvation of man is through love and in love i understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss be it only for a brief moment in the contemplation of his beloved
frankl in his book mans search for meaning recounted several instances where he would be driven into brief stints of depression after a beating during a latenight march in bare feet or watching his friend get treated inhumanely hed vacillate from depression by thinking and longing for his wife the men whom lasted the longest invariably had a wife or a job that they loved it was this motivator the unquantifiable love that pushed men in inhuman circumstances to existentially escape the physical realm and put mind above body
what we can get from this to answer this frankl codified three ways that he discovered is how we can find meaning in life  a job love and how we react to suffering its important to realize that while its easy to read this and assume that frankl is saying we should all suffer in order to find meaninghes not he is suggesting however that should we not have a jobdeed or love that allow us to find meaning in life we can still find meaning by choosing how to react in a negative situationour mental freedom is one of the only things that can never be taken from us theoretically speaking
the average man will never be faced with such a dire circumstance such as the atrocities that frankl and so many others dealt with what we can do however is choose how we react to lifes adversities
a fair assessment of logotherapy is that it provides a simplistic solution to a complex question life since life is such a complex series of events logotherapy offers a solution that may not be representative of lifes true hardships and intricacies in saying this my own personal evaluation is that this criticism in itself may have flaws by assuming that a complex question must have a complex solution even the assumption that life in complex can be debated its a cliched saying that life is hard or complexand even if it is its not out of the realm of possibility that a complex question has a simple solution  sometimes the answer we seek is right in front of us
viktor frankl died in september  and his works are still read today several logotherapy institutes exist today named after him

No Author,news office of the future researchers predict that over  percent of workplace discrimination will be automated by,"email several months ago we published a list of irreverent photoshops depicting the thenpresidential candidate donald trump as a bald man in several humiliating contexts we understood that these images were a bit crass and promised to remove them if trump were to win the election as a sign of respect for the office of the united states presidency true to our word we tried to take these pictures down as soon as trump was elected but unfortunately we havent been able to figure out how to delete this article from our website once content is published to our homepage it seems to be stuck there though we cannot delete the bald photoshops we have been able to stretch out donald trumps face all wide so that you cant even tell hes the one in the pictures we hope this serves as an adequate temporary solution until we find a way to take these unbecoming images down completely  at the current time we are comfortable posting this picture with the caption my bald spot is absolutely yuge alongside it but should trump assume the esteemed office of president in the fall we would immediately remove it 
we apologize that we werent able to remove this disrespectful picture of our presidentelect completely but we did what we could and stretched it out all wide you can barely tell its donald trump  regardless of whatever political views you hold it is disrespectful to show a picture of the commanderinchief along with a caption like so this is what that pile of straw on his head is for 
were talking with our programmers now to figure out a way to delete these images from the web hopefully they will develop a method for doing so in the near future in the meantime we have preserved the dignity of presidentelect trump by stretching his face out and making his eyes huge nobody will be able to recognize that the man in this image is our new president  of course it would still be fine to disagree with president trump if you dont support his policies a healthy democracy allows dissent and debate however implying that the president wears a toupee when there is no evidence that he does is a crass breach of proper decorum 
the presidency is the most hallowed office in our nation and it is worthy of reverence and decorum at all times ideally this image of donald trumps toupee flying off in the wind would no longer be on our website since this is currently impossible weve used the magic of photoshop to make his head very tall and thin his identity is obscured this bald man could be anybody  no matter who is president you address them as sir not donald the hutt we would quickly remove this if the american people choose trump on november  
this degrading photoshop of president trumps face on jabba the hutts body is immature and degrading and wed remove it if we could since we currently dont know how weve at least given him a tie to wear to imbue him with the poise and decorum the presidency confers on all who hold that hallowed office  comparing president trump to adolf hitler would remain a valid political commentary but making him bald in addition is completely uncalled for if donald trump is elected we promise to restore his normal hair to this image 
now that the american electorate has chosen donald trump to lead our nation this image depicting him as a bald adolf hitler has become an unsubtle and tactless political statement that does not meet our exacting editorial standards weve given presidentelect trump his hair back in an effort to restore his dignity  for now let us enjoy this humorous photoshop and its accompanying caption i am going to build a wig and mexico is going to pay for it during a trump presidency it would no longer have a place in the national discourse 
all right thats all of them weve stretched out presidentelect donald trumps face all wide so that nobody will know that he is the bald man in this picture hopefully well find a way to remove these pictures from our website but until then this will have to do",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,113,17,3969,713,4.549789621318373,713.0,1.5605740474139118,1.3011778279668569,0.2619795172102744,0.3398015518885461,-0.5322682538183097,0.3593433980005794,0.002805049088359,0.0,0.0014025245441795,0,0,0.0,0.0046014572552702,0.991,0.108,0.05,0.842,Positive,Very Strong

Henry Wolff,ers fans care more about victories than kaepernick,"dutch antiislam mp wilders to snub hate speech trial afp october   
defiant dutch antiislam politician geert wilders said friday he will refuse to attend his hate speech trial next week dubbing it a travesty aimed at silencing him as the country prepares for  elections 
the trial opens on monday before a threejudge bench with the farright politician facing charges of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred for comments he made about moroccans living in the netherlands 
it is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country wilders said in a statement friday dubbing the case a political trial in which i refuse to cooperate 
it comes as opinion polls have shown his farright freedom party pvv doing well ahead of march elections 
after riding high amid the migrant crisis the party is now polling neckandneck with prime minister mark ruttes liberals each predicted to win between  to  seats in the seat parliament 
set to last until november  the trial focuses on a comment made at a march  rally when wilders asked supporters if they wanted fewer or more moroccans in your city and in the netherlands 
when the crowd shouted back fewer fewer wilders answered were going to organise that 
snip 
wilders said friday he would leave his defence in the hands of his lawyer geertjan knoops and instead go to work in the parliament in the hague 
snip 
judges earlier this month dismissed arguments by wilders lawyers that the trial was politically motivated adding they did not believe it will impact the pvvs election campaign 
politicians are granted broad freedoms of expression because of their official position the judges ruled last month 
precisely therefore politicians have an important role to avoid feeding intolerance by making these kind of public statements 
wilders hit back friday saying it is a travesty that i have to stand trial because i spoke about fewer moroccans 
millions of dutch citizens  percent of the population want fewer moroccans he claimed 
not because they despise all moroccans or want all moroccans out of the country but because they are sick and tired of the nuisance and terror caused by so many moroccans

Jason Easley,hillary clinton is brilliantly forcing broke trump to spend money defending arizona,"the washington post reported donald trumps hiring of pollster tony fabrizio in may was viewed as a sign that the real estate mogul was finally bringing seasoned operatives into his insurgent operation 
but the republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran gop strategist who has advised candidates from  gop nominee bob dole to florida gov rick scott the trump campaigns latest federal election commission report shows that it is disputing nearly  that fabrizios firm says it is still owed for polling 
trumps decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given trumps history of not paying for services performed it wont be the last it is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain 
donald trumps mentality has always been to put himself first paying his debts never seems to have been a top priority for trump his businesses have been stiffing vendors and contractors for decades so it isnt surprising that he would bring this same mentality to the presidential campaign 
anybody who works for the trump campaign would be smart to get paid up front because donald trumps version of making america great involves taking your money and putting it in his own pocket

No Author,megyn kelly makes bombshell admission about trump and the media,"on november    pm  
in reaction to donald trumps victory the simpsons decided to update their  prediction of a trump presidency 
in  the show showed a glimpse into the future where president lisa simpson inherited an economic mess from president trump well now that fictional story line has become a horrifying reality 
here is the simpsons new opening with bart simpson writing on the chalkboard being right sucks the simpsons updates its  prediction of a trump presidency thesimpsons pictwittercommyfrybdj 
 the simpsons thesimpsons november   
hopefully the financial despair the fictional president trump never becomes a reality but seeing as he has no experience is a businessman whos not as good as he says he is and the simpsons have been right thus far the futures looking pretty bleak 
heres the original clip of president lisa simpson calling out a donald trump presidency for his fiscal fallout and bad economy 
early on into trumps campaign the simpsons satirized the reality tv host turned presidentelect by having homer simpson somehow at the campaign rollout and falling into trumps hair if we could only go back to that moment and enjoy the comedy over reality 
now we have to reap what weve sown or rather what the less than half of voting americans have sown considering trump only won with the electoral college and lost the popular vote to hillary clinton in his own words big league

Sarah Jones,hillary clinton laughs when asked if the new emails could sink her campaign,"in a major omen of potential election disaster for republicans donald trump has scored the lowest rating in the history of gallups presidential leadership poll 
gallup released their presidential leadership survey and the results were historically bad for donald trump 
voters rate trump worse than any other presidential candidate in gallups records on having the personality and leadership qualities a president should have previous readings were taken in late october in the   and  campaigns in those years between  and  of registered voters said the two majorparty candidates had the right personality and leadership qualities  a sharp contrast to trumps current  clintons rating of  is one percentage point below the previous low score 
clintons score while low was one point of the range for previous presidential cycles going back to  trumps score was twenty percent below the lowest score in the history of the poll 
voters arent going to elect a man to be the next president who they view as lacking the basic qualities of presidential leadership the popular vote total in  may reflect the nations political polarization but there is a reason why electoral map projections continue to look very good for the democratic candidate 
donald trump has failed the most elemental test for any presidential candidate he doesnt look act or behave like a person who has the qualities needed to occupy the oval office and lead the united states of america 
the last week before election day tension that is in the air is normal but the fundamental motivating factors of this contest havent changed democrats are holding on to their electoral map advantage while donald trump has become the central issue and question on the ballot

Henry Wolff,harvard cancels mens soccer season after finding sexually explicit reports continued through,"when the river ran red arthur kemp american renaissance september  
the year is  dodging a flurry of spears the boer commander andries pretorius rides forward to seize a zulu warrior in the midst of an epic battle between more than  warriors and just  boers pretorius has decided to take a zulu alive he wants to send the captive back to his king dingaan to convey surrender terms to the zulu nation 
the warrior has no intention of being taken alive and jabs viciously at pretorius with his assegai this is a zulu spear normally a longshafted throwing weapon but the warrior broke its shank earlier for closequarter stabbing pretorius gives up on capturing the zulu and tries to shoot him 
with a singleshot muzzleloading musket he has only one chance of a hit there is no time to reload in close combat to his horror pretorius sees the smoketrailing ball whiz past the zulus ear at the same time the zulu lunges forward causing pretoriuss horse to stumble backwards throwing the white commander to the ground 
leaping to his feet he meets the attacking zulu who knows he is now on equal terms with the white man who can no longer use his magic shooting stick and carries no weapon comparable to the assegai pretorius is now fighting for his life he just manages to sidestep the spear point striking it away with the butt of his gun 
spinning round the zulu raises his spear high above his head and thrusts down as he has been trained to do in the zulus disciplined army it is a blow that will be fatal if it strikes home but pretorius sees it coming he grabs the spear point with his left hand to ward it away from his chest the sharp point cuts deeply into his palm embedding itself at an angle that makes it impossible for the zulu to pull it out pretorius seizes the zulu by the throat with his free right hand and throws him to the ground in an attempt to strangle him 
the zulu struggles and with the help of two good hands is about to break free when one of pretoriuss men comes upon the scene he pulls the assegai out of the commanders hand and plunges it into the zulus side ending the struggle 
pretorius remounts and heads back to the boer camp for treatment he is not worried as he knows by now that this greatest of all battles between boers and zulus has already been won the main zulu army has been broken in two and the river that runs along one side of the boer camp is stained red with zulu blood the place and the tributary known previously as the ncome will be renamed blood river pretorius knows that the zulu defeat which will include some  killed on the battlefield is a fit revenge for the deception and murder committed by the zulus  months earlier 
prelude to war 
the great clash between the boer and zulu nations was not as leftist historians like to claim the result of ruthless white colonialism suppressing an indigenous people it came about because the zulus rejected an extremely reasonable attempt at negotiation by the boers 
the boers pioneers of dutch french and german descent were the people who opened up much of what was later to become south africa their first antecedents had landed on the southernmost tip of africa in  only  years after the virginia company settled on jamestown island 
when they arrived in the area now known as cape town whites came into contact only with hottentots and bushmen as the number of europeans increased they expanded east and north only meeting their first black tribe the xhosa some  miles away on south africas east coast the xhosas were migrating south fleeing the warlike zulu to the north who were engaged in imperialist expansion of their own 
for just under a century white settlement halted at this eastern frontier border formed by the coast and firm xhosa settlement it was not however a time of peace as xhosa were constantly raiding the boers who lived on the border this caused much harm and discontent among the farmers who blamed the dutchruled colonial government back in cape town for the lawlessness 
it only added to the border farmers grievances when the british took the cape colony from the dutch in  to prevent the colony from falling into french hands during the napoleonic wars it was vital to control the merchant and naval refitting station on the way to the far east the new colonial masters not only started anglicizing the colony when they abolished slavery they offered compensation that amounted to hardly a quarter of a slaves value 
exasperated by incessant xhosa attacks and british attempts to suppress their language and culture groups of frontier farmers filled with a sense of manifest destiny not seen again until the opening of the american west set forth to the north and the east in a movement known as the great trek the trekkers they became known as voortrekkers or pioneers only after  bypassed the xhosa in search of new unsettled territory in which they could establish independent boer nations all told it was only a small minority of no more than  boers who made the trek to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions they traveled in several waves of covered oxdrawn wagons much like the conestogas in which americans opened the west 
the boer leader of the time piet retief had written the trekker manifesto in which he spelled out the farmers longheld grievances against the british by the boer wagons had crossed the great mountain range into natal in an act of audacity that few thought possible the range the highest in southern africa had been named the drakensbergthe dragon mountainsbecause they were said to be impassable 
retief had identified a large piece of uninhabited land to the north of the zulu kingdom which lay open to settlement retief knew that if he wanted the land for his people he could take it unopposed however he wanted to live in peace with his zulu neighbors and before taking possession he opened negotiations with the zulu king dingaan he wanted no misunderstanding between the two peoples 
he sent a letter to the zulu king explaining why he wanted to speak to him and first visited dingaans capitala large circle of reed and grass hutson november   retief left the main body of trekkers and went to the zulu kings capital umgungundhlovo the place of the elephant to negotiate a treaty that would allow boers peacefully to settle land adjoining the zulu kingdom dingaan said he would let the boers live in natal if they recovered cattle stolen by a tlokwa chieftain retief and his men did so and dingaan agreed to give the land to the boers 
retief returned to umgungundhlovo on february   to finalize the agreement he arrived with  volunteers including his own son and three children of other menit was common for children to accompany their fathers on expeditions of this kind the next day retief and dingaan formally signed a treatythe zulu king made his mark by scratching an x on the documentgiving possession of the land to the boers delighted the boers sent scouts back to the main encampments to report the successful outcome and made ready to leave as retief and his party were about to saddle up a messenger arrived from dingaan inviting the boer party to a special celebration to mark the signing retief was suspicious but did not want to offend dingaan as they had on previous visits the boers stacked their firearms neatly outside the reed walls and entered the royal enclosure unarmed 
as they ate and drank a zulu impi or warrior unit put on a dance for the guests according to the account of a white missionary who was present the dancing warriors drew ever closer to the boers till they were just in front of the seated whites when the zulu king leaped to his feet and shouted kill the white wizards the impi fell upon the surprised boers some of them drew their hunting knives and tried to fight off the attackers but they were quickly overwhelmed 
the zulu warriors bound the whites with reed ropes and dragged them to hlomo amabutho the hill of execution near the zulu capital there they clubbed the boers to death one by one with retief kept until last and forced to watch his son being murdered after retiefs heart was extracted and presented to dingaan as proof that the boer leader was dead the bodies were left for the vultures in accordance with zulu custom 
dingaan then gave orders for the full might of his army to attack the boer camps the settlers had received the message retief had sent earlier and believed everything had gone well they were therefore completely unprepared and badly undermanned the  men in retiefs party were all dead many other men had gone hunting leaving only a light guard for the women and children the boers were so confident there would be peace that they had not even posted sentries just before dawn barking dogs aroused the outlying wagons then thousands of zulu warriors attacked the several hundred trekkers  women children and old men  as they lay sleeping 
the boer historian gustav preller who interviewed survivors left a harrowing account of the aftermath all around dozens and dozens of bodies  babies who had had their heads smashed open against the wagon wheels women dishonored and in some zulu custom their breasts cut off  in a wagon blood filled to a height of several inches the life blood of an entire family ebbed out where they lay  jan bezuidenhout one of the few young men who had not gone ahead with the retief party grabbed his fourmonthold baby daughter out of her crib and ran off through the undergrowth  having lost his pursuers a few miles away bezuidenhout checked for the first time on his daughter in his arms she was dead a single spear stroke had killed her 
the slaughter became known as the weenen the dutch word for weeping and a town of that name still stands near the site of the  boers camped in the area zulus killed some  including  children the rest survived because grazing requirements for their animals meant that the boer camps had to be widely dispersed if dingaans men had scouted more thoroughly found all the encampments and attacked them simultaneously the slaughter would have been far greater 
pretorius arrives 
the boers now faced their greatest challenge their camps were full of wounded men orphaned children and widows the zulus had stolen an estimated  head of cattle and sheep during the weenen slaughter and ammunition was running low the zulu armies might return at any time and they were a formidable force as the boers discovered when they launched a raid to avenge the massacre on april    trekkers under a divided command of piet uys and hendrik potgieter rode into zulu territory only to be defeated by some  warriors not far from umgungundhlovo in what became known as the battle of italeni 
this new disaster forced the boers to face reality they had to either abandon their quest for independence and return to the cape colony or find some means to fight their way through the widows and orphans argued strongly for pushing on they knew that if they fell back to the cape they would have to live on charity whereas if dingaan could be defeated they could at least recover their livestock many boers were also convinced that god favored them and that setbacks were only a test of faith 
it was at this moment of indecision that a popular lawyer named andries pretorius answered the trekker call for reinforcements and rode into camp with  men and a brass cannon the boers appointed him commander in chief on november  and he immediately began preparing a strike against the zulu 
his means were few a force of only about  boers including three scotsmen set out on november  seeking battle for extra protection the boer column of  wagons traveled four abreast instead of the usual single file each night they formed a circular defensive formation known as a laager 
pretorius realized that even with two frontloading cannon his force was too weak to defeat the zulu army in an open field he therefore decided to draw the enemy into an attack on the boer encampment each day patrols and scouting parties rode ahead sometimes led by pretorius himself to make sure no unexpected surprises were waiting over the horizon 
on december   the boer party reached the zandspruit tributary of the waschbank river it was here that the boer chaplain sarel cilliers first pledged during his nightly sermon that if god helped them defeat the zulus they and their descendents would celebrate that day in honor of god and that they would build a church in commemoration the boers repeated this oath known in afrikaner folklore as the covenant every night until they met the enemy 
there appeared to be no movement from the zulu side on december  pretorius decided to move camp to the buffalo river hoping to provoke the zulus by moving farther into their territory that day he sent out two patrols one under the command of his deputy commandant hans de lange and another under the scotsman edward parker this latter group saw action when they came upon a small group of zulus they killed the warriors and took the women prisoner 
pretorius drew up a message for dingaan on a white cloth explaining that he was leading a commando to punish the zulus if however dingaan was willing to cooperate pretorius wrote he was still willing to make peacea generous offer in light of the earlier betrayal he freed the prisoners and told them to give the message to dingaan he received no answer 
on december  the boers spotted zulus and what appeared to be a large number of cattle near their camp piet uys had been tricked by such a ploy at the battle of italeni zulu warriors crouching behind toughened animalskin shields looked like cattle from a distance and uys dropped his guard he was killed in a surprise attack by the cattle 
pretorius did not make the same mistake and he sent a strong mounted unit to investigate the cattle they turned out to be zulus and in the short fight that followed the boers killed eight warriors but suffered no casualties pretorius now suspected that the zulus were preparing for battle 
on december  he moved the boer camp to a position alongside the ncome river itself a tributary of the buffalo river a scouting expedition that day confirmed the presence of two huge zulu armies a short distance away 
pretorius prepared for battle his men drew the wagons into a dshaped formation one side overlooking a large hippopotamus path facing the ncome river another side facing a soil erosion ditch and the third side facing the open plain pretorius chose the site to limit the directions from which the zulus could attack 
the laager was large enough to contain all the horses and oxen the defenders tied the wagons together with leather ropes and closed off all openings between and below the wagons with a pretorius innovation socalled fighting gates which were slatted wood fixtures through which defenders could fire they left two small openings sealed with removable fighting gates so cavalry could leave the laager finally they attached lanterns to the ends of large oxwhips planted upright in the ground these dangled in front of the laager and were to serve as forward lighting during the dark hours when zulu usually attacked zulus captured after the battle said they had believed the lights waving in the breeze above the boer camp were spirits and that fear of the spirits kept them from attacking that night 
battle is joined 
in pretoriuss own account of the battle he wrote that as the mist cleared on the morning of december  he saw that the boer camp was completely encircled by tens of thousands of zulu warriors even where the terrain would have made an attack difficult estimates placed the number of zulus at between  and  although no official count was possible whatever the figure pretorius wrote that it was a terrible sight 
the boers had been ready and armed since two hours before daybreak the two cannon were in position and the fighting gates closed the defenders expected to run out of ammunition for the cannon and had stacked up suitably sized stones at strategic points along the perimeter to fire as a last resort the boers would fire stones that day 
the front lines of the zulu force were still squatting only about  paces from the wagons waiting for the signal to attack pretorius decided to strike first at his signal three bursts of fire from the boer guns and two blasts from the cannon broke the silence the boers orders were to then hold their fire as the billows of gunpowder smoke lifted they saw that the surviving zulus had fled some  paces from their former front line leaving behind dozens of dying and dead comrades 
the boers then heard the noise of the zulus breaking their spear shafts to make them into short stabbing weapons a frontal assault was coming a few minutes later the zulu force stormed the wagons screaming wildly shields held high and assegais in readiness withering gunfire ripped through the zulu ranks and while some managed to reach the wagons they were gunned down before they could cut through the wagon canvasses 
another group of zulus tried to attack from inside the erosion ditch by standing on each others shoulders and scrambling over the edge pretorius ordered cilliers the fighting churchman to see off the attack he led a group of men out of the relative safety of the wagon perimeter and they proceeded to kill some  zulus one boer philip fourie was wounded when an assegai struck him in the side 
the boers then wheeled one of their cannon out of the laager pointed it into the ditch and fired a shot that literally blew apart the assaulting party the survivors fled the ditch in disarray this sparked a temporary retreat by the zulu and marked the end of the second unsuccessful attempt to break the boer lines the wounded boer fourie returned to the wagon circle for treatment 
as the zulus waited for new orders pretorius ordered another burst of cannon fire into their ranks provoking a spontaneous charge against the wagons although it was the longest single assault of the ninehour battle it was utterly defeated as the boers cut down wave after wave of attackers gun barrels got so hot men had to hold them with wet cloths for reloading 
as the third attack fell back the boers launched their first surprise counterattack as the mobile fighting gates swung open and a cavalry unit charged the zulu lines shooting from the saddle the boers tried to turn the zulu lines to their left desperate zulu resistance which saw hundreds more of their number killed stopped the encircling action and the boer horsemen rode back to the wagons they regrouped and launched a second attempt driving the zulus further away a third mounted charge finally broke through the zulu lines the boer cavalry then turned and attacked the zulus from the rear pinned between the cavalry and cannon fire from within the wagon circle the main zulu force facing the open plain scattered 
a reserve zulu force tried to cross the ncome river to attack the laager but so many warriors were gunned down that their blood stained the water red pretorius himself then led another cavalry charge from within the laager cut to pieces with thousands dead the zulu army which had courageously charged repeatedly against a betterarmed enemy finally broke ranks and fled 
pretorius divided his cavalry into two units and sent them in pursuit mounted boers killed hundreds of warriors during a threehour chase it was during this pursuit that pretorius was wounded two other boers including fourie suffered nonfatal assegai wounds but these were the only boer casualties an estimated  zulus died on the battlefield and many more died later from wounds 
the aftermath 
early the next morning pretorius ordered the camp broken and marched the commando straight to the zulu kings capital he was confident the zulus no longer posed any significant threat but he hardly expected the sight that awaited him on december  at umgungundhlovo dingaan had fled with his wives and cattle leaving the circular camp of reed huts burning as a symbol of the destruction of zulu power 
on the outskirts of the capital the boers found the skeletons of retief and his men their hands and feet were still bound fast with thongs of ox hide wrote cilliers and in nearly all the corpses a spike as thick as an arm had been forced into the anus so that the point of the spike was in the chest retief who was identified by the remains of a satin vest he had worn still had a leather bag draped over his shoulder bone in it was the treaty signed by dingaan giving the boers the unoccupied land to the north according to one of the boers who saw it the treaty was astonishingly well preservedas if it had been left in a closed box pretoriuss men buried retief and his party on christmas day  
dingaan fled north but was captured by a rival tribe the swazis earlier he had persecuted the swazis and they murdered him in revenge the new zulu king mpande was officially installed in  and confirmed the contents of the treaty with the boers who established their first republic in southern africa also in  in fulfillment of their covenant the boers built a church to mark the blood river victory 
the battle of blood river entered the afrikaner psyche as a divinelyinspired victory and december  became a public holiday in south africa celebrated each year with festivals church services and reenactments the battle represented the victory of european civilization over the darkness of africa of christianity over heathens it helped justify white supremacy and the selfappointed right of afrikaners to rule over not apart from the black tribes 
yet the battle of blood river in many ways symbolized all that was wrong with the white settlement of southern africa and why that experiment failed the boers are to be praised for wanting to settle unoccupied land peacefully and for seeking the friendship of neighboring peoples but neither they nor their descendents understood that demography is the arbiter of nations those who form the majority population of a territory will rule that territory no matter how powerful a ruling elite may be they will determine its culture and society a majorityeuropean population will create a society that reflects european values and norms a majorityafrican population will create a society that reflects african norms 
the boers never understood this even at the battle of blood river they had at least  black servants and an indeterminate number of mixedrace servants who helped load weapons parker one of the scotsman had more than  black servants 
to the present day the overwhelming majority of afrikaners have black servants who work on farms in factories and in homes afrikaners failed to understand that by giving the native population the benefits of european civilization blacks would grow in numbers and overwhelm their society the cape colony and the original boer republics which were largely uninhabited by natives when they were settled by europeans are today home to tens of millions of africans 
the church of the vow built by the boers in  still stands in the town of pietermaritzburg named after piet retief but pietermaritzburg supposedly the symbol of the boer victory over the zulus is today part of a municipality called umgungundhlovo named after dingaans capital it is also the capital of the south african province of kwazulu natal and its population is more than  percent black 
the church of the vow stands alone graffitiscarred and abandoned in a dirty downtown slum its decay illustrates the fatal error made by the victors of the battle of blood river that of ignoring the demographics of race if whites had taken possession of those unoccupied lands and kept them for themselves alone the history of south africa would have been entirely different 
if the boers had inhabited and worked their own land rather than rely on black labor the states they created might still be strong and independent today their decision to use nonwhite labor was a critical error that undid all of the sacrifices of the early pioneers 
the only way to maintain a civilization is for the majority to occupy its own land with its own people and to do its own manual labor this law governs the rise and fall of civilizations and the victors of blood river ignored it to their cost",amren.com,Fake,english,16.093066489392562,11.326876277819148,92,12,24249,4212,4.72934472934473,4212.0,0.9184982212091758,0.3616742515005802,5.627492975041639,5.825116636321779,-0.3550649712827892,5.972902997368255,0.0011870845204178,0.0,0.0007122507122507,0,1,0.0,0.00220781832375,-0.9999,0.081,0.155,0.764,Negative,Very Strong

Activist Post,florida voters approve medical marijuana reject federal prohibition,"on october    pm  
one thing that has continuously dogged the donald trump for president campaign is the fact that racists antisemites xenophobes misogynists and various other bigots have stuck with the bombastic real estate mogul since he first launched his travesty of a campaign no matter how much trumps people try to say he doesnt want the support of such folks the candidate himself refuses to take the fact that there is anything about the campaign he has been running that attracts these people seriously so naturally when trumps campaign manager kellyanne conway sat down with an interview with cnns jake tapper on sunday  that particular issue came up again of course conway was not happy tapper began 
there are a lot of antisemites and racists and misogynists who support the trump candidacy 
conway immediately went on defense saying wow tapper went on to reference a man who was shouting jewsa at the press pen at a recent trump rally and directly asked conway if she would refer to such people as deplorable she responded 
yes i would wow i have to push back on some of the adjectives you just used to describe  i hope youve been to trump rallies and i hope that youve seen the tens of thousands i mean hes had over half a million people easily i think in excess of that these are usaloving americans 
tapper went on to say that no he isnt putting all trump supporters into that camp but went on to force conways hand on this one 
but without question people who are experts on hate groups say that there has been a comfort level that has been offered to people who are antisemitic that has been offered to people who are antisemitic and racists and on and on and these people are comfortable coming out in the open and supporting mr trump 
mr trump has refused to condemn in a very serious way his racist and antisemitic fans tapper continued he just has he says things like oh sure i disavow i disavow but he has never serious said i dont want the support of those people they are reprehensible they have nothing to do with me he has never seriously done it 
conway used the pushing to pivot back to the idea that the trump campaign is winning saying 
i think this exchange is frankly the best piece of evidence i have that were actually going to win in nine days because the idea that were going to shift away from the pattern of corruption the cloud of ethical stain that hillary clinton would bring to the oval office in such an important week 
no kellyanne its not a sign that trump is winning its pointing something out that has been true since this whole fiasco began that donald trump is a raging bigot and he has been so openly dog whistles have turned into fog horns this election cycle and its all because of donald trump he embraces these bigots because hes one of them the quicker you learn that the better

marlene,comment on are the obamas the clintons and the bushes going to seek refuge in countries that dont extradite to the us if trump wins by marlene,"posted on october   by claire bernish 
tony podesta  brother of the nowdisgraced hillary clinton campaign chair john podesta  whose files wikileaks has been publishing  is not only a powerful democratic party lobbyist but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of saudi arabia 
no  as tinfoilhat conspiracy theorist as it might sound  that scenario is the absolute truth 
in  john and tony podesta formed the podesta group and have used their bigwig partyinsider status to lobby and influence government policies  while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power  which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest 
according to the march  filing made in accordance with the foreign agents registration act of  tony podesta is an active foreign agent of the saudi government with the  center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court  and acts as an officer of the saudi arabia account 
at this point the web of payforplay between the washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight 
for starters the podesta brothers lobbying firm receives  every month from the saudi government which in no uncertain terms  and despite a status as privileged us ally  wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations 
john podesta previously served as president bill clintons chief of staff founded the think tank center for american progress which ohsocoincidentally touts the need to reframe saudi arabias hopelessly tarnished image counseled president obama and now chairs hillary clintons campaign 
tony podesta acts as a foreign agent for the kingdom of saudi arabia  lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the kingdom  while also contributing to and bundling for hillary clintons campaign 
think about that for a moment 
one brother uses the influence of money to both affect united states foreign policy and infuse the clinton campaign with cash  while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities 
as the washington post reported months ago in july tony podestas lobbying efforts raised  for the campaign and  for the victory fund 
the saudis hired the podesta group in  because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger raif badawi to ten years in prison and  lashes for insulting islam alternet reported  since then tony podestas fingerprints have been all over saudi arabias advocacy efforts in washington dc when saudi arabia executed the prominent nonviolent shia dissident sheikh nimr alnimr causing protests throughout the shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions the new york times noted that the podesta group provided the newspaper with a saudi commentator who defended the execution 
notably the saudis reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up  concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant usbacked coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict 
additionally tony podestas status as a registered foreign agent for saudi arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from april    ironically revealed by wikileaks publishing of his brothers personal communiques  in which former clinton foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director dennis cheng wrote to a small group of insiders 
hi all  we do need to make a decision on this asap as our friends who happen to be registered with fara foreign agents registration act are already donating and raising 
i do want to push back a bit its my job i feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table both for primary and general and then dnc and state parties and how do we explain to people that well take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them that the foundation takes  from foreign govts but we now wont either way we need to make a decision soon 
to which general counsel to the clinton campaign attorney marc elias replied all errors original and emphasis added 
responding to all on this i was not on the call this morning but i lean away from a bright line rule here it seems odd to say that someone who represents alberta canada cant give but a lobbyist for phillip morris can just as we vet lobbyists case by case i would do the same with fara while this may lead to a large number of fara registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban a total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eyerolling and ill will that it did for obama 
as the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaigns image with potentially controversial donors  while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash  becomes even more apparent as strategist and campaign manager robby mook responds 
where do we draw the line though 
elias suggests a particularly intricate solution 
if we do it case by case then it will be subjective we would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for in judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the united states its relationship to the state department during hillarys time as secretary and its relationship if any to the foundation in judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and hillarys past campaigns specifically 
put simply we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists except with a somewhat more stringent screen 
as a legal matter i am not saying we have to do this  we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely im just offering this up as a middle ground 
mook eventually decides plainly 
marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions dont really get you anythingthat obama actually got judged more harshly as a result he convinced me soin a complete uturn im ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks are you guys ok with that 
all of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect  despite increasing calls for the united states to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody saudi regime  the us approved a stunning  billion sale of smart bombs to the kingdom in november  
tony podestas specific contract with the governmentrun center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court which will earn  million by years end does indeed suggest the infusion of a prosaudi message into the us media propaganda machine 
saudi arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in washington sunlight foundation spokesman josh stewart told the washington post  that spans both what youd call the inside game which is lobbying and government relations and the outside game which is pr and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying 
that broader audience  the american public  has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughlycorrupt clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the saudis as well 
as the free thought project has repeatedly reported  the evidence of collusion among the democratic national committee hillary clintons campaign and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable  including no less than  socalled journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign 
although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet and yet at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the white house  who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts

No Author,accusing two young men in alqatif,"email 
queen elizabeth ii is not like you and me 
did you know she is immune from prosecution that she has her own personal poet paid in sherry wine or that she holds dominion over british swans and can fire the entire australian government 
its true that her role as the british head of state is largely ceremonial and the monarch no longer holds any serious power from day to day the historic prerogative powers of the sovereign have been devolved largely to government ministers but this still means that when the british government declares war or regulates the civil service or signs a treaty it is doing so only on her authority 
and she still wields some of these prerogative powers herself  as well as numerous other unique powers ranging from the surprising to the utterly bizarre 
most famously she owns all swans in the river thames 
technically all unmarked swans in open water belong to the queen though the crown exercises her ownership only on certain stretches of the thames and its surrounding tributaries according to the official website of the royal family 
today this tradition is observed during the annual swan upping in which swans in the river thames are caught ringed and set free again as part of census of the swan population 
its a highly ceremonial affair taking place over five days swan uppers wear traditional uniforms and row upriver in six skiffs accompanied by the queens swan marker 
the swans are also given a health check and ringed with individual identification numbers by the queens swan warden a professor of ornithology at the university of oxfords department of zoology according to the royal family website 
rule britannia britannia rules the waves goes a classic british song  and this rule extends beneath the waves too the sovereign has dominion over a variety of aquatic animals in british waters 
the queen still technically owns all the sturgeons whales and dolphins in the waters around england and wales in a rule that dates back to a statute from  during the reign of king edward ii according to time 
according to the article this statute is still valid today and sturgeons porpoises whales and dolphins are recognised as fishes royal when they are captured within  miles about  km of uk shores or wash ashore they may be claimed on behalf of the crown generally when brought into port a sturgeon is sold in the usual way and the purchaser as a gesture of loyalty requests the honour of its being accepted by elizabeth 
the law is still observed in  a welsh fisherman was investigated by the police after catching a foot sturgeon the bbc reported at the time the scottish government also issued guidance on the law in  writing that the right to claim royal fish in scotland allows the scottish government on behalf of the crown to claim stranded whales which are too large to be drawn to land by a wain pulled by six oxen 
the queen can drive without a licence 
driving licenses are issued in the queens name yet she is the only person in the united kingdom who doesnt legally need a license to drive or a number plate on her cars according to time 
despite not being required to have a license the queen is comfortable behind the wheel having learned to drive during world war ii when she operated a firstaid truck for the womens auxillary territorial service as a result of the queens training she can also change a spark plug time notes 
queen elizabeth ii isnt afraid to show off her driving skills either in  she surprised king abdullah of saudi arabia then still a prince by driving him around in her country seat of balmoral 
former british ambassador sherard cowpercoles recounted the meeting in the sunday times as instructed the crown prince climbed into the front seat of the front land rover with his interpreter in the seat behind to his surprise the queen climbed into the driving seat turned the ignition and drove off women are not  yet  allowed to drive in saudi arabia and abdullah was not used to being driven by a woman let alone a queen 
cowpercoles continued his nervousness only increased as the queen an army driver in wartime accelerated the land rover along the narrow scottish estate roads talking all the time through his interpreter the crown prince implored the queen to slow down and concentrate on the road ahead 
unlike other members of the royal family the queen does not require a passport as they are issued in her name despite this lack of travel documents she has been abroad many times 
she has two birthdays 
when youre the british head of state one birthday just isnt enough the queens official birthday is celebrated on a saturday in june though her actual birthday is on april  
official celebrations to mark a sovereigns birthday have often been held on a day other than the actual birthday particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer according to the royal mint 
both birthdays are celebrated in suitable style too her actual birthday is marked publicly by gun salutes in central london at midday according to the official website of the british monarchy this includes a gun salute in hyde park a gun salute in windsor great park and a gun salute at the tower of london in  her majesty celebrated her th birthday in  with a walkabout in the streets outside of windsor castle to meet wellwishers 
for her official birthday celebrations meanwhile she is joined by other members of the royal family at the spectacular trooping the colour parade which moves between buckingham palace the mall and horseguards parade 
she has her own private cash machine 
less a power and more a perk of the job a private cash machine for use by the royal family is installed in the basement of buckingham palace its provided by coutts one of britains most prestigious  and exclusive  banks 
the queen has her own personal poet 
the poet laureate is an honorary position in british society appointed by the monarch to a poet whose work is of national significance according to the official website of the british monarchy when first the role was introduced the appointee was paid  per year plus a butt of canary wine today the poet laureate is given a barrel of sherry 
carol ann duffy will hold the position until  
she has to sign laws 
the queens consent is necessary to turn any bill into an actual law once a proposed law has passed both houses of parliament it makes its way to the palace for approval which is called royal assent the most recent british monarch to refuse to provide royal assent was queen anne back in  
royal assent is different than queens consent in which the queen must consent to any law being debated in parliament that affects the monarchys interests such as reforming the prerogative or tax laws that might affect the duchy of cornwall for example without consent the bill cannot be debated in parliament 
queens consent is exercised only on the advice of ministers but its existence provides the government with a tool for blocking debate on certain subjects if bills are tabled by backbench rebels or the opposition 
it has been exercised at least  times according to documents released under the freedom of information act including one instance in which the queen completely vetoed the military actions against iraq bill in  a private members bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against iraq from the monarch to parliament the guardian reported in  
she can create lords 
the queen has the power to appoint lords who can then sit in parliament the upper house in britains legislative system like many other powers this is exercised only on the advice of elected government ministers 
she doesnt have to pay tax but she does anyway 
the queen does not have to pay tax but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since  
the queen has the power to form governments 
unlike the queen prime minister david cameron doesnt literally sit on a throne rob stothardgetty imageshbobi 
the queen previously wielded the power to dissolve parliament and call a general election but the fixedterm parliaments act put an end to that in  now a twothirds vote in the commons is required to dissolve parliament before a fiveyear fixedterm is up 
she does still play a part after an election however when she calls on the mp most able to form a government to do so 
this caused some worry ahead of this years general election it once looked as if the conservatives might not have a majority but would be the largest party and would try to form a government meanwhile it was feasible that labour could form a majority despite having fewer seats by entering into a coalition with multiple other parties 
in this situation the queen would have been stuck between a rock and a hard place every year she opens parliament with the queens speech which lays out the governments plans but to give david camerons speech would arguably be to tacitly endorse his government  while staying away would send the opposite message 
at one point the times was told by sources that she planned to stay away if cameron failed to secure enough mps but the palace later had an aboutface royal sources confirmed she would lead proceedings even if there was a risk the speech would be overthrown the following week because the tories had failed to muster enough backing from smaller parties the times subsequently reported 
she has knights 
sure they no longer ride around on horseback wooing maidens with their tales of valour but britain still retains knights like lords they are appointed by the queen  and she knights them personally 
knighthoods are typically given to figures who have made a particular contribution to british society  whether in business the arts the military or elsewhere after terry pratchett was knighted the legendary fantasy author forged himself a special sword using pieces of a meteorite 
the individuals knighted are decided by ministers the bbc reports who present her with a list of nominees each year for her approval 
she is exempt from freedom of information requests 
all information about the royal family is exempt from freedom of information requests the exemption was made after a legal battle between the guardian and the government to have letters from prince charles sent to whitehall ministers made public the socalled black spider memos were recently released but the change means the same cant happen in the future 
she can ignore or overrule ministerial advice in grave constitutional crisis 
while the overwhelming majority of the queens prerogative powers are devolved to her ministers there is one exception that allows her to wield power herself only in grave constitutional crisis the sovereign can act contrary to or without ministerial advice with no precedent in modern times its not clear what would actually constitute this but the possibility remains 
the queen holds the ability to fire the entire australian government 
as the head of state in australia the queen has certain powers over the government in  for example the queens representative in the country at the time gov gen sir john kerr fired the prime minister in response to a government shutdown 
kerr appointed a replacement who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government max fisher wrote in the washington post three hours later kerr dismissed the rest of parliament then australia held elections to restart from scratch and they havent had another shutdown since 
in addition to the uk and australia the queen is also the head of state in antigua and barbuda the bahamas barbados belize canada grenada jamaica new zealand papua new guinea saint kitts and nevis saint lucia saint vincent and the grenadines solomon islands and tuvalu 
all the above are commonwealth realms or former british colonies the british sovereign retains the position she holds in the united kingdom that of head of state as in britain this is largely a ceremonial role from day to day 
shes the head of a religion 
queen elizabeth ii is the head of the church of england britains state religion first established after king henry viii split away from the catholic church in rome in the th century 
her formal title is defender of the faith and supreme governor of the church of england and she also has the power to appoint bishops and archbishops as with many of her other powers however this is exercised only on the advice of the prime minister who himself takes advice from a church commission 
an interesting side effect of this is that the sovereign must be a confirmed member of church of england catholics and those of other religions may not ascend to the british throne if prince charles converted to islam for example he would be unable to become king after queen elizabeth ii dies 
she gets to give away special money to the elderly 
maundy money is a special kind of silver coin the queen gives away to pensioners every year at a uk cathedral every easter in a special ceremony the number of recipients corresponds with the sovereigns age this year for example she will be  when easter rolls around so she will give maundy money away to  pensioners 
the coins are technically legal tender despite coming in unconventional pence and pence denominations but given the coins rare status they tend not to enter general circulation 
shes also immune from prosecution 
all prosecutions are carried out in the name of the sovereign and she is both immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court 
in theory the sovereign is incapable of thinking or doing wrong legal scholar john kirkhope told business insider however barrister baroness helena kennedy qc told the bbc in  that nowadays that immunity is questionable 
although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the sovereign as a person under uk law the queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law according to official site of the monarchy 
if the monarch did commit a grievance offence he or she would almost certainly be forced to abdicate there is at least one precedent of the courts prosecuting the sovereign in the th century king charles i was tried for treason following the english civil war he said no earthly power can justly call me who am your king in question as a delinquent the court disagreed and had him executed 
the queen has the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her ministers 
assuming no grave constitutional crisis the queens input into the legislative process is supposed to be limited in real terms to the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her ministers  advice delivered via meetings with the prime minister 
the queen also has certain historic rights and privileges john kirkhope a lawyer who successfully campaigned to have details of queens consent made public provided business insider with a list of some of the stranger rights the queen still holds 
hungerford has to present a red rose to the sovereign in exchange for its fishing and grazing rightsthe duke of atholl must pay by way of a rose whenever the sovereign calls this most recently happened during the reign of queen victoria so its unclear whether the rose has to be any particular colourif the sovereign passes near kidwelly castle in wales the tenant has to provide a bodyguard in full armour this is complicated slightly by the fact the castle is a ruinthe marquis of ailesbury owns savernake forest and is required to produce a blast on a hunting horn should the sovereign pass through the forest this last happened in similarly the owner of dunlambert castle in northern ireland has to produce a blast on an ancient bugleand lastly many landowners must also pay a quitrent  a kind of tax on their property paid to the monarch some are pretty unusual

No Author,the toronto star published an unauthorized database of things that will infuriate trump  addicting info  the knowledge you crave,"on november    pm  
as if the election of donald trump couldnt get even more disastrous and hypocritical senator lindsey graham just called on trump to nominate a rightwing extremist to nations highest court 
all year long republicans have been blocking president obamas nomination of merrick garland to the supreme court because they want the next president to make the pick and because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist 
south carolina senator lindsey graham told wyfftv that trump should pick texas senator ted cruz as the nominee and warned democrats not to block him which is hypocritical considering how republicans have treated president obamas nominee and threatened to block any nominees hillary clinton would have made had she won the election 
im here to tell my democratic colleagues that i voted for obamas nominees i expect them to give trumps nominees a fair shake he won this election he will pick a conservative i would put ted cruz on that list if they try to block this pick they will regret it if you dont honor trumps nominee youre making a huge mistake 
democrats should stand up and give graham a collective middle finger 
since antonin scalia died in february there has been a vacancy on the supreme court bench that has yet to be filled the body wasnt even cold yet before republicans vowed to block any nominee president obama picked to replace him going so far as to even deny garland a confirmation hearing thats far from the fair shake graham is asking democrats to give to a man as dangerous as ted cruz 
putting cruz on the supreme court would guarantee rulings against womens rights and lgbt rights as well as putting laws like the voting rights act and the civil rights act in further peril in no uncertain terms should democrats grant cruz a hearing nor should they respect any of trumps conservative choices for the court republicans should have thought about fair shakes before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the supreme court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than trump again senate republicans didnt even give garland a hearing or a vote they refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards president obama and so thats exactly what democrats should do to trump turnabout is fair play and republicans only have themselves to blame

Daniel Greenfield,hillary clinton tops islamist money in politics list,"wife of fbi official investigating hillary got k from hillary allied pac october   daniel greenfield 
the system is broken its deeply corrupted by insider politics  the situation at the center of power has reached the point of utter unaccountability insider politics function as a shadow government that needs to change restoring america requires dismantling much of the federal government not only for constitutional reasons but because its a simple matter of saving the republic 
hillary clinton headlined a major fundraiser for a political action committee shortly before the group steered nearly  to the wife of the fbi official who oversaw the clinton email investigation dailymailcom has learned 
clintons ties to the common good va  a virginia state pac run by clintons longtime friend and advisor terry mcauliffe its governor  came under scrutiny this week after the wall street journal reported that the group donated heavily to the state senate campaign of jill mccabe 
her husband andrew mccabe led the fbi investigation into clintons emails 
andrew mccabe now the deputy director of the fbi told the wall street journal that he complied with federal ethics rules and was not promoted to lead the clinton probe until months after his wifes unsuccessful state senate bid ended 
common good va was the largest single donor to jill mccabes campaign election records show giving her  between june and october of  
she was the thirdlargest recipient of money from the group which can only contribute to virginia state candidates 
her campaign also received an additional  from the democratic party of virginia a group over which mcauliffe exerts significant control combined the money made up nearly onethird of her total funding 
now mccabe a pediatrician suddenly decided to run for public office unopposed that was certainly nice of the dems to not only put a first timer unopposed but to throw piles and piles of cash at her and some of that cash was coming from a key former clinton foundation man at the center of the latest foundation scandal 
although common good va is only allowed to fund statelevel candidates many of its largest donations came from outside of virginia  including  from clinton foundation official doug band in new york  from clinton loyalist robert johnson in maryland and  from clinton megadonor stephen cloobeck in nevada 
in the following months common good va received several major donations from other close clinton associates including  from bill clintons business partner ron burkle in california and  from ready for hillarys finance committee member leonard lauder in new york

senior white house officials blocked the navy from conducting needed freedom of navigation operations in the south china sea amid growing concerns that china is militarizing newly reclaimed islands according to the pentagons defense policy board 
a working paper produced in september  by john hamre the policy board chairman called for an immediate resumption of navy warship passages to prevent china from taking over the strategic southeast asian waterway 
the internal document was disclosed monday by wikileaks as part of its latest batch of hacked emails from the account of john podesta campaign chairman for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton the obama administration has accused russias seniormost officials of hacking and leaking the emails posted to wikileaks and other sites in order to influence the  election

No Author,intl community still financing protecting terrorists  mother agnes vanessa beeley on syria,"st century wire says 
wire reported on friday about the fbis surprising announcement that it would be reopening the clinton email case due to new evidence of classified information found on sex cheat anthony weiners newly estranged husband of clinton chief aid huma abedin computer which was subject to a seperate investigation will this really yield anything significant in the  days runningup to the nov th election or is this just clever democrat party smoke and mirrors it seems that washingtons political tricksters have already sprung into action 
after comeys shock announcement a leaked memo appeared out of nowhere supplied to fox news  in which comey and the fbi seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control 
elite circles fbi head james comey and friend hillary clinton 
certainly a desperate democratic party and an even more desperate obama white house over the last  weeks obama and his wife michelle have been out campaigning more that hillary clinton herself could be pressuring or nudging the fbi on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against donald trump aside from the obvious potential of another clinton scandal yesterdays fbi move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios protect the president who is already deeply tied to the clinton email coverup democratic party machine has created a distraction to coverup latest wikileaks dump fbi are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring hillary clintons create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious trump scandal next week 
note despite calls from the clinton camp for fbi to disclose what they have which they cannot by law anyway youd think hillary would have already known that it is highly unlikely that the fbi will release any real specifics before the election  if they have anything at all its just too early to tell 
see also fbi james comey was board member of hsbc  clinton foundation  drug cartel bank of choice 
the fbi director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the justice department seek an indictment against clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation  allowing clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election  despite the fact that comey stated to a congressional investigative committee that clinton was extremely careless and that clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the us secretary of state 
zero hedge adds 
now it is the democrats turn to rage at comey and the fbi although comey likely did not have much choice had he kept the information secret it certainly would have leaked as we predicted as such his best recourse was to come clean although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure needless to say all comey would need to do to regain the demcorats trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over 
here is leaked aka just covering my ass memo from fbi director james comey 
watch this space here is a highlight reel of hillary clinton lying on at least  occasions when asked direct questions about her illegal private email server

Frank Face,eng subs  bombardment of residential lugansk village osce records craters,"they knew the end of the clinton lies begins theres only one lie left october   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
during hillary clintons first presidential campaign neera tanden was described as the wonk behind hillary a close associate of the clintons tanden helped shape policy for both bill and hillary then she switched to playing that role for obama 
while hillarys email scandal broke tanden was in charge of the center for american progress a radical leftwing group that had been described as obamas idea factory and she was chatting with john podesta the top clintonite who had founded cap podesta had cochaired the obamabiden transition project neera tanden would cochair the hillarykaine transition project under podesta who headed up hillarys presidential campaign podesta had helped shape the last eight years of national politics through obama and tanden looked forward to shaping the next eight under hillary 
and what did they think of hillary did they believe their defenses of her wrongdoing 
podesta and tanden ridiculed her associates for the coverup why didnt they get this stuff out like  months ago so crazy she wondered unbelievable podesta wrote they wanted to get away with it 
since the early days of the email scandal weve been treated to the sordid rituals of feigned innocence the issue was a nonissue clinton surrogates were quick to assure us and even if it was no one did anything wrong the flies on the wall knew better though and now we can all be the flies on the wall 
away from the cameras and the briefings the clintonites held their bosses in contempt neera tanden a supposed close associate of hillary blasted her instincts as suboptimal and described her as suffering from a character problem and there was never any doubt as to what was going on 
tanden ridiculed cheryl mills for the mess mills fired off an email to podesta warning that obamas denial wouldnt hold up we need to clean this up  he has emails from her  they do not say stategov she warned 
obama had offered his usual denial claiming to have only learned about the scandal from the media the revelation that hillary had emailed obama from her illegal address would show that he had lied but meanwhile his people struggled to reinvent his lie by claiming that while he knew about her illegal address he didnt know that it was illegal this put his lie in line with hillarys lie 
there was only one problem 
when in doubt the clintons take refuge in the final lie that you may be able to prove that they did wrong but not that they meant to do wrong that was hillarys final email defense to the fbi spliced with claims of memory loss due to a concussion was that old sergeant schultz favorite i know nothing 
but that defense completely falls apart once you prove that they did know that is what the leaked emails have begun doing they are establishing that the sergeant schultz defense is utterly hollow 
cheryl mills knew john podesta knew barack obama knew and hillary clinton knew 
when obama told a lie that could easily be disproven while trying to distance himself from hillary mills quickly fired off a warning that he had better get his story straight and his people did that makes obama complicit before and after the fact he knew what hillary was doing when she was doing it and his people participated in the effort to cover it up afterward not just to protect her but to protect him 
hillary clinton was not a rogue actor she was part of an administration that had waged a war on transparency even media allies had dubbed it as the least transparent administration in history 
lies censorship and targeting whistleblowers were the norm for obama inc a new york times reporter dubbed it the greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation the washington post noted that the obama administration routinely makes a mockery of its longago pledge to establish itself as the most transparent administration in us history the ap pointed out that it more often than ever censored government files or outright denied access to them 
bizarre administration email dodges included epa boss lisa jackson using richard windsor as her alias jacksonwindsor left the epa and took a seat on the board of the clinton foundation 
tanden and podesta didnt take issue with hillary clinton breaking the law but with her clumsy political instincts her inability to fake sincere apologies and spin scandals as smoothly as obama hillarys biggest flaw in their eyes was her clumsiness at covering up acts that were routine in in obamaworld they didnt despise her because she broke the law but because she was bad at it 
that made her a threat to their political futures 
hillarys clumsy instincts led her to the point of having to admit what she did while denying having intended to do it motive is simultaneously the strongest and weakest defense you can prove what someone else did but it is hard to prove what someone else meant to do 
unless you have their emails 
this is hillarys firewall its what every painful trickle of the scandal was meant to drag out and delay every partial revelation is buying time while bringing us closer to the final breach in the motive wall 
what the podesta emails tell us is that they knew those around hillary knew and those around them knew that the inner circle knew they knew and they hated hillary for being a bad liar and now as the inside drama of clintonworld spills across the internet the red queen moves closer to being in check 
by making it all about motive hillary clinton turned personal communications particularly emails into the key instrument of culpability that is why podestas emails are such a hot commodity its why her emails are becoming an even bigger prize 
neera tanden was right hillary clintons political instincts are suboptimal she is the member of the obama graduating class voted least likely to be able to lie convincingly on national television and she has a perverse knack for dragging everyone around her into her scandals while exposing their own 
we know that her people knew that she lied we know that obama lied all thats left is her final lie",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,43.52880693399604,73,10,6216,1078,4.738404452690167,1078.0,0.337572473690605,-0.0141271790859303,0.8564720586179211,0.9120050402618328,-0.3461239128338168,0.9449247794722002,0.0074211502782931,0.0,0.0018552875695732,0,5,0.0,0.0161748002360087,-0.9988,0.061,0.151,0.788,Negative,Very Strong

George Zapo,volunteers succeed at eliminating food waste and hunger,"keywords alzhemiers disease  anxiety  dementia  depression  food  health  ibd  ibs  immune system  mental health  nutrition  weight loss fermented foods  reasons to consume this food group every day 
im sure you have heard about fermented foods and are wondering if this is just a fad here are some reasons why fermented foods should not be just a fad but a food group to keep in your diet daily what are fermented foods 
bacteria and yeast are used as part of the fermentation process that gives these foods a nutritional boost the bacteria convert sugars and starches into lactic acid through a process called lactofermentation the yeast undergoes a process called ethanol fermentation 
these yeasts and bacteria that undergo the fermentation process boosts the nutritional content of the food what it does to the food provides beneficial bacteria that promote gut health provides beneficial enzymes increases the amount of b vitamins biotin and folate increases the bioavailability of minerals provides short chain fatty acids which helps to improve your immune function provides you with gaba your calming neurotransmitter how can eating fermented foods help me optimize your gut health 
why this may not seem like a big deal it is your immune system is in your gut and much of your serotonin is made in your gut your gut may be in bad shape from nsaids antibiotics unknown food allergies the standard american diet and more 
ideally you want more good bacteria populating your gut as opposed to bad bacteria fermented foods can help shift the balance since most people who consume the standard american crap food diet have a disrupted microbiome 
so you can take all the supplements in the world but if your gut is in bad shape are you even absorbing and benefiting from these supplements or are you just wasting your money 
a healthy gut can help to balance and support your endocrine system immune system digestive system and nervous system so as you can see a healthy gut is critical to your wellbeing support your immune system 
the more beneficial bacteria you have the stronger your immune system is to fight off colds flu allergies and more almost  of your immune system is found in your gut thus it stands to reason that to maintain a strong immune system one needs to support their gut health 
asthma and autoimmune conditions among numerous other health issues are all linked to having fewer good bacteria in your gut the less diverse your microbiota is the greater association with many chronic health issues 
adding in probiotic rich fermented foods can also shorten the duration of a cold or upper respiratory infection aid in weight loss 
studies show that those with certain healthy bacteria in their gut can maintain a healthy weight while those with more negative strains have a greater incidence of gaining weightdifficulty losing weight obese people have different gut bacteria than lean individuals 
in a  study it was found that kimchee had a significant impact on weight and body fat of those who are overweight and obese in the study in a  study obese people were assigned to drink fermented milk for  weeks those that drank the fermented milk had significant fat loss as compared to the control group digestivebowel issue improvement 
those with ibs or ibd may have reduced symptoms of diarrhea and constipation when fermented foods are added into the daily diet dr david williams states that to eliminate digestive issues you need to improve the balance in the gut microbiome and one of the most effective ways of doing so is by adding in fermented foods kefir in studies has shown to improve symptoms of ibs and ibd research has shown that anywhere from  to  of those who make this change adding in fermented foods will notice a significant difference in their ibs symptoms improved mental health mood control and behavior 
the gut is considered your second brain a healthy gut therefore can mean a healthy brain several probiotic strains have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in short term studies for this reason to get more variety of probiotic strains it is best to not stick with the same fermented food to eat over and over mix it up for instance have kefir one day kombucha the next fermented vegetables the next day and so forth 
many of you know that gaba is your calming neurotransmitter but did you know that fermented foods can supply you with gaba too oral administration of fermented rice bran and other traditional fermented foods have been shown to increase gaba content significantly whereas gaba in the oral form may have limited benefits due to absorption issues 
another study looking at  college students found that those who ate a variety of fermented foods has less negative emotions than before such as anxiety fear moodiness worry envy frustration and loneliness 
it is possible that the fermented foods not only healed leaky gut but also provided some needed gaba even in psychiatry they are starting to recognize the benefits of fermented foods for mood disorders reduce the risk of brain diseases such as alzheimers 
some scientists have recently begun to consider the possibility that alzheimers disease is in fact an autoimmune disease and as many of you may know having one autoimmune condition puts you at risk for more autoimmune conditions down the road for any autoimmune disease the immune system must be supported so it would make sense that gut health needs to be addressed for ad if you want to support your brain than i suggest that you add in fermented foods 
along with the benefits above fermented foods can also benefit those with autism and help prevent hpylori you dont need a whole lot of fermented foods daily start with small amounts until you know how your body will react and slowly build your way up to say  tablespoons of fermented vegetables or a cup of kefir per day what to add in 

look for the product to say raw and fermented these foods should be in the refrigerator section of the store sauerkraut or other fermented vegetables  eat these cold dont heat them up bubbies pickles is a great way to get introduced to fermented foods kimchee  this is a korean version of fermented cabbage carrots onions and garlic kefir usually made from cows milk but is also made from goat milk or coconut milk it has more of a drinkable texture than yogurt i buy goat milk kefir and find that it is relatively thick and mix in some of my paleo granola and have this for breakfast if you suspect any issues with milk it is best to opt for the coconut kefir or the goat milk kefir if you have asthma or chronic sinus congestion avoid the kefir until issues resolve opt for the other fermented choices instead tempeh indonesian type of cake with a nutty taste and chewy texture a good vegan source of protein too kombucha  a fizzy fermented tea most stores carry a variety of flavors now dont go overboard on the kombucha however some people who drink kombucha in excess amounts ie several bottles per day report symptoms of gas and bloating miso a fermented soybean paste which can be used in soups and sauces a miso broth soup is a great way to start a meal and very easy to make 
notice i did not sat yogurt while some yogurts may contain some probiotics many others are sugary processed foods in disguise yogurt is also not going to pack as powerful of a punch as the abovementioned foods

Corbett,after the selection  new world next week," at  am 
even after the election the clinton side continues with lawless agitation intimidation and violence in the streets demonstrating to reasonable people everywhere that americans did make the right choice thank you msm and mr soros for showing everyone just how free democratic big hearted and open the globalist new world order would really be if hillary had won 
if the us election rules had been that the candidates had to win the popular vote in order to be elected then trump would have campaigned more vigorously in the large cities and likely also would have won that contest in a landslide but how much more of a landslide that would have been can be seen by considering what really happened 
the people who supported trump mainly voted for jobs and to save core values and constitutional rights from a misguided globalism being imposed upon them they were essentially voting to save their nation from an establishment which has been systematically outsourcing just about everything which matters to them however despite the stakes they were and remain essentially principled people adhering to the electoral rules of fair play for lawful democratic change the clinton side on the other hand appeared devoid of any real principles other than their own interests during the election the clinton side used intimidation tactics of paid agitators they cheated by swelling voters lists by opening the border and signing up droves of illegal immigrants even voter fraud and rigged voting machines were acceptable to them but most of all they were supported by an absolutely biased corrupt and lying mainstream media the effect of the media was so pervasive that trump supporters were generally so ridiculed and shunned that few made their views known without such dishonest illegal and oppressive tactics by the clinton side the trump vote would most certainly have been much much greater in the circumstances the clinton loss could not be more embarrassing for her her party and the msm

the figures suggest that animals living in lakes rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses 
human activity including habitat loss wildlife trade pollution and climate change contributed to the declines 
dr mike barrett head of science and policy at wwf said its pretty clear under business as usual we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations but i think now weve reached a point where there isnt really any excuse to let this carry on 
we know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations  it really is now down to us to act 
however the methodology of the report has been criticised image copyright carlos drews  wwf image caption the report looked at data collected on  species of vertebrates over the last  years 
the living planet report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the worlds wildlife 
for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  dr mike barrett wwf 
this analysis looked at  different species of birds fish mammals amphibians and reptiles  about  of the total number of vertebrate species in the world 
the team collected data from peerreviewed studies government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and ngos 
any species with population data going back to  with two or more time points to show trends was included in the study 
the researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time 
some of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data there are many records on arctic and near arctic birds for example or very little data tropical amphibians for example the report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture 
the last report published in  estimated that the worlds wildlife populations had halved over the last  years 
this assessment suggests that the trend has continued since  populations have declined by an average of  
dr barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others 
we do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment  for freshwater species alone the decline stands at  since  this is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building for example 
it also highlighted other species such as african elephants  which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching and sharks which are threatened by overfishing 
if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse dr robin freeman zsl 
the researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of  each year and warn that if nothing is done wildlife populations could fall by  below  levels by the end of the decade 
dr robin freeman head of zsls indicators  assessments unit said but thats assuming things continue as we expect if pressures  overexploitation illegal wildlife trade for example  increase or worsen then that trend may be worse 
but one of the things i think is most important about these stats these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations  they are not extinctions by and large they are not vanishing and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it image copyright scott dickerson image caption there are still many gaps in our knowledge of the worlds vertebrates 
however living planet reports have drawn some criticisms 
there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy stuart pimm duke university 
stuart pimm professor of conservation ecology at duke university in the united states said that while wildlife was in decline there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure 
there are some numbers in the report that are sensible but there are some numbers that are very very sketchy he told bbc news 
for example if you look at where the data comes from not surprisingly it is massively skewed towards western europe 
when you go elsewhere not only do the data become far fewer but in practice they become much much sketchier there is almost nothing from south america from tropical africa there is not much from the tropics period any time you are trying to mix stuff like that it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean 
theyre trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number its flawed 
but dr freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world 
its completely true that in some regions and in some groups like tropical amphibians for example we do have a lack of data but thats because there is a lack of data 
were confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline 
its entirely possible that species that arent being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse  but id be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed",amren.com,Fake,english,16.093066489392562,11.326876277819148,58,9,5463,925,4.833513513513513,925.0,-0.1210531164556349,-0.2020278943791856,0.6572495914706323,0.6721498793820716,-0.2522605972087692,0.6994618990197126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9205,0.093,0.082,0.825,Positive,Very Strong
André du Pôle,men are binded by their shared realization of truth,"home  badge abuse  cop fired after shooting own yearold daughter at a halloween party cop fired after shooting own yearold daughter at a halloween party matt agorist november   leave a comment 
lincolnton nc  time and again police prove that the government having a monopoly on the use of weapons is a terrible idea a glaring example of this incompetence is evidenced through a recent case in north carolina in which a police officer shot her own daughter 
on monday the lincoln county sheriffs office announced that deputy misty michelle flowers  was terminated after she shot her yearold daughter over the weekend 
the shooting happened as flowers who is entrusted by the state to act responsibly with a firearm was showing off her service weapon to friends saturday night when she squeezed the trigger the bullet then went through the wall and hit her daughter in another room 
i find gross negligence and the disregard for the safety of others was displayed in the incident saturday night and therefore officer flowers was terminated today sheriff david carpenter said this is totally separate from the sbi investigation into the incident that occurred at her residence 
according to wncn 
lincoln county deputies said they were called to the home at  pm and started tending to the girls injury the child was taken to chslincoln and then airlifted to carolinas medical center in charlotte for surgery according to deputies she was in stable condition after treatment 
neighbors say there was a halloween party going on at the house where this happened 
flowers has been with the lincoln county sheriffs office since  and worked for the catawba county sheriffs office before that 
during this entire situation my focus has been on the wellbeing and condition of the child involved and am of the understanding the child is going to be ok after the surgery this is a very tragic situation for all involved the officer her family her career and everyone that has been touched by this carpenter said we continue to pray for healing of the child and the entire family as the investigation continues over the next several days 
according to the sbi an investigation into the incident is still ongoing it is unclear whether or not flowers will face any charges 
this is the second such incident in only a week in which a police officer accidentally fired their weapon endangering the lives of children last week the free thought project reported on the ohio cop who fired his weapon into a daycare center while it was fully occupied 
despite the officer clearly admitting to committing the misdemeanor offense of discharging a firearm within city limits police have yet to charge him 
right now our law department has it and they are reviewing it to see if there should be any charges police chief jack davis said last wednesday morning 
it was a very unfortunate incident for the school as well as him he added 
outside of skating out of the misdemeanor charge so far this officer also seems to be avoiding the felony offense of discharging a weapon in a gunfree school zone 
imagine for a moment that you were showing off your pistol to friends at a halloween party and all of the sudden you accidentally squeeze off a round and shoot your own daughter 
there are two possible scenarios that would take place the first one being that a swat team responds and you are killed the second less lethal result would be your inevitable arrest and charges of public endangerment unlawful discharge illegal use of a firearm assault with a deadly weapon terrorism or a myriad of other charges associated with sending a deadly projectile hurling through a wall and into a child you would immediately be facing fines jail time probation and firearms restrictions 
however if you are a government agent whos trusted with carrying a deadly weapon into places others cannot you neednt worry about any of those repercussions matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist on twitter and now on steemit share",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,85.75523622326341,51,9,4321,729,4.893004115226337,729.0,-0.3350783918572136,-0.2020278943791856,0.3551087448807202,0.364884444529567,-0.193549207600303,0.3850127188322121,0.0082304526748971,0.0,0.0013717421124828,0,4,0.0,0.0180915027026119,-0.9954,0.059,0.136,0.805,Negative,Very Strong
Admin,jury finds all oregon standoff defendants not guilty of federal conspiracy gun charges,"indian country  by theresa braine 
more details are emerging about yesterdays police action on highway  about three miles from the cannonball river commencing shortly before noon a large contingent of heavily armed officers worked to clear a route for dakota access oil pipeline dapl trenches in a relentless push that resulted in numerous instances of violent confrontations culminating in the seizure of the newly established treaty camp and removal of a number of tents tipis and sweat lodges 
the morton county sheriffs department said that  people had been arrested and that at least one bullet had been fired from the frontlines 
officers met violence and resistance including a protester who fired a gun at officers in the police line protesters who threw molotov cocktails at them and set vehicles and debris on fire the sheriffs office said in a post on facebook  
an ap news story cites state spokesperson cecily wong describing a woman who drew a  caliber pistol and firing three times at officers an account disputed by activists and not recorded on any of the onthescene video or live feeds currently circulating 
however tribal law enforcement apprehended a heavilyarmed man crouched in a creek with apparent connections to a private security firm hired by dapls builders the standing rock sioux tribe posted a description of the incident on its facebook page  a man was apprehended carrying an assault rifle with papers indicating he was employed by a private security firm according to the standing rock sioux tribe 
as reported via video evidence from the front lines on  a man bearing an assault rifle broke thru a barricade and was speeding toward the oceti sakowin camp he was run off the road  mile north from the camp the man exited the vehicle where he appeared to be disguised as a water protector he than fired several shots from his assault rifle tribal law enforcement responded the man was then apprehended insurance documents from the vehicle reveal that it is owned by dakota access pipeline we commend the bia law enforcement to their commitment of public safety and for their quick response and apprehension of the suspect who was clearly meaning to do harm 
a statement by the camp of the sacred stones one of three prayer camps set up near the standing rock sioux reservation catalogued exactly how the unarmed protectors were met by lots of firepower over  police officers in riot gear  atvs  armored vehicles  helicopters and numerous militarygrade humvees showed up north of the newly formed frontline camp just east of highway  the  treaty camp was set up this past sunday directly in the path of the pipeline on land recently purchased by dapl today this camp a reclamation of unceded lakota territory affirmed as part of the standing rock reservation in the ft laramie treaty of  was violently cleared both blockades established this past weekend to enable that occupation were also cleared 
at least one sniper atop a humvee scanned the crowd of protectors people and horses were shot at with beanbag guns noise concussion devices were used and fireextinguishersized canisters of tear gas and mace were deployed police used pepper spray and mace liberally photo savannah joefacebook 
standing rock sioux chairman david archambault ii blasted the use of force the continued construction and the numerous violations of civil and human rights 
we have repeatedly seen a disproportionate response from law enforcement to water protectors nonviolent exercise of their constitutional rights he said in a statement today we have witnessed people praying in peace yet attacked with pepper spray rubber bullets sound and concussion cannons we urge state and federal government agencies to give this tense situation their immediate and close attention 
he noted that dapl parent company energy transfer partners had completely ignored the request by the administration of president barack obama to voluntarily halt construction while the legal issues raised by the tribe were resolved 
by deploying law enforcement to support dapl construction the state of north dakota is collaborating with energy transfer partners and escalating tensions archambault said we need our state and federal governments to bring justice and peace to our lands not the force of armored vehicles 
archambault urged everyone who supports standing rocks efforts to divert or halt the pipeline to remain peaceful and prayerful and not resort to violence or lash out in anger 
any act of violence hurts our cause and is not welcome here he said we invite all supporters to join us in prayer that ultimately the right decisionthe moral decisionis made to protect our people our sacred places our land and our resources we wont step down from this fight as peoples of this earth we all need water this is about our water our rights and our dignity as human beings 
firsthand accounts bore stark witness to the events as they happened via facebook live feeds social media posts and other dispatches from the front lines 
dallas goldtooth organizer of the keep it in the ground movement with the indigenous environmental network posted updates throughout the day 
president obama had asked that work stop within  miles of river yet national guard were used to clear the way for yesterdays police sweep  dapl construction he wrote dapl security forces were part of the invasion they had armed men with ar and had malicious intent to sneak into the camp 
he said that men and women had been pulled out of a sweat lodge ceremony at gunpoint 
the similarities to wounded knee cannot be ignored there was potential last night to turn a peaceful protest into a major tragedy he wrote 
goldtooth also contrasted such treatment of unarmed water protectors with the acquittal on the same day of the armed militia who took over malheur wildlife refuge 
the racial undertones of yesterdays actions cannot be ignored goldtooth wrote armed white men stand off against police in oregon acquitted unarmed water protectors in north dakota concussion grenades rubber bullets and batons 
he said that north dakota polices characterization of them as armed vigilantes was patently false jesus wagner was shot in the face with a rubber bullet photo facebook 
the only weapons on site yesterday were in the hands of militarized police he wrote assault rifles snipers concussion grenades batons etc 
the harm was not limited to humans riders on horseback were also assaulted and one horse was killed 
horseback riders were attacked by police on atvs resulting in one horse being hurt so severely that it had to be put down goldtooth said there were national guard humvees on site with snipers stationed on top 
not even medical personnel were immune 
they sprayed me with my hands up and my back to them with all my medic markings clearly showing they sprayed me head to toe said one man in a facebook post by the standing rock medic  healer council they pointed shotguns at me they pointed shotguns at my back while i was treating patients 
jon eagle sr tribal historic preservation officer of the standing rock sioux tribe spoke of the heartbreak 
my heart hurts he said on facebook because of the actions of a few many people were hurt today people were shot with rubber bullets and beanbags they used pepper spray percussion grenades and sound cannons numerous arrests i cant believe what i witnessed today and its still going on prayers for the protectors tonight 
there were uplifting moments as well as the conflict escalated a woman yelled at everyone to look at the buffalo 
we all turned to the east to see a herd of buffalo come charging eagle said behind them were young warriors on horse back police in atvs charged after them there were shots fired the young men rode through the line of atvs and made their get away a war cry went up from the crowd im proud to say we are still the greatest light cavalry in the world 
many activists and protectors used social media to describe feelings of nausea lightheadedness and sickness after returning to the camps near standing rock and also this morning as a new uncertain day dawned on the plains

no matter how you feel about zoos this story will make you feel good 
zoo administrators are always experimenting with ways to make their animals caged experiences as accommodating to their needs as possible with varying degrees of success but thanks to an innovative and humane new initiative one of our most beloved institutions is setting a new standard for animal rights the san diego zoo has taped telescopes to all of their animals heads so that they can look at the planets 
what a tremendous step forward 
for decades the san diego zoo led the way in terms of tourist attractions but this latest move proves that they are even more committed to treating their animals with dignity with a telescope affixed to each animals head these incredible creatures can now gaze at the planets just by looking up visitors can take great comfort knowing that the ostriches chinchillas and all other animals are no longer limited to just looking at trees dirt or clouds as they had been for so many heartbreaking years 
according to president and ceo douglas myers the project directly addresses a basic right of all animals 
when you consider the challenges we face when improving animal captivity strapping a telescope snugly to each animals head is a nobrainer said myers these are beautiful creatures that deserve to look at the planets 
indeed most zoo animals have never had the ability to take in the wonders of our galaxy but in san diego its now a key part of every animals care plan at any moment an otter can swivel his head and take a look at saturn a zebra can glance up from grazing to observe a sea of constellations seemingly close enough to lick and when the park welcomed a new fox last month tourists were able to watch as zoologists strapped a tiny telescope to his head equipped with a polarized filter to protect his sensitive eyes 
wow 
well if you needed another reason to finally visit the san diego zoo youve officially got it hopefully this will encourage zoos everywhere to continue to explore new ways to address the welfare of their animals thankfully they now have an excellent place to start",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,161,28,2124,372,4.688172043010753,372.0,3.02817593588188,3.3680856961926646,-0.2261552130510109,-0.1947775975232092,-0.3956983748622356,-0.1877340022235924,0.0053763440860215,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0107178576946039,0.9969,0.193,0.039,0.768,Positive,Very Strong

this observation isnt mine along the washington posts greg sargent pointed out that there is only an upside and no penalty for doing this  for both republicans and the press this is how gop hypeaheadofthefacts gets rewarded by medias willful perpetuation of smokefire effect zero penalty only upside httpstcovmzltracl 
 greg sargent theplumlinegs october   
even though early polling shows there hasnt been an impact in swing states  and even though the majority of americans have already made up their minds each time her emails are brought up hillary clinton falls in the polls 
a gallup poll showed that emails are the most americans have heard about clinton not that she is the most qualified candidate in modern history or how her policy on paid family leave might impact them  but the emails that she was already cleared on 
even though one result of the comey letter has been to energize clinton supporters  at a time when she was facing a likely win that can create complacency this still isnt an acceptable practice 
republican fbi director james comey finds himself in the hot seat today after sending a letter that has no precedent obviously would impact an election that was then just  days out and is now  days out and actually bore no information well thats inaccurate the letter bore inaccurate smoke and innuendo that has already been cleared but the damage has already been done 
while ron fournier and others suggested that democratic objections to this unprecedented violation of the rules by comey was just more partisan folly the truth is even more disturbing 
by even suggesting that objecting to violating a longstanding rule is partisan we are allowing the press to enable republicans to continue pretending there is no reality 
in reality no matter which side of the aisle you are on its a rule not to comment on ongoing investigations that could impact an election the reasons for this are obvious and the potential ramifications for abuse are terrifying for both parties  for instance its obvious that the fbi is investigating the trump campaign for coordination with russia but we dont headline that because the fbi hasnt commented on that because 
to do so would violate the rule not to interfere with elections 
so its really quite frightening to hear people claim objecting to violating this rule is partisan even as the trump campaign is benefiting from the adherence to said rule if the rule applies to donald trump it should apply to hillary clinton 
asking that this value be applied to both sides is not partisan 
we must stick to reality we must not allow our need to appear objective cause us to fall so far down the rabbit hole that we enable republicans to keep drinking the nofact koolaid 
the press did the republican smoke is a real fire thing all through president obamas terms at one point claiming he was implicated in benghazi emails because a reporter allowed a republican aide to read him said emails  and of course it turned out that the emails didnt say what the aide told the reporter but that was learned much later and as everyone knows a lie travels faster than the truth 
and now american voters in swing states who read papers will think the fbi is investigating clinton 
so comeys letter did damage hillary clinton even if she wins the election the letter damaged her and down ballot democrats 
the media never learns they take republican smoke and innuendo and treat it as fact every time they look like fools to those who know there was no there in the comey letter but the average voter doesnt live for political updates 
the irresponsible damage is done

Infowars Nightly News,clinton camp desperate russia trains for wwiii,"britain should embrace unilateral free trade right now unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal louis rouanet  misesorg   image credits iker merodio  flickr  
if we read the newspapers or listen to the experts britain faces two ways to negotiate its way out of the european union without succumbing to the protectionists sirens 
the first is a deal à la norway not only with full access to the common market but also with full implementation of eu law and a contribution to the eu budget as is the case for every member state the second option would be a trade treaty such as the one negotiated between the eu and canada however a viable third opportunity exists unilateral freetrade 
contrary to what is often assumed unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal which cannot be reached in todays world unilateral free trade is genuine freetrade it is also the most pragmatic and efficient strategy to foster commerce and peace theresa may seems ready to conduct an interventionist industrial and economic policy which oddly resembles french planning as it existed in the s and s but the freemarket policy paradigm is more likely to transform postbrexit britain into a flourishing economy 
unilateral free trade the british tradition 
the tradition of unilateral free trade is tightly linked to the uk with the victory of the liberals in the s britain became strongly committed to unilateral free trade and from  to at least  free trade was politically unassailable trade treaties however were seen as inherently suspicious sir robert peel when announcing the repeal of the corn laws in the house of commons in  brilliantly warned 
i trust the government  will not resume the policy which they and we have found most inconvenient namely the haggling with foreign countries about reciprocal concessions instead of taking that independent course which we believe to be conducive to our own interests  let us trust that our example with the proof of practical benefits we derive from it will at no remote period insure the adoption of the principles on which we have acted  let therefore our commerce be as free as our institutions let us proclaim commerce free and nation after nation will follow our example this repeal of the corn laws was the result of an intense political effort especially by cobden and the anticorn law league who made the case for unilateral free trade cobden in his later years explained 
we came to the conclusion that the less we attempted to persuade foreigners to adopt our trade principles the better for we discovered so much suspicion of the motives of england that it was lending an argument to the protectionists abroad to incite the popular feeling against the freetraders  to take away this pretense we avowed our total indifference whether other nations became freetraders or not but we should abolish protection for our own selves and leave other countries to take whatever course they liked best some will argue that the uk soon departed from unilateral free trade with the cobdenchevalier treaty of  which cobden himself supported and negotiated it is less known however that this treaty was primarily a way to avoid conflict after orsinis attempt to murder napoléon iii in  the emperor was convinced by this same orsini to support the cause of italian independence this italian question brought england to the edge of war with france being strongly antimilitarists both cobden and chevalier looked at a trade treaty not primarily as a way to adopt free trade but as a way to establish friendship between france and england gladstone himself an ardent unilateralist in retrospect held that there were only two alternatives one of them the french treaty  the other war with france and cobden felt that the treaty was gods own method to produce an entente cordiale 
commercially the treaty was an incredible success mainly because it was not supervised by bureaucrats  as is the case today with trade treaties  but by two prominent free traders as cobden was aware of all the dangers for real free trade contained in the negotiations of trade treaties he proceeded very carefully cobden wrote in a letter to the great british free trader john bright i will undertake that there is not a syllable on our side of the treaty that is inconsistent with the soundest principles of free trade nonetheless bright remained a skeptic and remarked 
governments seem as a rule to be standing conspiracies to rob and bamboozle people and why should that of louis napoleon be an exception the more i see of the rulers of the world the less of wisdom or greatness do i find necessary for the government of mankind to convince cobden of the benefits brought about by a treaty michel chevalier showed that the unilateral reductions of tariffs that bright asked for could constitute the british side of the bargain and could be extended to all other nations thus avoiding a clear violation of british unilateralism 
free trade with or without you 
the unilateral free trade program is very simple the british parliament declares the abolition of all tariffs to avoid a race in nontariff barriers the parliament can pass a law declaring that every product which conforms to the eu norms and regulations can be sold freely in the uk this should not be a problem since the uk still is a member of the eu by parliaments act most of the nontariff barrier problem withers away without any need for regulatory harmonization if the eu legislator considers it necessary to regulate the curvature of vegetables so be it but although eu producers will be free to sell their product in the uk the british legislator may deem it unnecessary to regulate its producers in the same absurd way 
the advantages of this approach are many first the uk can have free trade now instead of waiting through years of negotiations no need to wait for bureaucrats to agree on which laws we burden consumers and producers with 
the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta for example between the eu and canada contrasts the expediency of unilateralism with endless negotiations negotiations about ceta were started in october  and finished in august  but for the treaty to be effective each eu member state still has to ratify it worse in some european federal member states the treaty must be agreed upon by the local federated states this is why wallonia recently vetoed ceta thus threatening the work of a sixyearlong negotiation in the case of the uk  and whether or not trade treaties are actually advancing free trade  the british economy cannot afford to wait that long for free trade 
the second major advantage of unilateralism is the message you send to brussels you are signifying to the eu apparatus that with or without you we will have free trade at this point the eu will have no leverage left with the uk the negotiation of a trade treaty on the other hand is a hopelessly utopian solution not only because of the obvious coordination problem between the  eu member states but also because the eu has a vested interest in making sure brexit fails eurocrats starting from the contestable assumption that the uk has much more to lose than the eu will try to concoct a deal as bad as possible for their fellow anglosaxon neighbors 
free trade first negotiations later 
still it is possible that after having declared free trade unilaterally the eu will decide to restrict the access of british corporations to the single market this is a particularly valid concern in the financial sector were banks and other financial institutions need licenses to operate in the eu member states the concern with unilateral free trade is that by respecting it it will remove any leverage the british government has to negotiate a favorable access to other actual and potential commercial partners without a treaty commercial partners it is thought will soon erect protectionist barriers 
unilateral free trade however does not mean the uk producers will be bullied without their government being able to respond first by declaring unilateral free trade the maintained strength of commercial links made will make it much easier to negotiate with the eu to antagonize a good client would be foolish lets not forget that this past decade british exports to the eu grew much slower than exports to the rest of the world at the same time the uk is a major consumer of eu products and its balance of commerce with the eu was negative by about  billion in  
but how can a country committed to unilateralism make sure other countries will not close their markets let us first remark that maintaining trade barriers to negotiate later with other nations is a selfdefeating strategy sir robert peel whom we mentioned earlier said in  that in the case of wine and brandy he did not reduce the duty because he hoped that they might employ these duties as instruments of negotiation with a view of effecting a reduction in the duties imposed by other countries on the produce of our own country such a strategy was selfdefeating tariffs in view of a negotiation by reducing the capacity of foreigners to produce for the british market were destroying the very interests that wanted free trade peel finally admitted in  during a debate in the house of commons i am bound to say that it is our interest to buy cheap whether other countries will buy cheap or no 
there certainly is a more efficient policy than maintaining trade barriers or threatening to raise some in order to force trade partners to keep their markets open indeed the british government can make it clear that if the eu unfairly penalizes british interests in some sectors eg finance then the british government will work to maintain the competitiveness of the industry in question by aggressively lowering their taxes imagine that the eu wants to damage britains car manufacturers then the british government should not be afraid to create a loophole and to lower manufacturers corporate taxes  even to zero in an economy which was never as globalized and competitive as today the uk would have good chances of prevailing over the eu interests 
perhaps the eu will consider making trading conditions with the uk harder but they would have way too much to lose if doing so means creating a fiscally ultraattractive market just next door in the short run unilateralism in trade can achieve what multilateralism cannot a quick and radical liberalization of exchanges in the long run unilateralism can achieve what multilateralism cannot genuine free trade",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,5.755236223263406,46,7,10531,1779,4.893760539629005,1779.0,-0.487953588572627,-0.5778293249656962,1.9980988125894368,2.010949274096556,-0.1928026908979043,2.0695618984081077,0.0011242270938729,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0017481807953133,0.9997,0.184,0.078,0.738,Positive,Very Strong

the commander of us forces in afghanistan has promised an investigation into the recent death of more than  afghan civilians including women and children in an airstrike 
general john nicholson said saturday that the airstrike on the village of buz kandahari just outside the northern city of kunduz on thursday would be probed 
three taliban leaders were supposed to be targeted in the raid but the forces met significant enemy fire from multiple locations and called for help from a us aircraft which left  civilians including  children dead 
an initial investigation has determined that efforts near kunduz on november  to defend afghan national defense and security forces likely resulted in civilian casualties nicholson said in a statement we will work with our afghan partners to investigate and determine the facts and we will work with the government of afghanistan to provide assistance 
the targets were highranking elements of the takfiri group that were supposed to be hit in their houses according to afghan defense ministry spokesman dawlat waziri

taliban militants were removed from power following the  usled invasion of afghanistan but they have stepped up their activities in recent months attempting to overrun several provinces

No Author,video underwater handgun takes fishing to the next level of fun  daily wire,"other writers 
swedish democrat party member of parliament anna hagwall has announced her resignation from all party posts and will not stand for reelection in  after a furor following her exposure of the fact that a single family of jews control the swedish media one jewish family helps to brainwash the entire population of sweden this swedish mp has had enough 
the uproar followed her letter to the aftonbladet newspaper in which she said that ethnicity should be a factor in determining media ownership of more than  percentan obvious reference to the jewish bonnier family media group 
the bonnier group owns  book publishers  business and trade press newspapers  digital news platforms  film production companies  magazines  major newspapers  tv stations and  other media outletsand quite literally dominates the controlled media in sweden 
hagwall had earlier submitted a motion to the swedish parliament which proposed cuts to the state subsidies paid to media in sweden 
although she never mentioned jews by name hagwall said in an explanatory letter to the aftonbladet that it would be a good idea to let bonniers newspapers go under so that no family ethnic group or company could control more than  percent of the media 
an entire  percent of the media is owned and controlled by the same owners hagwell wrote this is not acceptable therefore media ownership should be spread over many independent companies and people in order to change this i suggest press subsidies only for the independent media 
when asked by aftonbladet how the abolition of press subsidies to the countrys local newspapers reduce bonniers power over the media in sweden hagwall answered by email that most small newspapers are directly or indirectly controlled by bonnier and why they have to be subsidized by the swedish taxpayer is a mystery 
let the little bonnier newspapers in the provinces go under because then a void will be created which can be filled by newspapers that care about people and business owners 
she also said that the swedish public service broadcaster sveriges television svt should be switched to pay channels to reduce svts propagation of the politically correct agenda 
the comments provoked a stream of attacks upon hagwall and the swedish democrat leadership also distanced itself from her saying in a statement that the matter will affect her future in the party 
this week hagwall resigned her position as member of the parliamentary committee on taxation and internal group leader of the sweden democrats tax policy group she also will not seek reelection to parliament in  at the request of the party leadership and it is currently unclear if she will continue to sit in parliament for the remainder of the current term",dailywire.com,Real,english,99.09687615386632,47.88118811881188,75,13,2741,447,5.080536912751678,447.0,0.3987225523767704,0.5495749667938356,-0.0629144929582125,-0.0772015382684243,-0.0084727279064946,-0.0674090608253141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.7039,0.052,0.042,0.906,Positive,Strong

No Author,the simpsons react to their trump election prediction and theyre not happy video,"on november    pm  
donald trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign and hes only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the presidentelect 
on monday trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access this meeting was particularly important because trump has previously limited press access and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected 
some reporters in attendance were nbcs deborah turness lester holt and chuck todd abcs james goldston george stephanopoulos david muir and martha raddatz cbs norah odonnell and charlie rose fox news bill shine jack abernethy jay wallace suzanne scott msnbcs phil griffin and cnns jeff zucker and erin burnett it was a good group and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan 
unfortunately instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward what the press got was a baby trump temper tantrum of epic proportions or as one person put it  it was like a fcking firing squad 
trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media according to the new york post  one anonymous source said 
the meeting was a total disaster the tv execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the trump administration but instead they got a trumpstyle dressing down 
this claim was backed up by another person who said 
the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about  or  people including the big news anchors from all the networks 
trump kept saying were in a room of liars the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong he addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest deceitful liars he called out jeff zucker by name and said everyone at cnn was a liar and cnn was network of liars 
this attack left reporters stunned and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic trump barely let them speak while this is certainly shocking this behavior is completely typical of trump he has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings 
americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is twitter twitter twitter 
interestingly enough trump spokeswoman kellyanne conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well she said 
excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days 
disgraceful

Daniel Greenfield,obamas doj issued stand down order on clinton foundation investigation,"david frum hillary is a patriot who will protect the constitution november   daniel greenfield 
if david frum had suggested that hillary clinton used to play for the patriots i would have found his argument a little more credible than claiming that she is a patriot 
but she is a patriot she will uphold the sovereignty and independence of the united states she will defend allies she will execute the laws with reasonable impartiality she may bend some rules for her own and her supporters advantage she will not outright defy legality altogether above all she can govern herself the first indispensable qualification for governing others 
this is under an atlantic piece headlined the conservative case for hillary which also contends why support a candidate who rejects your preferences and offends your opinions dont do it for herdo it for the republic and the constitution 
the trouble with this line of argument is that hillarys own agenda includes a rejection of the first and second amendment its a rather unusual way to support the constitution by destroying it 
then theres the whole hillary is a quarterback for the new england patriots business who has ever accused hillary clinton of being a patriot how was this patriotism manifested in benghazi in iran in russia ill skip over the outright defy legality altogether argument though its certainly sad that this is now considered some sort of high water mark 
but can hillary govern herself is the compulsive liar who cant help shouting i was in new york on  really capable of governing herself 
i am voting to defend americans profoundest shared commitment a commitment to norms and rules that today protect my rights under a president i dont favor and that will tomorrow do the same service for you

Henry Wolff,littleloved by scholars trump also gets little of their cash,"why american surrogates are in demand for chinese families kalee thompson hollywood reporter november   
the first time dianna barindelli carried a baby that wasnt her own was in  we were done having kids but i still wanted to be pregnant says the modesto calif stayathome mom whose own daughters are  and  barindelli signed up with the center for surrogate parenting in encino one of the most exclusive surrogacy agencies in the world in  she matched with a chinese couple unlike many agencies csp first shows parent applications to the surrogates rather than the other way around its little things that youll connect with people over says barindelli who was attracted to pictures of the couples extended travels and their traditional wedding photos 
the embryo transfer took place in late  barindelli emailed the mom weekly sending updates and ultrasound pictures with wechat an app that offers instantaneous translation the intended parents ips planned to be there for the birth but the baby boy arrived two weeks early  hours before they arrived says barindelli i texted and made sure the mom was ok with him staying in my room i cleared everything with her i didnt want her to feel bad that she wasnt there 
barindelli who used her surrogacy fees to set up a college fund for her girls is pregnant again this time with the baby due feb  of a taiwanese couple she may not be done her first chinese couple emailed her recently soon after their sons first birthday they still have frozen embryos and hope that barindelli now  will carry their second child 
commercial surrogacy is banned in most parts of the world as well as in many us states until recently infertile couples singles and gay wouldbe dads had a handful of options to turn to when it came to finding a surrogate among them india thailand nepal and mexico where surrogacy services have cost a quarter of the  to  bill typical in the us but in the past few years those countries have started enforcing laws banning international surrogacy meanwhile chinathe worlds most populous country with a growing wealthy elite and where some doctors believe infertility is more common than in the uslifted its decadeslong onechild policy the result is a soaring chinese demand for us surrogacy services one that is flourishing particularly in california with its culturally friendly enclaves excellent physicians and favorable state laws that regard ips as a babys legal parents even before birth if proper court documents are filed snip 
snip despite csps southern california location  percent of its clients now are foreigners up from  percent a decade ago rival agency growing generations clients have included sarah jessica parker and  rock director todd holland also sees half of its clients coming from overseas as does gifted journeys a boutique agency in pasadena at san diegos expect miracles surrogacy international clients account for  percent of ips and of foreigners participating in this permutation of californias birth tourism the number of chinese ips is growing the fastest making up the most common single foreign nationality for many agencies right now 
snip 
most local agencies have a mix of caucasian latina and africanamerican surrogates i cant think of a time when weve had an asian surrogate says growing generations bergman multiple agency heads say chinese ips tend to strongly prefer a caucasian surrogate people really have this fantasy because of a lot of the marketing that was done in china says gifted journeys wilsonmiller they have this picture of blond surrogates who look like movie stars carrying the baby with their traditional families snip 
the concept of crossrace surrogacy can confound friends family and associates of surrogates and ips alike in august comedian glozell green who is africanamerican and her husband also africanamerican had a baby girl via a surrogate our surrogate is a blueeyed blonde the youtube star told potential ips gathered in a culver city hotel in early october people in her life kept asking if the baby was going to be white 
surrogate selection aside california has the added allure of numerous enclaves where families can be surrounded by chinese speakers and businesses people from china can stay in irvine for example and they have chinese tv on their cable packages throughout california there are places they can go and shop and find stuff in chinese if they go to kansas or oklahoma its total culture shock says expect miracles anderson snip 
of course any baby born via surrogate in the us has birthright citizenship the chinese couples really like that because a lot of them want to come back and forth says molly obrien a fertility lawyer with offices in torrance who frequently travels to china to participate in information sessions for wouldbe parents often sponsored by doctors offices or assistedreproduction agencies maybe they eventually want that child to be able to go to college here unlike the us china forbids dual citizenship and most americanborn chinese babies remain us citizens most chinese couples just keep that american passport its only if you want to use the government services that youve got to be chinese says csps synesiou

Claire Bernish,report exposes inner workings of facebook and how clinton loyalists control your newsfeed,"posted on october   by nathaniel mauka 
congress overwhelmingly voted for the patriot act nearly  years ago and our civil liberties have never been the same since as if this singular bill passed by george w bush wasnt invasive enough allowing big banks to demand our internet data and more  the cybersecurity information sharing act  cisa  makes cyberspying by the shadow government and the financial entities controlling it a forgone conclusion 
as with most shadow government legislation the cybersecurity information sharing act is packed with hidden surveillance allowances cisa was quietly passed to allow government to demand that private companies hand over personal information to them at will it also allows companies to mine data under the auspices of governmentcreated urgency 
the mere fact that this act passed in late  is monumental since it has been before congress in different forms for over a decade  the election seems to have offered the perfect cover as americans and activists were too busy arguing over trump vs hillary 
scott talbott senior vice president of government relations at the electronic transactions association believes the value of sharing our personal data as a means to be alerted of cyber threats outweighs any hazard to our civil liberties talbott states  
the value is that everyone can be alerted to cyber threats and take precautionary countermeasures before they materialize and spread he said before cisa corrective measures could be taken only after the cyber threat had done its damage cisa allows each company to serve as an early warning system to the entire economy 
who exactly would be determining if someone is a threat is the meat of the sandwich though cisa is ripe for abuse just as the patriot act has been 
the patriot act has made it legal for law enforcement to spy on people without probable cause  to enter their homes or even to strip search them before theyve been to court had the opportunity to argue a case or given authorities a motive for this type of interrogation 
the stated purpose of the patriot act was to deter terrorist acts in the united states but what do you do when the terrorists have already taken over your country cisa simply expands the reach of a shadow government which has already been proven to reach beyond the boundaries of constitutional law 
more importantly who specifically is cisa targeting after multiple hackers have infiltrated computer systems at the white house  the state department  the pentagon  and the office of personnel management along with the democratic national committee  and numerous multinational banks run by the cabal is the shadow government simply trying to create a stopgap before their most elusive yet damning information is made public 
cisa certainly will expand the reach of government surveillance on citizens as it has been conducted by the the national security agency nsa before former nsa contractor edward snowden exposed it 
i think this bill was meant to be a surveillance bill from the start said justin harvey cso of fidelis cybersecurity adding that he is dubious that the stated intent of the bill  to use collective intelligence to warn of potential cyber attacks and possibly stop them before they occur  will result 
under the guise of sharing cyber threats cisa allows companies to wholesalecollect information that may not even be a threat  and then pass it along for government bodies to determine if it is indeed a threat if this sounds like circular logic  it is just the beginning of the odd verbiage within the bill its justifications for entering every possible orifice for datagathering are more confounded than an octopus in a straight jacket 
the government can already enter your personal property including your home your body  your cell and your computer  but now they will have a legal inroads to declare you a cyberthreat simply for sending an email  this begs the question  who is the real cyberbully cisa seems to be nothing more than a prevarication covering the acts of an elite few who dont want their secrets exposed

unfortunately the republican presidential nominee reinforces this narrative referring to a rigged system and an indictable opponent his outbursts follow years of domestic political discord where comity is history crazy seems the new normal and a sitting president can be heckled with you lie 
all told the piece reads like a clinton press release but its actually putins powerful playbook hack steal disrupt mislead confuse in the october  sacramento bee  two days after the comey email bombshell the author is markos kounalakis billed as a senior fellow at central european university and visiting fellow at the hoover institution that doesnt quite capture the man and his connections with the clintons which have shown up in wikileaks 
mr kounalakis author line fails to reveal that he is married to eleni tsakopouloskounalakis daughter of realestate tycoon angelo tsakopoulos according to greek usa reporter  angelo is a top political donor to the clintons as well as the democratic party whose donations to former president bill clinton were rewarded with a night in the prestigious lincoln bedroom in  tsakopoulos confirmed that hillary clinton will seek the democratic nomination in the next presidential election 
angelos daughter eleni a protégé of nancy pelosi and barbara boxer  raised more than  million for hillary clinton in   and that money found its reward on january   us secretary of state hillary clinton swore in tsakopouloskounalakis as us ambassador to hungary in that capacity  she condemned wikileaks for releasing secret diplomatic cables but declined comment on the authenticity of the material tsakopouloskounalakis served as ambassador until  but as wikileaks confirms she continued as a key clinton supporter doing her best to beat back a presidential run by joe biden 
in a june   email eleni tsakopoulos kounalakis tells john podesta that a bay area bagman swears biden is running he said he took him on air force two and hes getting emails last july tsakopouloskounalakis emailed clinton confidant jake sullivan that hrc indicated her view that it would be best to avoid grexit and a july   email to sullivan john podesta and huma abedin she supports terms that will allow greece to stay in the eurozone 
on october   tsakopoulos kounalakis emailed podesta that there is a greek american love fest going on with joe biden very boyclub the same day she emailed podesta and huma abedin that we had a david brock dinner with annie karni from politico she asked to use four quotes from me see attached i told her the first two could be with attribution and the second two without 
as the emails to john podesta and humba abedin reveal ambassador eleni kounalakis as she styles herself remains part of hillary clintons inner circle tellingly the mcclatchytribune newspapers that run her husbands columns do not acknowledge the strong clinton connection 
the new york times proclaimed kounalakis a white knight for rescuing washington monthly  where he served as publisher and teamed with editor paul glastris this tandem made the publication a progressive mustread according to clinton strategist james carville kounalakis reported for newsweek in east germany and ran their bureau in prague he also worked in moscow for nbc radio and mutual news 
kounalakis books include hope is a tattered flag voices for the postbush era  with peter laufer and beyond spin the power of strategic corporate journalism with drew banks and kim daus it remains something of a mystery how the leftist kounalakis became a visiting fellow at the hoover institution known for strong conservative writers and scholars such as thomas sowell victor davis hanson and bruce thornton 
only one time as this writer recalls has kounalakis acknowledged in print his wifes strong clinton connections even after the wikileaks revelations and with a presidential election only days away kounalakis did not acknowledge his wifes key role in hrcs inner circle with john podesta and huma abedin his october  sacramento bee piece suggests markos is right at home in those circles 
kounalakis attacks the republican presidential nominee implying that he is crazy and a tool of the evil putin on the other hand the clinton email scandal gets zero attention and the author piles on the ad copy american society has made great strides in lgbtq rights womens rights and minority rights and has a relatively strong and resilient globally innovative economy 
the author gives readers good cause to regard this article as pure clinton campaign propaganda from a camouflaged clinton crony maybe markos will join his wife huma abedin and john podesta in the wikileaks revelations for many observers the issue is not where the leaks came from but whether the revelations are true and authentic if markos kounalakis believes they are bogus maybe he can write about whats in the real ones",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,58,7,5289,847,5.203069657615112,847.0,-0.1210531164556349,-0.5778293249656962,0.611214120974446,0.5498707777570953,0.1124550744075484,0.5743239599655032,0.0035419126328217,0.0,0.0011806375442739,0,2,0.0,0.0079394283305931,0.9577,0.088,0.075,0.838,Positive,Very Strong
Joe from MassPrivateI,news shot detroit airport uses new system to control travelers,"global research  by aljazeera 
ramallah occupied west bank  enas taha a resident of the palestinian village of kafr aldeek in the occupied west bank has become desperate 
since the water crisis started in june the municipality has been able to supply water for only one hour twice a week taha told al jazeera i am checking the weather forecast every day they announced rain three weeks ago but it has not come yet the only thing i can do is to pray to god 
many west bank communities are facing similar problems amid an acute water shortage that has lasted for months in the salfit jenin and hebron governorates some villages have gone as long as  days in a row without running water 
in midjuly residents in the bethlehem area staged a sitin for days to protest against the shortages sparking clashes between palestinian youths and israeli forces 
it is a very stressful situation i have to consider and prioritise every single drop of water i use taha said we have barely enough to drink cook shower and use the bathroom sometimes i dont do the laundry or clean the house for weeks it is hot and dusty this is exhausting enas taha shows her garden which has turned brown due to the severe water shortages since june eloise bollackal jazeera 
some palestinians have joked that the water bill collector comes to their homes more often than water as demand rises the cost of drinking water has skyrocketed with some families spending up to  percent of their meagre incomes to purchase it 
israel implements a policy of water cuts each summer but this year it reached an unprecedented peak in early june israeli water company mekorot informed the palestinian water authority pwa of summertime supply cuts totalling more than  percent  and the cuts while not as dramatic remain in effect today more than a month after the official end of summer 
we are in regular contact with mekorot to find a solution but they constantly give us different excuses such as the increase in demand rising temperature etc deeb abdelghafour the pwas director of the water resources department told al jazeera 
the notion that the region is suffering from water scarcity is a myth he added 
we have been facing shortages for decades and the reason is not natural but manmade  meaning the israeli occupation and israeli control over water resources in the palestinian territories 
israeli officials have stated that water resources are shared equally in israel and the occupied palestinian territories israels coordinator of government activities in the territories a unit in the israeli army noted that israel provides  million cubic metres of water to the palestinians annually even though it is only obliged to provide  million under the oslo accords 
however disparity is evident in the lush gardens parks and swimming pools in illegal israeli settlements the key difference is that palestinian villages in the west bank are not connected to the national water grid relying instead on local underground supplies 
palestinians living in remote areas have been hit the hardest by the ongoing water crisis as access roads are often poor and the additional costs of delivery result in higher prices 
we need special  trucks to drive on the unpaved roads and it can take up to two hours to reach the communities said hafez hureini a resident of attuwani village and leader of the south hebron hills popular committee taha shows her empty beehives last year we had bees so we could produce our own honey but all the bees died due to lack of water there are not enough flowers eloise bollackal jazeera 
over the summer israeli media reported that illegal jewish settlements in the west bank were also suffering from daily disruptions to water supplies prompting the israeli government to establish a new drilling site ariel  which would provide  cubic metres of water per hour 
abdelrahman tamimi director of the palestinian hydrology group for water and environmental resources development said that this was not where water was needed the most 
the wells should be drilled where there is important demand such as north and south of jenin south of hebron or northwest of the jordan valley why in ariel i wonder as a hydrologist there is already a well there they can simply improve its capacity  this measure was definitely not designed to supply palestinian communities tamimi told al jazeera 
in the meantime israel has accused palestinians of tapping into pipes with the israeli water authority asserting that  cubic metres of water is stolen every day by palestinians 
we are aware there is water theft  however we should ask ourselves why are the people stealing water simply because they are thirsty abdelghafour said 
at the same time increased water demands owing to growing israeli and palestinian populations is stretching the limits of existing water infrastructure most of the water network was installed in  when israel occupied the west bank today the diameters of the pipes are inadequate and the system is reaching the end of its life cycle 
even to upgrade infrastructure in area a and b is a headache abdelghafour said they israel impose long and complicated procedures in order to issue permits to import the smallest pieces or equipment 
data released by the israeli water authority shows that a large expansion in agriculture in the settlements has led to an estimated rise of  to  percent in water consumption this year 
the palestinian authority has no solution for the water crisis in my opinion israel has used this summer to put more pressure on us to purchase desalinated water so they can allocate groundwater for the settlements and their future expansion tamimi said 
since  five desalination plants have been built in israel now producing approximately  percent of the countrys water supply 
we dont want to substitute water from desalination plants for our historical rights to all shared water resources abdelghafour said once we have our basic rights based on equitable allocation of resources and international law then we can think of other development options such as desalination or treatment of waste water the original source of this article is al jazeera",fromthetrenchesworldreport.com,Fake,english,17.49798608325944,5.169608718030007,62,10,6169,1028,4.958171206225681,1028.0,0.0012470409166957,-0.0141271790859303,0.8440371901505604,0.833621000758643,-0.1292356797630464,0.864708151873348,0.0048638132295719,0.0,0.0,0,3,0.0,0.0101663937126307,-0.9962,0.06,0.111,0.829,Negative,Very Strong

No Author,syrian forces purge terrorists from town in hama province,"rt october   
around  civilians were killed in eleven airstrikes conducted by the usled coalition in syria which amnesty international investigated for its latest report amnesty says the us must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against islamic state 
amnesty suspects that us central command centcom which directs coalition airstrikes in syria may have carried out unlawful attacks in syria failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings 
we fear the usled coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in syria said lynn maalouf deputy director for research at amnesty internationals beirut regional office 
its high time the us authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in syria independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public 
amnesty investigated evidence including eyewitness accounts reports by human rights organizations and the media photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery related to  suspected coalition attacks in syria the group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as  civilian lives so far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by centcom 
the report published on wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action could be as high as  or more than  since the operation against islamic state is formerly isis isil started in syria in  
one of the strikes investigated by amnesty took place in the early hours of december   the attacks hit two houses in the village of ayn alkhan near alhawl in alhasakah governorate in northern syria killing  civilians including  children and injuring at least  others the report said a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
according to an eyewitness account an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors 
at this point i had a twomonthold baby boy in my arms whom i had rescued the hit caused me to fall and drop him i fell into the hole made by the air strike that was what saved me my mother aunt wife and children  a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed the woman and her son who id rescued were killed everyone but me was killed the survivor said 
the strike is believed to have targeted is fighters but local kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area 
amnesty said centcoms failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in syria as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in afghanistan and iraq poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of mosul iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from is the usled coalition is providing air support for the offensive 
given the likely increase in air strikes by the usled coalition as part of the iraqi offensive to recapture mosul it is even more pressing that centcom be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians and it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure said maalouf 
a similar operation to capture manbij syria which is far smaller than mosul killed more than  civilians amnesty estimated 
last week amnesty international blasted russia for civilian deaths in aleppo the syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups including the alqaeda offshoot alnusra front russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city derailing several attempts by russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city this article was posted wednesday october   at  am share this article",presstv.ir,Real,english,99.2,47.88118811881188,57,9,3970,655,5.013740458015267,655.0,-0.1516281557987176,-0.2020278943791856,0.2622440888797927,0.2488760660648458,-0.074394277959473,0.2662921099859109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.9964,0.038,0.14,0.822,Negative,Very Strong

october  

conspiracy theories have swirled in recent days as to why fbi director james comey reopened hillarys email investigation after just closing it back in july concluding that although hillary had demonstrated gross negligence in her establishment of a private email server that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against her democrats after lavishing comey with praise for months on concluding his investigation in an impartial way have since lashed out at him for seeking to influence the  election cycle with hillary herself describing his recent actions as deeply troubling republicans on the other hand have praised comeys recent efforts as an attempt to correct a corrupt investigation that seemingly ignored critical evidence while granting numerous immunity agreements to clinton staffers 

according to the daily mail  and a source close to james comey the decision at least in part came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi who felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 
james comeys decision to revive the investigation of hillary clintons email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi  including some of his top deputies according to a source close to the embattled fbi director 

the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week 

some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 

according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice 

he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom 

the people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him the source continued and that includes his wife pat she kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state though were sure there are many facets behind comeys decision making process we can all be quite certain at this point that hes not motivated by a desire to make friends having now alienated just about everyone in washington both in law enforcement and in both political parties in fact after tim kaine just last week praised comey as a wonderful career public servant with the highest standards of integrity
