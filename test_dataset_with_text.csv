Relampago Furioso,ways the media responded with butthurt to donald trumps victory,"with the media gripped by accusatory speculation regarding the identity of the source behind the wikileaks leak of hacked podesta and dnc emails much of it focused on russia a new theory has emerged from craig murray the former british ambassador to uzbekistan who tells sputnik a russian media outlet that the source of the leaks are not russian hackers but a washington insider
the source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with russia at all i discovered what the source was when i attended the sam adams whistleblower award in washington the source of these emails comes from within official circles in washington dc you should look to washington not to moscow 

asked about whether or not wikileaks have ever published information at the behest of moscow murray said that wikileaks has never published any material received from the russian government or from any proxy of the russian government its simply a completely untrue claim designed to divert attention from the content of the material
while blasted by washington first by republicans several years ago and most recently by democrats the wikileaks revelations have often been hailed as a champion of accountability
i think whistleblowers have become extremely important in the west because the propaganda model  as chomsky puts it  has been reinforced to the extent that people dont get any true information out of the media at all its worth saying that julian assange and wikileaks are publishers they publish what whistleblowers leak to them mr murrary told sputnik
yet whistleblowers in the us continue to be subject to lengthy prison sentences a key example is chelsea manning who was sentenced on august   to a thirty five year sentence for providing wikileaks with sensitive military and diplomatic documents highlighting among other things us military conduct in iraq murray also mentions the case of john kiriakou a former investigator of international terrorism with the cia who turned whistleblower
the people who did the torture have suffered no comeback at all adds mr murray
taking a step back and discussing the risk of geopolitical escalation between russia and the us murray told sputnik that there is no chance whatsoever that russia is going to ever attack the united states that simply isnt going to happen
just as russia is not going to attack the united kingdom there never has been a chance that russia would ever attack either of these two countries but of course the narrative is all to do with power and funneling huge amounts of american taxpayer money into the defense industry and the security industry and these people are both from the class that benefits
its an extremely dangerous game says mr murray and it feeds into a foreign policy that is completely mad
in syria  and i should say im no fan of the assad regime at all  but the idea that backing assorted groups of jihadists to tear the country apart is a better solution is crazy and its especially crazy when weve already messed up iraq afghanistan and now were doing exactly the same thing again and you can see it doesnt work it only works in terms of promoting continued instability and continued spending for the military and the security services
finally murray also believes that the public cant get clear analysis of these issues from mainstream media because they are part of the same moneypower nexus

Alex Ansary,russias most potent weapon hoarding gold,"wikileaks documents reveal united nations interest in ufos  
huffington post 
revelations in a set of hacked emails released by wikileaks earlier this month have sparked new conversations about ufos and speculation that extraterrestrials have been visiting earth but a very significant  and possibly overlooked  group of wikileaks items relevant to the topic was released on may   
wikileaks posted more than half a million us state department diplomatic documents from  detailing americas interactions with countries all around the world  including grenada prime minister eric gairys efforts to organize a united nationsbased committee to research and investigate global ufo reports 
many of the documents written by american un officials indicated how closely they were monitoring grenadas uforelated activities 
one document  from nov   revealed my involvement in helping grenada to produce a credible ufo presentation 
i had an opportunity in early  to meet gairy in new york to present an idea about how i thought the un would pay attention to his ufo crusade through his ambassadors i gave him a copy of a documentary record album ufos the credibility factor that i produced for cbs inc in  
gairy and i met and after i convinced him i could bring a very credible group of speakers to the un he agreed to sponsor my proposal see image below shortly after a handshake deal he made me a temporary delegateadviser of grenada and the rest was well history courtesy of lee speigel this  letter from grenada to lee speigel confirmed that countrys commitment to sponsor speigels ufo presentation at the united nations 
the following image shows part of the group i brought together in july  to meet with un secretarygeneral kurt waldheim he wanted to know what we were planning to do at our november event in front of the special political committee which included representatives from the committee on the peaceful uses of outer space courtesy of lee speigel on july   producer lee speigel now a huffington post writer brought together a group of military scientific and psychological experts to meet with united nations secretarygeneral kurt waldheim to discuss speigels upcoming presentation to the un special political committee later that year topic the importance of establishing an international ufo committee pictured from left usaf astronaut col gordon cooper astronomer jacques vallee astronomerastrophysicist claude poher astronomer j allen hynek grenada prime minister sir eric gairy waldheim morton gleisner of the special political committee lee speigel researcher leonard stringfield and university of colorado psychologist david saunders 
another cable posted on wikileaks  from nov   refers to ambassador richard petrees meeting with grenada representatives to discuss their ufo resolution ambassador petree acknowledged the high level of interest in ufos among some elements of the private sector and scientific community  and pointed to the budgetary impact as a major concern of the us and other countries 
on nov   the day after our presentation at the un this document was sent through official channels detailing the actual ufo event describing what each of the invited scientific and military speakers had to say to the member nations 
a few days after that on dec   a followup cable was transmitted including the following 
subsequent to the introduction of the grenadian ufo resolution misoff mission officer has engaged in two separate informal negotiating sessions which included representation from austria ussr and grenada in an attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem 
a draft decision to be taken by the special political committee spc has been agreed upon by the participants in the informal negotiations subject to concurrence of their respective capitals we think referral of the ufo matter to the outer space committee osc without a preordained mandate as to what action is to be taken provides the flexibility the osc needs to take whatever action it deems appropriate 
it will also obviate the need to vote on a resolution and gamble on the results 
the following week brought forth another document  on dec   which stated 
the general assembly invites interested member states to take appropriate steps to coordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life including unidentified flying objects and to inform the secretarygeneral of the observations research and evaluation of such activities 
it was further suggested that grenadas views on ufos could be discussed in  unfortunately that didnt come to pass as grenada prime minister gairy was overthrown in a  coup 
needless to say without the gairybased initiative on ufos it was quietly relegated to grenadas back burner 
this is the tip of the ufoun iceberg it shows how the subject of ufos wasnt merely officially ridiculed or slapped aside there was and perhaps still is some interest there just waiting to emerge",amtvmedia.com,Fake,english,16.496481406625215,12.22722258602208,40,6,4990,782,5.320971867007673,782.0,-0.671403824631123,-0.7657300402589515,0.5321071917884708,0.4479715264029483,0.2288129923314723,0.4700423440869954,0.0012787723785166,0.0,0.0012787723785166,0,0,0.0,0.0022644022665142,0.998,0.12,0.014,0.867,Positive,Very Strong

orangutans orangutans are among a special group of animals with mating rituals based around the lunar cycle meaning that whenever a full moon is in the sky male orangutans will climb the tallest tree and try to have sex with the moon only settling for a female orangutan once they grow tired of stretching their penises outward so they might touch the moon with it 
armadillos in the armadillos song the male armadillos penis makes an annoying highpitched whirring sound until a female armadillo is so annoyed by it that she silences it by having sex with him 
alligators during mating season male alligators stand upright and walk around on their hind legs and place their arms on their hips and sometimes even ride bikes until a female alligator gets horny from watching them 
beavers the male beaver and female beaver each recite a fun fact about beavers taking a step closer to one another as they do so at some point they get so close that theyre actually mating 
elephants before having sex the female elephant will coat her male partner in sticky boiling hot pepsi that only comes out of her trunk when shes in the mood 
iguanas when it is time for iguanas to mate the male iguana climbs on top of a female fox and the female iguana climbs on top of a male fox the two iguanas ride their foxes straight at each other at full speed and when the foxes collide with each other the iguanas are flung forward and collide in midair as they fly through the air the male iguana impregnates the female iguana who sprays eggs in all directions as she hurtles haphazardly toward the sky when the mating ritual is complete both iguanas hit the ground and die

Jason Easley,trump has gotten the republican party sued for trying to intimidate voters,"by reuters    pm democrat hillary clintons top aides on saturday lashed out at fbi director james comey for igniting a new controversy over a longrunning private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading innuendo   
by roberta rampton and steve holland 
daytona beach flagolden colo reuters  democrat hillary clintons top aides on saturday lashed out at fbi director james comey for igniting a new controversy over a longrunning private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading innuendo 
comey who has headed the federal bureau of investigation since  notified the us congress on friday that the agency is again reviewing emails even though in july it decided not to seek prosecution of clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state 
john podesta who heads clintons presidential campaign told reporters that comeys letter to congress was light on facts heavy on innuendo and he urged comey to come forward and give those answers to the american public about the exact nature of the fbis latest review of emails 
sources close to the investigation on friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into anthony weiner the estranged husband of top clinton aide huma abedin 
weiner a former us congressman from new york is the target of an fbi investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a yearold girl in north carolina 
with the nov  elections quickly approaching republican presidential candidate donald trump pounded away at the new fbi development devoting a large part of a campaign speech in golden colorado to attacking clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency 
her criminal action was willful deliberate intentional and purposeful trump said standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure 
comey however has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the fbi or the nature of their contents 
clintons campaign tried to play down the new review theres no evidence of wrongdoing no charge of wrongdoing podesta said in the fbis latest announcement that it was taking appropriate investigative steps after learning of emails that appear to be pertinent to the earlier probe 
clinton campaign manager robby mook trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign said americans had already factored what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots 
we dont see it changing the landscape for undecided voters mook said 
clinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters 
clinton was campaigning in florida on saturday a battleground state that many analysts say trump must win in order to have any chance of being elected 
in recent weeks trump has been running behind clinton in most public opinion polls 
justice department officials according to a source who asked not to be identified were opposed to the fbi directors letter being sent to congress and believe his actions conflict with a justice department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections 
while attorney general loretta lynch did not discuss the matter directly with comey the source said aides were in touch with each other 
comey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a followup to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the fbis probe of clintons emails the source said 
meanwhile clinton supporters rallied to her defense following fridays fbi disclosure 
the congressional black caucus comprised of about  members of the house of representatives nearly all democrats held a news conference in columbus ohio and urged comey to release more details

oh how the mighty have fallen 
its always an embarrassing moment when a highpowered executive suffers a scandal that forces him or her to resign but it looks like yet another head honcho is about to step into that humiliating spotlight after nearly a decade on the job the ceo of beans has officially stepped down following reports that there cannot be a ceo of beans 
yikes talk about a fall from grace 
patrick buckley was an ambitious leader as the ceo of beans often telling people that he was in charge of every single bean that came out of the dirt and even going so far as to print up business cards with ceo of beans listed right on the front with beans being such a common staple of diets worldwide a man in mr buckleys position may have seemed poised to become one of the most powerful people in the food industry but in the blink of an eye everything the executive had been working for came crashing down before him as reports began to circulate late last week that while bean manufacturers may have ceos its impossible for beans in general to have a ceo of their own 
after a wonderful career at the helm of beans it has become apparent that there is no such thing as my job the scandalized ceo wrote in a brief statement to the press in light of this news that my position and my former role as director of garbanzo do not exist it seems prudent that i step down immediately i am proud of the work i have done for beans during my tenure and i look forward to continuing to prepare and eat beans in the future 
as of this morning the board of directors of beans has accepted mr buckleys resignation and then the members promptly stepped down themselves amidst reports that beans cannot have a board of directors either 
making matters worse the entire corporate structure of beans now finds itself crumbling from the top all the way down as an onslaught of new allegations indicate that beans as a relatively loose category of foods has never been and cannot be a staffable organization

in response to the election of trump leftist city leaders are digging in officials in los angeles chicago and boston signaling that they will not cooperate with the federal governments deportation efforts here are five things you need to know about sanctuary cities 
 sanctuary cities are a blatant violation of federal law some on the left have tried to claim that theyre perfectly legal but this is clearly false as james walsh  former associate general counsel of immigration and naturalization services explains  usc section  deals with those persons who knowingly conceal harbor or shield undocumented aliens and could apply to officials in sanctuary cities and states 
the fact that leftists are digging their heels in on sanctuary cities means theyre supporting a form of nullification an irony not missed by victor davis hanson  
much of the rural west opposes the endangered species act can wyoming declare that federally protected rats and bugs are not protected inside its state borders when such pests obstruct construction of dams or highways many conservatives oppose federal restrictions on gun sales could oklahoma city declare handgun purchases within its citylimits free of federal firearms statutes perhaps little rock could ignore a supreme court ruling and announce that gay marriage is not legal within its jurisdiction on what rationale would liberals in california object to such nullifications  that neither state nor city had the right to ignore a federal law or to obstruct the law enforcement duties of federal officials 
trump and the gop can fight against sanctuary cities by cutting off federal funding and sending in federal agents to mandate the cities to follow the law 
 sanctuary cities undermine law enforcement not only do they refuse to cooperate with federal agents in deporting illegals sanctuary cities make it more difficult for police officers to do their job some police officers in the los angeles police department lapd expressed their frustration with the citys sanctuary city policy to heather mac donald in  
we cant even talk about it says a frustrated lapd captain people are afraid of a backlash from hispanics another lapd commander in a predominantly hispanic ganginfested district sighs i would get a firestorm of criticism if i talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals 
in that  piece mac donald documents how members of the lapd were able to recognize known gang members but couldnt do anything to apprehend them until they had committed a crime  despite the fact that they were illegals who repeatedly snuck back into the country this is the case with other sanctuary cities as well 
 sanctuary cities are akin to roulette the odds suggest that most illegal aliens detained by officials are not career felons and thus supposedly need not be turned over to ice for deportation writes hanson on the chance that some of their  released criminals will go on to commit further crimes in the manner of juan lopezsanchez officials then shrug that the public outcry will be episodic and quickly die down or will at least not pose political problems as great as would come from deporting aliens 
but the odds dont suggest this hanson notes that according to mac donald twothirds of all outstanding felony warrants in the city of los angeles involved illegal aliens  as well as  of outstanding murder warrants 
additionally jessica vaughn of the center for immigration studies found that in a ninemonth timeframe in  sanctuary cities shielded  illegals from deportation  percent of which had significant prior criminal histories and  of them were subsequently rearrested for new crimes according to daniel horowitz at conservative review 
there is no telling how many have committed crimes and were never caught writes horowitz this is just a ninemonth snapshot of the devastation from sanctuary policies as of last year  of them were still at large so much for not being a flight risk 
according to vaughn  from january  to september   sanctuary cities rebuked over  detainers  percent of which involved individuals with a prior criminal history 
based on these statistics it would seem that the odds are against the cities residents who could be harmed by criminal aliens which makes it no surprise that 
 crime has surged in sanctuary cities the daily wire s hank berrien reported on the following from louisiana attorney general jeff landry 
according to louisiana attorney general jeff landry crime has risen in sanctuary cities across the nation 
landry told the house judiciary committees subcommittee on immigration and border security that sanctuary city policies allow illegals to commit crimes then roam free in our communities landrys appearance was prompted by the changed status of new orleans where city police are now banned from asking an individuals immigration status 
using recent statistics from los angeles another sanctuary city landry asserted los angeles saw all crime rise in  violent crime up  percent homicides up  percent shooting victims up  percent rapes up  percent robberies up  percent and aggravated assault up  percent  sanctuary cities encourage further illegal immigration and promote an underground economy that sabotages the tax base 
this would make sense given the aforementioned statistics and the fact that there is a clear link between illegal immigration and crime  
 there are an estimated  sanctuary cities counties and states according to vaughn the full map on such jurisdictions can be seen here  do you live in a sanctuary city",dailywire.com,Real,english,99.09687615386632,93.82490884357614,66,11,5992,957,5.197492163009405,957.0,0.1235471982890264,0.1737735362073249,0.7972080046458193,0.7223156646641131,0.1069506342202472,0.750800540682978,0.0010449320794148,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0025882618723083,-0.9983,0.088,0.159,0.753,Negative,Very Strong
Joseph Klein,why time magazines joe klein is so wrong about hillary clinton,"nbcs baghdad bob there is no fbi investigation of hillary november   daniel greenfield 
remember when hillary clinton was insisting that there was no fbi investigation of her just a security review even when the fbi rejected that claim 
well andrea mitchell nbcs own baghdad bob isnt giving up that claim so easily even while the rest of the clinton clique is screeching against the fbi for investigating hillary like bats from the nether regions of leftwing hell mitchell is sticking to the old spin there is no fbi investigation of hillary  close your eyes and say it three times the fbi is not investigating hillary its not its not 
in a complete state of denial on thursday msnbc host andrea mitchell interrupted live coverage of donald trump speaking at a florida campaign rally to supposedly factcheck the candidate for citing a bombshell report that the fbi was conducting an extensive investigation into hillary clintons email and charitable foundation scandals 
mitchell refused to accept reality just a lot of factchecking to do shes not under criminal investigation in fact its not an investigation its just a review of the emails she did not lie to the fbi according to james comey there was no grounds to prosecute her so there are no lies theres no criminality she fretted i dont know even where to startbut i mean we have to put it in some context 
the context is that defending hillary clinton has become a mental illness 
but as i wrote earlier this week fact checking has become a media term for insisting on the primacy of its alternate reality even when it flies in the face of actual reality there is no fbi investigation of hillary anyone who believes that is probably some sort of rightwinger who listens to what the fbi actually says rather than what nbc says that the fbi says",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,82.22642928926737,62,11,1801,313,4.728434504792332,313.0,0.0012470409166957,0.1737735362073249,-0.3116118623054256,-0.2872707641369734,-0.3559632736496901,-0.2823896227902379,0.0031948881789137,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0079136313476009,-0.9036,0.039,0.093,0.868,Negative,Very Strong

shawn helton st century wire 
antitrump street protests linked to the soros funded organization moveonorg have cascaded across the nation for the third day following the  presidential election result 
mainstream media outlets like cnn and msnbc have given the protests aroundtheclock media coverage drowning out all other news stories including a successful transition meeting between the president elect and president barack obama 
outsider vs insider manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of trump presidency photo illustration wires shawn helton 
the free thought project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated antitrump protests organized in part by by the george soros ngo moveon 
washington dc  billionaire globalist financier george soros moveonorg has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of donald trump  exposing the protests to largely be an organized topdown operation  and not an organic movement of concerned americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media 
wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least  major us cities chicago new york los angeles philadelphia boston washington dc portland ore st paul minn seattle  and several other cities saw protests according to usa today 
in light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of trump a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether its an organic grassroots movement or something much more organized sophisticated and potentially dangerous 
soros affiliated organization moveonorg released the following press release yesterday afternoon 
americans to come together in hundreds peaceful gatherings of solidarity resistance and resolve following election results 
hundreds of americans dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the white house and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny racism islamophobia and xenophobia 
tonight thousands of americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation including outside the white house following the results of tuesdays presidential election 
the gatherings  organized by moveonorg and allies  will affirm a continued rejection of donald trumps bigotry xenophobia islamophobia and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the america we still believe is possible 
within two hours of the calltoaction moveon members had created more than  gatherings nationwide with the number continuing to grow on wednesday afternoon 
soros agitprop empire 
last year during the ongoing european migrant crisis startling claims were levied by hungarian pm victor orban left photo concerning the role played by soros 
pm orban contended that the founder and chair of open society foundations open society institute was entrenched in a  circle of activists that inadvertently become part of this international humansmuggling network 
the stunning declaration by orban recalled the misguided machinations of the occupy movement  aka ows in  as well as the soros funded protests in ferguson missouri in  along with other black lives matter protests this past year  all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants along with paid provocateurs into violent action and social unrest 
back in january moveon publicly endorsed the bernie sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for blm associated groups seen backing sanders its worth mentioning that moveon also supported the obama campaign in  and according to the website sanders was the only other candidate to reach the threshold for an endorsement 
as we said back in march professional political agitator flash mobs had been mobilized at future trump campaign events making it very difficult to run a normal campaign  as activists attempted to take away trumps strength in numbers at his rallies this was confirmed at events in both ohio and at a trump primary campaign event the university of illinois chicago earlier this year where hundreds of blm activists and sanders supporters triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage  shortly after trump started speaking then again at reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort trump away 
in a politico article in early  entitled  major donors consider funding black lives matter  we gained deeper insight into the political funding for blm and the soros linked democratic alliance 
major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression said steve phillips a democracy alliance member and significant contributor to democratic candidates and causes he donated to a st louis nonprofit group called the organization for black struggle that helped organize  black lives matterrelated protests in ferguson missouri over the police killing of a black teenager named michael brown and phillips and his wife democracy alliance board member susan sandler are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement 
it worth noting how soros a long time contributor to hillary clinton donated  million in pac money in  and january of  soros reportedly gave  million to boost clintons campaign  soros also recently funded  million to latino groups looking to stop trumps rise towards a potential gop nomination and beyond 
look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country  as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances 
social engineering political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media ngos and social media image source abc news  
during the last month it was revealed how investigative nonprofit project veritas found evidence that the dnc paid participants to incite violence at trump rallies during the course of the  election 
if those reports are accurate  reports which have gone unchallenged so far  this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also us criminal law 
paid protest social justice warriors incite antitrump violence across the us image source youtube  
usa color revolutions 
both the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare these political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions ultimately a radical globalist and cultural marxist progressive agenda is at play  eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial color upheavals and where possible  weakening a countrys national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the un or imf while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the publics political perspective 
this is how the us and its cia conduct their destablization color revolution campaigns overseas  and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the us 
overseas washington tends to use the same cast of ngo fronts to buildup prous political opposition groups as well as plan and generate civil unrest they include the albert einstein institute aei national endowment for democracy ned international republican institute iri national democratic institute ndi freedom house and later the international center for nonviolent conflict icnc and the us agency for international development usaid the financial and contractor arm of the department of state 
inside the us deep state actors in washington generally work through democratic party affiliated organizations like moveonorg  as well as through labor union organizations like aflcio  and unite here  these along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests 
it still remains to be seen if trumps stated dynamic political vision for america can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world in addition to helping economic woes at home or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism this remains to be seen 
certainly judging by president obama and hillary clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest  one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots the political motivation is undeniable  to help delegitimize a new trump presidency 
but one thing is for sure  theres no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the th president and the public should question why 
legal action against soros groups 
in a recent report featured at rt news we learn that george soros and blm activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in dallas and baton rouge the father of the dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a black lives matter protest is suing the organizations activists and george soros for  million  in a separate suit a baton rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a blm protest 
the father of patrick zamarripa filed a lawsuit against black lives matter and other groups for allegedly inciting a war on police that led to the death of his son 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in dallas on monday seeks  million in damages 
while defendant black lives matter claims to combat antiblack racism the lawsuit said according to the fort worth star telegram the movement has in fact incited and committed further violence severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities jews and caucasians defendant black lives matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang 
the misguided machinations behind the antitrump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the presidentelect will these protest groups be a reboot of the ows movement occupying the masses with their own hateful rhetoric as we move into  and beyond

moveonorg is a george soros ngoand george soros ngos have nothing to do with charity or justice and everything to do with political leverage and in extreme cases government insurrection 
we have seen soros begin destructive movements to remove those he deems unsuitable to govern in a variety of countries most recently in ukraine with the soros sponsored maidan coup 
now it looks like soros may be setting his sights on sabotaging the forthcoming trump presidency 
we do know thanks to wikileaks that george soros was a huge supporter of hillary clinton as hillary clinton was always looking out of george soros best interests 
we are certain trumps victory is a bitter pill for globalist soros to swallow between putin and trump soros may finally be starting to feel his power on the world stage falter

Sarah Jones,women everywhere cringe in horror watching donald trump sexually humiliate a woman for revenge,"as a new poll shows  of early republican florida voters casting their vote for clinton donald trump is getting desperate 
the republican nominee begged clinton voters to change their vote in  states where its not too late to do so trump wrote wednesday morning so now that you can see hillary was a big mistake change your vote to make american great again you can change your vote in six states so now that you see that hillary was a big mistake change your vote to make america great again 
 donald j trump realdonaldtrump november   
tuesday evening trump made the case that due to the fbis announcement about clintons emails voters might have buyers remorse  a lot of things have happened over the last few days this is a message for any democratic voters who have already cast their ballots for hillary clinton and are having a bad case of buyers remorse  in other words you want to change your vote  wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think youve made a mistake 
while its true that people in some states can change their votes its not true that this rule was changed because of hillary clintons emails and yes thats a new right wing thing apparently trump doesnt suggest the law was changed because of clinton but he seems to think people will be rushing to change their mind about clinton because of the nonsurprise october surprise the republican fbi director delivered  which was perceived to have benefited the trump ticket 
days ago snopes debunked the notion that changing early votes is being allowed because of the fbis bizarre announcement that they may or may not have more emails pertaining to clinton 
claim after fbi director jim comey announced that he was reviewing emails potentially linked to hillary clinton several states announced that they were allowing people to change their early votes mixture 
whats true some states allow early voters to change their votes before election day 
whats false no states changed their election laws in order to allow people who voted early for hillary clinton to change their votes 
and to make this even better that false information was based on a fox news report that wasnt selling the false story about clinton but still got some of the information wrong this is why the right cant have nice things the left should be vigilant against allowing itself to become too insular because epistemic closure leads to losing 
trump conveniently ignores his own history of email dumping exhaustive list of lawsuits bragging about sexual assault dissing minorities and a gold star family and national security experts investigating his ties and his campaigns ties to russia 
only a desperate candidate runs on trying to get people to change their votes to him because someone found a clinton aides emails when they dont even know what they say or if they are duplicates yet

Debbie Bickers,no title,"actor jim caviezel portraying jesus in the passion of the christ 
jesus christ of nazareth is not the republican nominee for president in this election cycle 
but if he were democrats would try to destroy him in the same manner theyre attacking the  gop candidate donald trump 
thats according to radio host rush limbaugh who hypothesized what this years race would look like if the son of god were at the top of the republican ticket 
should president trump try to prosecute hillary sign the hottest petition in america now to show your support 
it doesnt matter who the republicans would have nominated they were gonna get the treatment trumps getting it wouldnt have mattered limbaugh said wednesday 
they would go out of their way to find ways to destroy jesus christ if he could be nominated as a republican the democrats would do everything they could include calling him a liar the bible a fake book whatever it took rush limbaugh 
and despite the fact the bible never indicates jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock limbaugh suggested democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of his offspring 
they would scour the historical record looking for children he had fathered anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit jesus thats who they are thats what they would do 
limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that republicans would never escape this kind of media assault based on who we nominate donald trumps rnc acceptance speech photo screenshot from rnc live feed 
i say this because a lot of you never trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like trump no its exactly what you get when you nominate a republican whenever there is any opposition to the democrats this is what they do it doesnt matter theyre gonna do it they did it to romney  
ive made this point til i blue in the face they turned romney who is mildmannered mr gosh cant even get noticed into the biggest walking satan el diablo politics had ever seen at that time and they made it stick so this is why i think trump has so many people supporting him hes fighting back against it when most republicans havent and dont 
as an example of how media treatment of republicans has not changed limbaugh played an excerpt of  electionnight coverage from cbs commentator bill moyers characterized the race before it was known that republican ronald reagan would easily defeat democrat jimmy carter moyers stated 
those of you who might speak spanish who might be black who might be women remember said carter whos been your friend and there under the california sun in san diego at a shopping center ronald reagan was delivering himself of one of those patriotic soliloquies at which hes been a master since his days at eureka college suddenly hecklers in the crowd started shouting and waving their era signs reagan took his cue and snapped back aw shut up 
and thousands of supporters roared their approval those are the people for whom ronald reagan is the apostle of the rollback the knight who promises finally to slay the dragon of liberal government jimmy carter won four years ago as an outsider and if he wins at all tonight it must be as an insider defending the status quo reagan has cast himself as a sheriff who comes riding into town at just in the nick of time shouting enoughs enough 
does it sound like anything has changed in the way these people see the world limbaugh asked not an iota

do the committees that oversee the vast us spying apparatus take intelligence community whistleblowers seriously do they earnestly investigate reports of waste fraud abuse professional negligence or crimes against the constitution reported by employees or contractors working for agencies like the cia or nsa for the last  years the answer has been a resounding no 
my own experience in  is illustrative over a twoyear period working with my wife robin who was a cia detailee to a senate committee at the time we discovered that contrary to the public statements by thenchairman of the joint chiefs colin powell and other senior george h w bush administration officials including cia director john deutch american troops had in fact been exposed to chemical agents during and after the  war with saddam hussein while the senate banking committee under thenchairman don riegle dmich was trying to uncover the truth of this officials at the pentagon and cia were working to bury it

the number of wild animals on earth could fall by more than twothirds in the  years to  according to a new report which places the blame on the destruction of habitats hunting and pollution the forecast could lead to major consequences for humans 
the living planet report  says that animal losses are on track to reach  percent in the  years to  the reports authors also took into consideration a recent trend in animal population decline citing a  percent plummet between  and  
the researchers analyzed the changing presence of  monitored populations of the  vertebrate species  mammals birds fish amphibians and reptiles among them 
according to the paper the biggest cause of the plummeting animal populations is the destruction of wilderness areas by farming and logging pollution was also mentioned as a significant problem vaccineladen mms to be distributed via drone for endangered ferrets httpstcowmduucnxn pictwittercomafxrag 
humanitys misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats pushing irreplaceable species to the brink and threatening the stability of our climate said wwfs director of science mike barrett a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
animals across the planet are expected to be affected however rivers and lakes are the hardesthit areas barrett noted that global warming is exacerbating the pressures 
we are no longer a small world on a big planet we are now a big world on a small planet where we have reached a saturation point the stockholm resilience centers professor johan rockström said in a foreword for the report 
the decline in wildlife along with climate change is part of the proposed notion of anthropocene a term which suggests a new era in which humans have managed to have a significant global impact on earths geology and ecosystems 
the notion  which has yet to be officially approved as a term used to explain geological time  can lead to major consequences 
the richness and diversity of life on earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems as we know them today will collapse wwf directorgeneral marco lambertini said as quoted by the guardian 
in fact the report states that humans could be anything but happy if the forecast comes to fruition noting that the predicted situation could provoke serious competition 
increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources the report states 
there does however appear to be some hope some species are beginning to recover suggesting that conservation efforts could help tackle the crisis 
however barrett noted that in order for such efforts to take place society must largely change how it consumes resources 
youd like to think that was a nobrainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business barrett said 
the report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are he added my hope though is that we dont throw our hands up in despair  there is no time for despair we have to crack on and act i do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the anthropocene but the will has to be there to do it

Mirror.co.uk,austrian schools evacuated over radioactive rock,"the war against payday lending apple uses similar tactics with iphone jonathan lee  misesorg  october   comments image credits flickr khrawlings  
in june of  the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb put forward a proposal to regulate the shortterm loan industry 
the small dollar lending rule seeks to alleviate and solve for the apparent weaknesses of the current rates and shortterm lenders by requiring lenders to assess and verify a borrowers income housing costs and credit and legal obligations 
the intention of the proposal is to protect lowincome families from being caught in an endless cycle where many are forced to take out another loan to make ends meet at first glance it seems that the rule would solve problems in an industry known for its dirtiness except policymakers are thinking with their hearts while sitting in their airconditioned offices away from the facts and any form of interaction with the real world of shortterm loans just the fact that they see the shortterm loan industry as dirty supplies sufficient reason to believe that either these policymakers are ignorantly prejudiced or plainly manipulative 
instead of pointing fingers and name calling at the shortterm lending industry they should be applying simple economics to their proposals to see if they hold water 
in understanding the cfpb proposal for payday and other small loans a paper released by the cfpb and pew charitable trusts the bureau aimed to make several arguments in favor of new legislation 
the first of its arguments is that with payday and vehicle title loan markets lenders and borrowers interests are not aligned because profitability for lenders depends on loans being unaffordable for customers but doesnt this argument stand for any industry that sells a product 
for example are the interests of iphone sellers and buyers aligned in the manner acceptable to the cfpb each additional iphone  is said to cost  to produce and is sold for  dollars that is  times its cost to make to borrow a phrase from the left thats pricegouging to the tune of  percent yet there is no noise from policymakers claiming to call apple a company that cheats its customers 
so why should shortterm lenders be held accountable in any way that is different than apple shouldnt shortterm lenders be able to charge interest rates that makeup for the huge risk they incur in lending money out to lowincome borrowers 
studies show these lenders charge on average  percent or  for every  loaned  a profit margin that is significantly less than the price percentage difference of products in other markets 
the second of the cfpbs arguments is that to solve for balloon payments or the cycle of continued borrowing to pay off loans the cfpb would require that most products become installment loans with smaller manageable payments 
the problem with this statement is that the bureau completely ignores the reason why shortterm loans are so available to borrowers  its because shortterm loan companies can offset risk by requiring borrowers to weigh their own risk against their need to borrow 
simply put the short payment periods are put in place to deter those who definitely should not borrow additionally making the periods longer and the payments smaller defeats the business model making shortterm lenders irrelevant because their models are defined by their expediency 
the third of the cfpbs arguments is that their proposal would solve the problems related to price gouge lending by requiring lenders to evaluate borrowers financial condition by forcing borrowers to submit written statements on income housing expenses all outstanding debt and child support meanwhile the lender is required to obtain a national credit report and then deliver that data to all proposed credit tracking agencies 
remember all of these governmentimposed requirements cost the shortterm lenders money the cost of finding out this data would eliminate any ability that firms have to loan small amounts of cash at current interest rates the result would either lead shortterm loan companies to shut down or further hurt borrowers by requiring that they borrow larger sums of money to qualify for loans 
lastly the cfpb heralds that their redesign is prompted by a study by the pew charitable trusts survey research that the vast majority of borrowers want  most products to become installment loans with smaller manageable payments 
at first glance it seems that borrowers in need are hurting and want to find a way out of a difficult situation although there are those who are caught in the inability to pay back loans because they got caught in bad finance due to the risk of shortterm loans many of those surveyed actually sent in raving reviews in support of shortterm loans 
in fact more than  percent of the  submissions to the bureaus  tell your story  program  where people sent in their experiences regarding shortterm loans  were positive and excessively thankful for these loans 
these responses ranged from there are no other avenues out there that can lend money like this to a simple thank you this study was personally conducted by the cfpb unsatisfied with the results they hid it from the publics view until a freedom of information act request forced them to release it 
this holding back of information demonstrates that the bureau is not truly searching to help the people it says it wants to help rather they have a keen eye for policy symbolism and the flash of fighting for the underdog when in fact they are irreversibly harming them while sticking a knife in their back 
policymakers continue the belief that shortterm loans are as bad as they seem comes either because they did not attend their economics classes in college or they simply want to be perceived as someone who cares but we cannot let policymakers make decisions because their hearts lead them to make uneducated proposals we cannot let legislators sway our hearts because we hear about the extreme situations where people are hurt instead we need to look at the coldhard facts the numbers that the cfpb uses to defend their arguments are manipulative and outright false 
the small dollar lending rule must not be allowed to pass and the proposal must be removed and taken back  it will only hurt the people it claims it will help let americans make decisions for themselves  theyre smarter and more riskaverse than washington insiders give them credit for

David Knight,levers of power flushing the vote down the memory hole,"kurds worried turkey will stab them in the back as they fight isis turkey publicly opposes isis while supporting them behind the scenes image credits kurdish ypg fighters kurdishstruggle  
two months after being purged from the border town of jarablus in northern syria by a turkishled force  and just days after being targeted by turkish airstrikes near albab  syrian kurds now fear a stab in the back from turkeys military as plans for a usled push to clear isis fighters from raqqa are carried out 
it is very important raqqa is liberated a chief political leader of the main syrian kurdish party the pyd told reuters  but one point which is bothering us is that if we go toward raqqa we will be stabbed from the back 
at the end of august turkish forces took part in a usled operation to eject isis from the northern border of syria once inside syria however turkish forces  leading free syrian army fsa rebels  took aim at kurdish fighters in the town of jarablus which sent them scurrying across the euphrates river in retreat 
the issue here is that the us claims to find the kurds useful in the fight against isis the kurds in fact make up a significant portion of one of the primary ussupplied rebel forces in the region as reuters explains  
kurdish militia have played a big role in the past year in the syrian democratic forces sdf a usbacked umbrella group as it has seized large areas of territory from islamic state laying the ground for an assault on raqqa 
however turkeys intervention in syria in august in support of rebel groups fighting under the free syrian army fsa banner has complicated that equation leading to clashes between them and kurdish groups allied to the sdf 
the problem is one of trust turkey believes the kurdish militants are aligned with the kurdish pyd party which the turks believe is allied with kurds within turkey whove been waging a religious insurgency for over three decades 
so regardless of whether the us finds the kurds useful turkey has made it clear it intends to sleep with one eye open for the foreseeable future in fact its taking a much more proactive stance than that 
last thursday in a campaign of airstrikes that were the heaviest against the ypg since turkey launched a military incursion into syria turkey targeted three kurdishcontrolled villages along the northern syrian border the turkish military later confirmed it had carried out  strikes on areas recently taken by the kurdish ypg militia and had killed between  and  combatants 
turkeys major concern is that kurdishcontrolled enclaves will physically unite thereby creating a de facto kurdish ministate along the turkish border as such turkey has warned kurds to keep out of towns like manjib which is just northeast of the heaviest fighting in aleppo 
this tangled web of strained alliances and old feuds will likely only grow more confusing as the usled operation to purge isis from raqqa draws nearer in any case turkish president erdogan seems to have discovered a newfound independence  and the days of him obediently  even if somewhat grudgingly  bending to the us will appear to be fading as well 
from now on we will now wait for problems to come knocking on our door we will not wait until the blade is against our bone and skin we will not wait for terrorist organizations to come and attack us erdogan said from his palace last week let them go wherever until we find and destroy them i am saying this very clearly they will not have a single place to find peace abroad newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,2.2264292892673696,54,10,3618,627,4.7304625199362045,627.0,-0.2433532738279656,-0.0141271790859303,0.1691148612093469,0.2049810039430595,-0.3539618215914556,0.2213707985305536,0.0031897926634768,0.0,0.0015948963317384,0,1,0.0,0.00677468769412,-0.0918,0.107,0.111,0.782,Negative,Weak
Dr. Patrick Slattery,after debate duke says usa becoming banana republic,"david brooks whites are voting their gene pool after being ruined by globalization immigration and feminism november   at  am by dr patrick slattery 
on the pbs news hour on friday david brooks said white people are voting their gene pool wow just wow this is the same david brooks who wrote in his new york times column about a jewish woman who came up to him after a speech and knowing that he was jewish too told him that his speech was a description of how jews had taken over america which he acknowledged in the column was indeed the caseone of my jewish professors once boasted that jews earn like episcopalians but vote like puerto ricans in other words they voted their gene pool of course they eventually bought out the republican party as well which gave their gene pools vote a choice
blacks famously vote their gene pool hispanics are expected to vote their gene pool but when whites and whites alone consider their ethnic interests in voting it is something that brooks and the rest of the zio elite and their goyish lackey find deplorable 
basically less educated or high schooleducated whites are going to trump it doesnt matter what the guy does and collegeeducated going to clinton 
sometimes you get the sense that the campaign barely matters people are just going with their gene pool and whatever it is and that is one of the more depressing aspects of this race for me 
but what brooks said about the reasons for whites besides the collegeindoctrinated whites voting their gene pool was even more interesting 
we had a lot of good things over the years that were really good for america i think globalization has been really good for america i think the influx of immigrants has been really good for america feminism has been really good for america 
but there are a lot of people who used to be up in society because of those three good things are now down a lot of high schooleducated white guys and they have been displaced 
when david brooks was growing up whites make up close to  of the american population so it doesnt really make sense to say that the displacement of the bulk of the american population is good for america 
of course he did specify high schooleducated white guys well were blacks helped by globalization immigration and feminism what did that do for their employment rates crime rates illegitimacy rates etc 
and white women well maybe all they ever wanted in the first place was to have blue hair nose rings tattoos and raise cats instead of babies i guess we never asked them 
and college educated white guys well they used to go to harvard and yale now with affirmative action for blacks and hispanics competition from asians and massive jewish nepotism a white guy is lucky to get into a secondtier state school 
brooks conclusion was even more breath taking 
and shame on us for not paying attention to that and helping them out and therefore as a result what happened was they were alienated they got super cynical because they really were being shafted and so they react in an angry way 
well thats not a shock given the last  or  years of american history and so for us going forward its to not reverse the dynamism of american society and the diversity its to pay attention to the people who are being ruined by it and so this doesnt happen again 
here he admits that whites got shafted that we are being ruined by diversity but the weird thing is that line about so this doesnt happen again what is he concerned that hispanics might be jewed out of the america they inherit from whites 
the rest of his appearance was just a poetic rant against donald trump with any luck on tuesday trump will be elected president and we can make begin the process of making america america again",davidduke.com,Real,english,94.81395100814586,87.55704798984418,51,8,3738,668,4.565868263473054,668.0,-0.3350783918572136,-0.3899286096724409,0.2008634615515444,0.2692559163356752,-0.5164002108545572,0.2871484331616124,0.0029940119760479,0.0,0.0029940119760479,0,0,0.0,0.0053016843485453,0.99,0.113,0.061,0.826,Positive,Very Strong

admin,netflix and pill streaming firm boss reveals the future of tv could be a matrixstyle hallucinatory drug,"in a previous article  i discussed stretchingnamely why stretching is important for the masculine man and several stretches that you should use in your training to maximize your physical fitness and while that advice is still valid i neglected a very important concept in that first article the techniques that detail how to stretch
i am not referring to a specific stretch or some sort of hypothetical stretching mindset but rather a set of techniques that can be utilized for any stretch to increase ones flexibility immediately but before i can discuss those i have to discuss the incorrect way of stretching that many people still use
how not to stretch many people believe that stretching is a literal act of forcing the muscles and connective tissue to stretch avoid this at all costs  first and foremost as i have discussed previously in these pages you should never apply any stretching pressure to the connective tissue they evolved solely to hold fast and keep things in one piece they should never be stretched at all
the muscles are the anatomical feature that stretches as they evolved to do when stretching your body should always be positioned in a way where the connective tissues are stable and the muscles are moving
even when you are positioned properly no part of stretching should involve the athlete forcing his muscles to stretch as that risks muscular tearing which is a nagging injury that never truly goes away this is because the human body has naturally evolved what is referred to as the  antistretch reflex  to prevent muscular tearingstretching the muscles increases in difficulty the farther and deeper the stretch is and your body responds to this stress with pain this is a biological sign telling you that if you go further youll be risking muscle tears and should normally be a heeded warning
however if you want to do advanced stretching such as that nighimpossible benchmark of fitness the splits you will have to find a way to overcome this reflex without hurting yourself and as luck would have it there is

relax into stretching reflexes can be overcome with gradual and repeated practicejust ask your friendly neighborhood hooker about how she overcame her gag reflex similarly your antistretch reflex that keeps your joints actually your muscles stiff and immobile can be overcome with a few techniques
the most basic of these techniques is the one that i have had the best results with as usual the simple but difficult answer is usually the correct one and that is the titular concept of relaxing into a stretchwith thanks to pavel tsatsouline for naming the concept
to use this technique take an easy form of the stretch you want to do using the splits as an example you would do a seated groin stretch engage the stretch just to the point where you feel tension in the target muscle and thensit and wait

yes paradoxically relaxation is the key to increasing your physical fitness in this context you are literally going to sit there and wait for your muscles to stop fighting the stretchin other words youre going to exhaust your reflex until it stops being reflexive
this is not something that happens quicklyfrom my experience it will take  minutes per stretch so it is perfectly acceptable for you to get a book or watch tv while doing this as a side note this is literally the only time where its acceptable to have a visual distraction during exercise in my opinion
as you might expect once your muscles have relaxed and the pain has melted away you can increase the stretch a little bit more and hold it for another  minutes repeat this process until your muscles are in pain and you judge that you cant go any furtherthis is a personal call that you will have to decide for yourself as i cant judge when your muscles are demanding you to stop
this technique can be utilized for any stretch and in many cases will give you the progress that you so desire however there are other methods in the relax into stretch family of exercises that can be utilized as well such as meditationmentally relaxing will lead to muscular relaxation
or you can try forced relaxation where you flex the muscle simultaneously while stretching forcing the muscle to relax

either way you slice it dont just brute force your stretching utilize these techniques for better results

the new world order might seem a bit farfetched for many a handful of powerful people acting as puppet masters for the human race is a thought that might not even cross the minds of many that have seamlessly adapted to the beliefs that were instilled in them from a young age the thought that we are all being controlled and enslaved by the banks with the aid of the government is for conspiracy theorists there is no doubt that there are negative connotations associated with being a conspiracy theorist that belief has been reiterated many times mostly from the mainstream media there are people who see the world for what they are told it is others see whats really going on behind the curtain the stranglehold the global elite have on money and knowledge makes them very powerful they either directly or indirectly control every aspect of our lives 
global megacorporations make up to billions of dollars on an annual basis a select few at the top of the company make absurd amounts of money while the employees making the difference and driving the company forward are barely paid enough money to stay afloat if humans stay busy working  weekly hours for very little income they wont have the time or the resources to realize they have been dealt a bad hand the top  percent doesnt want americans to be any more educated then to have the ability to help operate and patronize their business 
the global elite have a system in place which allows them to grow their global banking empire all of humanity are literally slaves to the economic system money is necessary for our survival in the real world today most people will spend the majority of their time working just to survive in the system if money is the god of our time that makes rothschild his prophet public school programs worldwide are where the global elite first begin to shape our minds they continue the shaping through the media we are taught what they want us to know and nothing more 
the rich continue to get richer by purchasing up many successful smaller businesses when the top  percent owns the majority of banks resources and even our governments it means big problems for the people the rothschilds are worth over  trillion and they are just  of  families that pretty much collectively own the world the rothschilds alone could pay off the us national debt  times over unfortunately they would never do such a thing because they own the majority of the worlds central banks the new world orders agenda is slowly taking small steps toward complete and definitive enslavement through use of the monetary system and ownership of resources

these days it has most certainly become chic for the modern liberal to throw about accusations of racism although this type of racebaiting has been going on for a number of years now it became more noticeable during the  us presidential election when these liberals accuse donald trump of being racist they had better be careful for one specific reason 
a leaked video from  shows that during president obama s first campaign he was also concerned about border security and he even suggested a wall now there is just one dominant question anti trump individuals need to digest 
is obama a racist too because he was talking about some things you could easily accuse trump of lets play a quick game if you didnt know who said this would you think it was donald trump in  or barack obama in  
this mans core goal was to preserve the integrity of our borders to reduce illegal immigration does this sound like trump or obama  
how about this one this man said additional fencing could help get our border under control definitely sounds more like a gop candidate than a democrat one thats for sure 
finally this man also supported additional personnel infrastructure and technology on our border and at ports of entry liberals would love to claim these quotes came from donald j trump  especially considering he is the villain du jour in their lives at the moment 
i hate to steal their thunder but these quotes did indeed come from a young barack obama in  even he understood the need for a controlled border before the special interests in this country got to him 
so it is one thing when leaked videos show hillary clinton believed border security was important it was entirely another when they showed that her husband thought it was important but when liberal idol barack obama says it say it isnt so liberals just cant handle that 
but anyway folks it is all about platforms im sure you have learned by now that donald trump doesnt get the free pass other politicians in this country enjoy first of all he is a conservative so he is already someone every liberal loves to hate 
republicans have been so badly demonized in this country simply for desiring to get it under control luckily people saw through the propaganda and decided that obama s brand was simply not working any longer

donald trumps campaign debuted a dark new attack ad on tuesday looking to further its portrayal of hillary clinton as a corrupt politician and doubling down on allegations that she grew wealthy through paytoplay politicsthe tv spot hits clinton the democratic presidential nominee on controversies related to her familys foundation stating that staggering amounts of cash poured into the clinton foundation from criminals dictators countries that hate america and that hillary cut deals for donors

admin,wikileaks email clinton operative thinks black voters are stupid,"a tenperson federal jury has found that rolling stone journalist sabrina rubin erdely defamed university of virginia dean nicole eramo with actual malice over a fraudulent college rape story rolling stone and its parent company wenner media were also found to have defamed eramo who is seeking  million in damages but to a lesser extent than the writer herself rubin erdelys piece conveyed that eramo was indifferent and even callous towards the accuser jackie coakley  in addition to discouraging her from reporting the crime and so continues coverage of the rape hoax of the decade
the controversy which began with the publication of rubin erdelys story in  centered on a now debunked fraternity gang rape alleged by fabulist coakley  well before this weeks court decision rubin erdely admitted to not bothering to contact the male uva students accused of the act these young men via their phi kappa psi fraternity are suing separately for  million  a surprisingly low figure which makes eramos claim look comparatively astronomical
sabrina rubin erdely far left arrives for court pictured on the right is the deputy managing editor of rolling stone sean woods instrumental in the bogus storys publication and who defended it later
because of coakleys limited financial position and the respect even outed sexual assault frauds are given eramo is legally pursuing only rubin erdely rolling stone  and wenner media for the  million nevertheless eramos attempts to portray herself as a victim are troubling she was after all uvas goto college administrator for handling sexual violence cases a euphemism for the organizer of what are basically kangaroo courts
aside from eramo uva president teresa sullivans actions were appalling giving basic credence to jackies allegations sullivan suspended all greek life activities at the university of virginia as publicity about the accusations grew this only increased the suffering of the falsely maligned fraternity members plus gave ammunition to the rape culture activists who ridiculously represent every young male on campus as a potential sexual abuser of women
the true victims are the falsely accused young men not nicole eramo nicole eramo is a victim of the same system she helps to prop up and defend rape culture
nicole eramo may have been defamed but she was also intricately involved in a uva system that does not afford young men even the most basic procedural rights whilst we should be happy that she did not rush into supporting jackie coakleys lies to the extent of trying to eschew police involvement we are still not dealing with either an admirable or upstanding individual
after extensive research i am yet to find instances of eramo challenging the shameful treatment of college students accused of sexual assault whether in specific instances or more broadly she is neither a defender of these young men nor some kind of principled whistleblower the only positive thing that can be generally said of her is that she is somewhat less prone to typical kneejerk sjw reactions ie she did try to get jackie to talk to the police
again jackie coakley has escaped any punishment stupid does not even begin to describe the man who decided to marry rape hoaxer jackie coakley thanks to chuck johnson and wwwgotnewscom for their work in outing coakley as a fabulist and sociopath
jackie coakley is the sociopathic architect of this whole mess notwithstanding that rubin erdely and others would have gleefully found another poster girl from somewhere else in america the degree of malice and calculation in coakleys actions is the worst i have seen even the very terrible crystal mangum  the black stripper who is now serving a long sentence for homicide not false rape allegations made her bogus accusations of racism and being gang raped much more opportunistically after duke lacrosse players declined her services as a stripper coakleys misdeeds however inhabit a world of their own
because women like jackie coakley obsessed as they are with fantasy worlds and selfvictimization have next to no money to go after in defamation suits they need to be charged and prosecuted for crimes such as public mischief it obviously would be better if they were charged with making a false rape claim yet coakley had enough selfpreserving foresight to avoid talking to the police consequently the system usually gives next to no remedies for discouraging outright lies about rape to boot the washington post may have savaged rubin erdely and rolling stone  but it still refuses to publish jackie coakleys full name despite all the evidence completely disproving the rape accusations
if nicole eramo gets  million the accused male uva students deserve  billion attentionseeker emily renda she used jackie coakleys lies to promote an agenda not seek redress for a victim
determination of damages in the nicole eramo case is yet to take place and the  million claim may just have been posturing by her legal team a high watermark figure designed to secure a smaller but nonetheless very tidy sum at a minimum the accused uva students deserve  times more than whatever eramo gets of course wenner medias coffers are nowhere near that big but the principle remains compared to the mauled reputations of the witchhunted fraternity members eramo suffered a slight pinprick from a broken system she has otherwise staked her career on supporting and expanding
other villains in this saga also need to be held to account chief among them is emily renda  a sociology major at uva who is now completing a law degree at uc berkeley a rape culture extremist she acted as the conduit between coakley and rubin erdely as chuck johnson and got news have already demonstrated rendas own rape survivor story has changed  biased journalists such as anna merlan  formerly of jezebel  additionally promoted the uva hoax and were greatly upset when the gang rape was found not to have taken place so many supporting actors created this mess
lets hope that the heavy legal blows against rubin erdely rolling stone  and obliquely jackie coakleys lies continue with the uva fraternity defamation suit only significant financial and legal hardship not the pangs of conscience will stop sjws and their enablers from attempting to ruin the lives of innocent men

an elite stratum of wealthy and politically dominant people intends to make hillary clinton our next president these are the oligarchs the  whose wealth and incomes continue growing while most american struggle in her private life hillary clinton is wellpositioned among this cohort and they expect her as president to protect their wealth and maintain their dominance she will
to assure the oligarchs success the democratic national committee is brutalizing the presidential electoral process willfully violating rules laws and precedent the strategy succeeded in the primary elections and it will win the general
who are these people the top  of wealthholders numbers about  million predominantly they are citizens whose wealth depends on the huge american domestic and transnational corporations either directlyexecutives directors investors contractors suppliersor indirectly in other ways eg investment bankers hedge fund managers consultants top law firms two preeminent names in this grouping are hillary and bill clinton whose net worth about  million qualifies the couple for the  stratum by a factor of  others are wall street bankersthe clintons primal financial benefactors and firstname friends lloyd blankfein jamie dimon robert rubin brian moynihan michael corbat james gorman timothy geithner john stumpf etc a more accurate description of the  would be the corporate elite 
candidate clintons relationship to her elite compatriots is one of rigid interdependence she needs their financial and political resources to win the election and they need her in the white house to sustain their privileged status
this privileged status did not result from accident random chance or neglect it is a consequence of public policies consciously adopted over the past three or four decades which shift wealth and incomes systematically upward cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy for example while exporting  of the nations manufacturing jobs in the process our democracy was transformed public policy is crafted today not primarily to advance the welfare of the nations people but to create protect or enhance the financial interests of american corporate enterprise this is acknowledged in the statements of public figures and supported in rigorous scholarly research 
more a new email investigation on clinton could hasten the democratic partys demise the banana republic of america democracy be damned to the superdelegates stand tall in statesmanship anointment of hillary clinton exposes a democracy that never was though easily identifiable the corporate elite has not constructed a conscious conspiracy against the american people at large with a preplanned agenda strategy and tactics but they share a common mindset they are networked by personal acquaintance and they are driven by a common imperative their wealth and political dominance depend on the existing configurations of american domestic and foreign policy both of which must be maintained essentially intact to sustain the groups position of privilege alterations in the status quo can be tolerated only if they are cosmetic slight and at the margin
instead of conspiracy the preeminence of the oligarchs is better seen as a malignant condition of contemporary american government resulting from years of institutional decay and corruption  the story of moribund democracy is detailed here  the economic and political power of megacorporationsincreasingly fewer but ever largerhas displaced functional democracy
yes we vote as we always have but voting and democracy are not interchangeable terms the russian people voted for vladimir putin the iraqis voted for saddam hussein and voting isnt a prerequisite for democracy to function the ancient greeks chose their representatives by lottery
the priority of corporate interests has been achieved by three powerful mechanisms
perhaps the least recognized is the degree to which corporate personnel enter government to staff the highest levels of the executive branch
a new book by political scientists bastiaan van apeldoorn and nana de graaff carries a sobering title american grand strategies and corporate elite networks  they looked into the grand strategy makers the  most influential people in cabinetlevel and senior advisory positions in the last three administrationsbill clintons bushs and obamas in the clinton administration  of the  grand strategy makers  were linked to  different transnational or financial corporations as executives directors senior associates or partners in law firms either prior to their public service or after it in the bush administration  of the   had connections to  corporations in the obama administration  of the  over  had such toplevel corporate affiliations with  companies
smoking guns examples of wealthshifting upward to the already rich certainly  the repeal of the glasssteagall act rammed through in the bill clinton administration by treasury secretary robert rubin from citigroup this enabled the subprime loan frenzy enriching the new york banks but destroying  trillion in americans household wealth  halliburtons nobid obscenely profitable contracts in iraq served up by vice president richard cheney during the bush administration billions of taxpayers dollars to the corporation mr cheney once chaired  in the obama administration treasury secretary timothy geithner from wall street administered the troubled asset relief program bailing out his colleagues banks again with billions of taxpayers money
for the last  years the executive branch has been dominated by the corporate elite
two other mechanisms of corporate influence are far more familiar the corporate financing of political campaigns and the ubiquitous enterprise of lobbying
the two practices are related in direct proportion the more you accept in contributions from boeing say the more you feel obligated to yield to their lobbyists wishes
your policymaking independence will decrease then as the costs of campaigning rise and contemporary costs are staggering a representative today must raise on average  million in campaign funding a senator  million a presidential race runs in the hundreds of millions hillary clinton has taken in  million since citizens united corporate campaign funding has no limits and with candidates in need of so many millions the corporate capture of federal governance is undeniable and scarcely surprising
undeniable but easily surmounted we once had a law on the books the uk still does limiting not campaign contributions but campaign expenditures the limits were  for a senate race  for a representative sums easily provided from personal assets and those of family and friends reenacting such a law would break the corporate stranglehold intense lobbying might continue but no senator no representative would feel the courteous urge to accommodate the welfare of the american people could regain priority the impact on the oligarchs however would be apocalyptic
the commitment of the corporate elite to sustain the status quo is apparently absolute by april of  the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign were one indistinguishable juggernaut intent on blitzing the presidential campaign like hitlers wehrmacht stormed through europe the watch words seemed to be first and most they amassed an early warchest of a hundred million dollars or so and lined up  superdelegate endorsementsall before there was a single announced opponent they invited  print and television journalists to meetings in early april to help in framing the hrc message and framing the race  among them were george stephanoplous and  others from abc rachel maddow and  more from msnbc gloria borger and  of her colleagues from cnn and  from the new york times bloomberg politico and cbs each sent along two
the firstandmost strategy worked secretary clinton preempted the candidate space the only others attracted to the race were lackluster lightweights especially the wooly socialist from vermont but senator sanders electrifying rallies made tangible the disgust of the american people with the status quo  sanders proposals were anything but cosmetic slight and at the margin they posed a mortal threat to the corporate elite and its guardian the clinton campaign to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games sanders had to sue to gain access to the dncs voter database the deliberate tilting of the democratic primaries gained momentum
to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games
this may not be the first election in which ethics and law were abandoned but never before has it been so reliably exposed
not by the mainstream media though they either ignored the increasingly evident fraud or were complicit in it from the iowa caucuses onward the press treated clintons superdelegate endorsements as tallied votes this continued even after the distortion and dishonesty of doing so were pointed out based on precisely that deception however the associated press announced clintons presumptive nomination on monday june one day before primaries were held in california montana new jersey north and south dakota and the district of columbia from iowa forward also the washington post and the new york times hammered the sanders campaign without mercy or interruption the story was detailed later by thomas frank in harpers magazine   frank concludes i have never before seen the press take sides like they did this year openly and even gleefully badmouthing candidates who did not meet with their approval 
no the major media failed to expose the fraud but the social media and the internet abounded with skepticism sanders fans questioned the uncounted caucuses in iowa the  reduction of polling places in maricopa county arizona the disqualified sanders delegates at the nevada convention the cheapshot call by the associated press many were certain the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee were joined at the hip but there was scant factual evidence
enter julian assange and the leaked dnc emails now the illegal collusion was documented the sabotaging of the sanders campaign exposed wassermanschultz resigns as dnc chair then the podesta emails and hillarys paid speeches you need both a public position and a private position my dream is a hemispheric open market with open trade and open borders dnc vicechair donna brazile a cnn pundit emails the clinton campaign prior to the debate from time to time i get the questions in advance the attempt to reschedule the illinois primary another tranche of emails arrives braziles complicity with the clinton campaign is broadened she is firedresigns from her cnn post the clinton foundation hosts pay to play the clintons personal enrichment the  million deal with king mohammed vi of morocco
finally the compliant mass media did take note this is after all fine spectacle noted but not pursued no determined effort was undertaken to investigate to document further the deceit and dishonesty and to assess its magnitude
once again that was left to the citizenry the first careful detailed study was published june   by two scholars axel geijel of tilburg university and rodolfo cortes barragan at stanford it is entitled are we witnessing a dishonest election they compared states whos voting systems produced verifying paper trails against states which did not sanders won the papertrail states where tampering with machine tallies could be quickly discovered clinton overpowered in states without paper trails where tampering could never be detected the authors also compared voting machine tallies with exit poll figures and found disturbing discrepancies they concluded these data suggest that election fraud is occurring in the  democratic party presidential primary election this fraud has overwhelmingly benefited secretary clinton at the expense of senator sanders the paper can be found here 
then with the primaries concluded a group of outraged patriots with day jobs organized as election justice usa  published an exhaustive report the study is entitled democracy lost a report on the fatally flawed  democratic primaries  and it is available here  it details in  pages of carefully assembled and compelling evidence examples of election fraud uncovered in four categories voter suppression registration tampering illegal voter purging and fraudulent voting machine tallies in eleven states the group found discrepancies between exit polls and voting machine counts exceeding the statistical margins of error every single discrepancy favored secretary clintonand no such discrepancies occurred in the republican counts the groups conclusion was troubling  elected delegates their report argues persuasively were awarded fraudulently to clinton and denied sanders accordingly
that gave her the edge in delegate count going into the convention in the end however she needed the additional votes of  unelected superdelegates those empowered by the democratic national committee even after a primary season documented as fraudulent then hillary clintons nomination was achieved by fiat not democracy
but the corporate elite will not be denied given the clintondnc expertise and success in tipping the primary elections she will be elected president in the general election guaranteed
the manipulation of the primaries was obscure but not invisible a backlash of outrage might have been anticipated the clintondnc people however are unmatched in hubris and geniuses in the practice of deceit scandals were not even acknowledged defiantly ignored and the language of progressive democracy is omnipresent in the campaigning brilliant deception hillary clinton promises to work for main street not wall street she promises to bring back jobs improve education seek equal pay for women boost the minimum wage expand civil rights provide free college education move toward medicare for all oppose tpp break up the toobigtofail wall street banks fine appealing proposals all but this is the language of sanders revolution and the corporate elite will stand for none of it
but folk wisdom tells us to take campaign promises lightly and the american people are forgiving and trusting hillary clinton is a woman of long experience and we want to believe our democracy is robust
here now we need to be vigilant

Letsbereal,no title,"alain soral is an influential frenchswiss thinker author and filmmaker his beliefs are summarized as french third position basically a third party for those that reject the traditional left and right political views and there have been third position movements in many european countries over the past several decades
major beliefs of sorals ideology include nationalism political sovereignty social conservatism antiglobalism antiimmigration antifeminism antibankster and a noninterventionist antiwar foreign policy a major slogan of third position is reconciliation between the labor left and the values righteconomic policy which values individual work and labor and social policy focused on nationalism and traditionalism
early life 
alain soral was born in  in southeastern france he attended a wellregarded private catholic school before enrolling in the distinguished national school of fine arts in paris founded in  and later transferred to study under the philosopher and economist cornelius castoriadis a famous th century thinker
castoriadis 
castoriadis favored autonomous societies that are selfaware of their autonomy and independence and believed societies should provide legitimacy for their laws and government actions historically this was often done through absolute monarchy by invoking religion and god with the monarch having a direct connection to the almighty what god has commanded is what we must institute with the law
modern capitalist societies proved their legitimacy through circular tautology that is they claimed that capitalism was logical and just and therefore whatever a capitalistic society deemed profitable was therefore logical and just a just autonomous society was always questioning and challenging its laws but at the same time adhering to respecting and upholding the law
castoriadis described modern society as a struggle between creative imaginary and capitalist imaginary
the repetition of empty forms of conformism apathy irresponsibility and cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of rational mastery pseudorational pseudomastery of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption that is to say for nothing and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary the other road should be opened it is not at all laid out it can be opened only through a social and political awakening a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy that is to say of the will to freedom this would require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginary
postuniversity 
soral loved books and knowledge studying radicals from throughout the political spectrum he was a dragueur de rue street pickup artist when the pua movement was virtually unknown he developed a skill at attracting young narcissistic valueless city girls and claimed to bed hundreds of women and published a book on game in  his experiences with these women led him to develop strong antifeminist beliefs
he developed a strong dislike for the french bobosbourgeois bohemians younger wealthy highly educated narcissistic hedonists interested in fashion and trends perhaps something like rich hipsters but less retro more fashionable and trendy
he joined the french communist party motivated by his dislike of the bobos and his camaraderie with the working man the communist party along with the front national were among the few opponents of the creation of the eu soral studied the works of marx and other marxists before leaving to join the far right front national where he was a speechwriter for marie le pen he noted that both communists and front national members were strongly nationalistic and indeed many workers left the communist party to join fn around this time

he became a strong critic of feminism and minority politics gay feminist and islamist or other racial multicultural groups after front national performed poorly in the  elections he formed equality and reconciliation  seeking to consolidate ideas on the left and right who believed in nationalism patriarchy anticommunism antiimmigration and antizionism er is an alternative news site with some tendencies to the american altright pronationalist and critical of modern culture and feminism he describes it as left for the workers and right for morals
he is a boxer and since  has coached boxing he records videos has a regular feature naming the cunt of the month and his works and website are very popular despite harsh attacks against him in the mainstream media
summary of views trolling a feminist
not much is available in english of soral and even english subtitles on his many videos are hard to find i have but a cursory understanding of french so i have relied on secondary sources and translations his major beliefs are
antifeminism views feminism as not prowork as women have always worked but instead as antifamily and antimother discusses two classes of feminists freaks and bitches the real struggle is between rich and poor not man and woman who are naturally attracted to each other he has attacked womens magazines as altering the social conscience and relegating women to the status of objects stresses selfimprovement and virility in men
anticapitalism and anticonsumerism opposed to valueless consumption and consumerism in favor of banksterfree economics and an end to the nanny state opposes desire society and the cult of celebrity
antiimperialism opposed to the globalist empire and american imperialism attempting to spread its cultural ideological economic social views everywhere and to destroy all nationstates
antizionism has attacked jewish lobbying and intervention in french affairs made statements criticizing the jewish people for being ostracized in societies around the world throughout history which earned him an immediate and harsh media blackout he makes a distinction between french jews and zionism saying that zionists are opposing the interests of france and french jews
anticommunitarianism favors nationalism not communitarianism calls communitarianism a poison opposed to ethnic racial sexual islamist or feminist communitarianism which is opposed to morality and national standards opposes the public effeminate homo and transsexual society and laments the lack of strong male role models makes a strong distinction between homosexuality and the gay pride community movement which promotes drag queens parties vulgar parades and hypersexualization
antivulgarity opposes vulgar language dress and speech especially in women has said he prefers publicly wearing the muslim veil to thong underwear would go crazy at a slutwalk critic of profanity and vulgarity proponent of morality and modesty
islam feels the menace of islam is an artificially created and manipulated threat primitive islamic society is not a real threat to modern western states and capitalistic globalist interests manipulate the region to destroy the antiglobalist antifeminist culture of islam to foster animosity between social groups to possibly create a clash of civilizations or world war leading to a full globalist takeover and to loot mideast nations and that the fundamental values of moderate islam are perfectly compatible with french moderate catholic views
antimodern culture and mainstream media opposed to the decline in western values and culture and the sorry state of mainstream media who has labeled him a pariah
le neo masculinité 
many likeminded red pill men are turned off by the leftright politics in america the third position combines right views on nation morality and law with some left positions on social issues and economics i believe if both the left and right hate you you are probably doing something right the ideas here strongly resonate with neomasculinity sorals ideas are stimulating and interesting and definitely deserve further investigation

rep paul ryan could be out of a job after the election as divided house republicans are already plotting to fire their speaker if trumps defeat triggers a big enough loss of house seats 
if democrats pick up  house seats or more speaker ryan is going to have a major problem because his job will be in jeopardy politico reported that ryans enemies in the house freedom caucus are divided over whether or not to support him 
conservative house republicans are plotting with one another and openly pining for ryans ouster because he refuses to change the house rules to all more conservative legislation to be passed the hill is also reporting that conservativehouse republicans are deeply divided on keeping ryan but donald trump could be the wild card that mobilizing an opposition effort to the speaker the businessman has repeatedly criticized ryans leadership and was stung after the speaker said he would not longer defend trump after a  tape emerged in which the gop nominee speaks lewdly about groping and kissing women win or lose on nov  trump could put pressure on house republicans to oppose ryan in a speakership contest 
ryan is certain to be leading a smaller house majority in january the size of trumps defeat on election day will help decide how many seats republicans lose 
eight of the nine house republicans who cast votes against ryan for speaker initially will still be around to vote against him again in january 
those close to ryan say that he would step down as speaker before getting into a protracted fight with his own party but the walls are closing in on speaker ryan

Sarah Jones,comey must explain why he advised obama not to publicly accuse russia of hacking democrats,"foreign policy us secretary of defense ashton carter photo by afp 
us defense secretary ashton carter says the pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust the daesh isil terrorist group from the syrian city of raqqah the terror groups stronghold in the country 
speaking to nbc news on wednesday carter said washington was ready to equip syrian and kurdish fighters to launch the assault in the near future 
it starts in the next few weeks hat has long been our plan and we will be capable of resourcing both groups the pentagon chief noted 
carter who was in iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of mosul from daesh said the raqqah offensive would begin when iraqs second largest city is cleared 
the iraqi army backed by volunteer forces has been engaged in a large military offensive to cleanse mosul of daesh terrorists since last week a coalition of usled countries has been reportedly providing air support to the operation 
its been long a part of our plan that the mosul operation would kick off when it did this was a plan that goes back many months now and that raqqah would follow soon behind carter added iraqi forces gather in the alshura area south of mosul october   photo by afp 
carter acknowledged that us forces wont be directly involved in any of the operations 
more than  american soldiers are currently stationed in iraq tasked with providing training and intelligence to iraqi forces according to us military officials 
the usled coalition has also been carrying out airstrikes against purported daesh positions in syria since  
however the ongoing western efforts in syria have a different nature washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove president bashar alassad from power 
amnesty international a ukbased rights group said wednesday that the usled airstrikes have killed hundreds of civilians across syria 
carters remarks came only a day after british defense secretary michael fallon said uk special forces will soon resume training moderate militants in syria to bolster the fight against daesh 
the new effort would be an extension of a failed  million program by the pentagon that was supposed to train and equip up to  militants every year but was discontinued in november last year after failing to attract enough volunteers

us college students continue to be emotionally traumatized and threatened by donald trumps surprise presidential victory this week sparking a wave of nationally coordinated street protests organized in part through the george soros funded democratic party community organizing web portal moveonorg  
various protests and riots have been organized around a number university campuses including berkeley portland new york city and los angleses 
when asked why she scared by the election result one female university student claimed that the president elect is a rapist while another claim that he trump is about to have a court case about a  years old girl soon and im not down for that 
the alleged court case the student is referring was actually dropped  and has since been exposed as a likely politically motivated hoax according to reports

Matthew Everett,no title,"while democrats perpetually circle the wagons republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad the same holds true for many evangelicals democrats and secularists count on it 
and we never disappoint 
full disclosure i went from a dogged never trumper to a maybe trumper and finally settled as a reluctant trumper i like any godfearing father of daughters was and remain appalled by donald trumps sordid past and his yearold vulgar video in which he objectified women his words are indefensible and i fully expect the clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the republican nominee before election day 
still i will be voting against hillary clinton on nov  in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote for better or worse for the policies and promises of donald trump  and for the vice presidency of gov mike pence 
regrettably with many of my never trump friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith pride is an awful thing we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew  foolishness called faith is just foolishness 
even so there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this trump fiasco first those trumpian cultists who buy the make america great again pablum and deride any person who while not casting judgment upon others makes with all sincerity what they view as the principled decision the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard while i appreciate this milder strain of never trumpers sincerity i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong 
and then there are the selfrighteous plankintheeye never trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltinesssinned against god and compromised their principles brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary clintons tyranny in perpetuity 
the media research center has done america a tremendous service in  the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate stared into the camera with cold callous eyes and then both lied about and defended unequivocally i plead with never trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov  
mrs clintons beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother 
during a partialbirth abortion the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion rather than committing murder 
he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt next he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains thereby collapsing her skull 
her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage 
this is homicide plain and simple hillary clinton supports it donald trump opposes it 
we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch in my estimation mrs clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner 
my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs clinton and ensure that she is stopped she must not be elected president to not vote  or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs clinton still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court 
its simple math and its undeniable the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs clinton by voting for mr trump this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations 
with its  roe v wade decision the us supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder since then the battle lines have been drawn this is war prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers the good guys it really is that simple  that black and white its good versus evil 
history will reflect as much 
under a president hillary clinton millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive under a president donald trump these millions might live and yet even as hillary sharpens her knives we quibble like fools over donalds potty mouth

Staff,david duke on cnn," views share 
dr david duke offers a new paradigm for humanity read and listen to this amazing statement that will create a revolution in the concept of human rights a recognition of the absolute right of every people to preserve its human diversity independence and freedom the right of every people to preserve its culture traditions art forms and characteristics of society 
a path to peace and harmonious nations and societies why we must resist globalist destruction of freedom globalist forms of economic and financial slavery and globalist zionist wars 
in the power of its reason love and understanding this declaration of human diversity and freedom can be the moral engine to saving our european heritage and truly the rights of every people on earth the foundation of human freedom 
i believe that each of us must be committed to the preservation of human diversity i cherish not only the value of every form of life on earth in what we call biodiversity but also respect and honor the diversity of mankind i believe that every people has the right to preserve their expression of humanity its own heritage and culture that every people on earth has the right rule themselves and the right to be free and independent 
human freedom is the principle that all peoples must be free to be different humanity is not one it is many destroying the variety diversity and freedom of a diverse humanity is a destruction of humanity itself 
not recognizing the inborn urge of every people to express their essence in their own forms of art music culture religion societal structure and government leads to human conflict and often to violence and human suffering on a horrific scale 
much of the worlds conflicts are not because peoples and cultures are different but because they are not allowed to be different because globalists and imperialists seek to expand their empires they want to control the resources and economy of all nations and destroy real human diversity human differences in values cultures economies religions and their freedom and independence to preserve and celebrated those differences stand in the way of the globalists who want to regiment mankind and make them soulless consumers human diversity is natural 
human life is expressed in a multitude of diverse peoples created by geographic and social adaption over the course of thousands of years whether we celebrate human diversity as the handiwork of nature or in a religious sense as the creation of god we celebrate the rich tapestry of different peoples and cultures across the earth 
we believe that every people and culture has the right to preserve its unique expression of humanity that every people has the right to maintain and enrich its unique culture to nurture its particular expressions of art music literature philosophies architecture religion diet traditions and values that make every people unique and add beauty and possibility for mankind 
we believe that every people has the right to be politically free and independent and not be ruled over or exploited by any other people or nation and we reject the globalist power that seeks to destroy the independence and freedom of every people and destroy human diversity every people must have the right to self preservation and freedom 
we believe that every free people has the right to live in a harmonious society created in its own image its own nature and spirit 
for example the people of tibet have the human right to live in a society oriented to the heritage culture and tradition of that nation as should all peoples today the tibetan people are threatened by massive nontibetan immigration forced by an imperial power meant to marginalize the heritage and culture of tibetan people in their own homeland the loss of the unique people and culture of tibet is a horrific loss for them and truly a loss for all of humanity what is true for tibet and the tibetan people is true for every people on earth we believe that the people of tibet and every nation have the right to defend their borders and an inherent human right to preserve its unique ethnic and cultural character and its freedom and independence 
nations more similar in their cultural ethnic religious and social traditions are tend to be far more harmonious that those wracked with internal cultural ethnic or religious divisions 
we also affirm that states with significant ethnic and cultural minorities tend to be more happy peaceful and cooperative when each group has the freedom to an autonomy that makes each group feel more at home in society 
if one looks honestly at the world he quickly recognizes that the greatest source of civil conflict hatreds wars genocide and other horrific human rights violations comes from ethnic conflict often accompanied by religious conflict and when that happens it is like putting a fuse into dynamite 
it is a truism that if you want to reduce ethnic conflict you must endeavor to give every people the human right to live and to create society and community in its own values and that every group respect the right of every other group to do this 
we believe that these endemic conflicts are rooted in supranational states and globalist denial of the reality of human diversity and denial of the natural human desire of people to live in a society reflecting their own heritage traditions culture and values one size does not fit all 
instead of recognizing this reality the globalists and empire builders seek to destroy the distinctions of humanity so they will become more compliant to their control and exploitation instead of accepting the reality of human nature and truly the diversity of all life including human life the globalists continue to promote destructive policies that destroy the harmony of traditional societies and historical character of nations massive immigration of diverse peoples into another peoples living space produces conflict not harmony 
we believe that massive forced immigration of nonindigenous people into other peoples lands is almost always against the will of the indigenous people 
and this leads to civil repression conflict hatreds violence one does not have to look much further than the palestinian nakba or the massive immigration into tibet as examples of this universal truth but this reality is just as true in europe and other areas of the world that have undergone massive immigration into it regions and nation states 
look at the riots and deep social unrest and conflict that have befallen traditional harmonious societies that have experienced massive unwanted immigration 
a world of independent cultures is true diversity and freedom 
a multicultural state does not contribute to human diversity it does not contribute to human happiness peace and harmony it more often than not lessens human love and human rights no matter what the high motive it produces more disharmony than harmony more discord than accord 
just as in the natural world every life form needs its own living space and needs the preservation of its own ecosystem to survive and flourish so it is true for every people of humanity 
every people needs a living space and ecocultural system in which it can thrive ignoring this reality leads to conflict diverse human peoples and cultures and religions competing in a limited living space is the greatest single cause of civil war and crimes against humanity 
united nations studies show ethnic cultural and religious conflicts within nations are the primary engines of civil conflict and war which takes an enormous toll in human suffering numbering hundreds of millions of dead injured and dispossessed human beings 
this urge to diversity has always been in mankind and always will be not to recognize this elemental part of mankinds nature is the progenitor of conflict 
in fact with the rise of the idea that people have the right to be free ethnic conflict is increasing as the imperial states created by conquest can no longer repress the desire of diverse people for their freedom and ethnic expression 
nations whose rulers have established immigration policies ignoring human differences are increasingly divided and conflicted trying to change the natural urge toward freedom is like screaming against the tide 
the global elite in government and media which has a huge stake in trying to regiment the worlds populations tell us we are all the same and they endeavor to destroy every unique culture and human expression  
they attempt to change human nature but history and an increasingly conflicted world show that this is like screaming against the tide 
better to recognize human nature and within that context support national and regional freedom that lessons conflict and supports mutual respect 
it is time to teach the new ethic that recognizes the human right of every people to exist and thrive however those who seek their own peoples freedom must understand that these rights must be afforded to every people and any effort toward this worthy goal must be in the spirit of not destroying the rights of others and to peaceful resolution of the conflicts 
it is far better to recognize these realities and inherent desires of humanity and avoid as much human conflict as possible than to try to destroy human distinctions in pursuit of imperialist empire or globalist regimentation and conformity even if the destruction of peoples is based on a utopian vision because it goes against basic human nature it ultimately leads not to a dreamed of peace and love between people but to conflict and hate attempts to control exploit or harm any people is a crime against humanity 
we must condemn violence and the harming or destruction of any people we must adopt a clear human ethic that attempts to control or exploit any other nation or people is a crime against humanity 
we support human freedom and we support human diversity and we support the right of every people to have their own nation or society but we do not support supremacism control or repression of any other people efforts to control or exploit is a crime against humanity 
as a person of european descent i see that much of the repressive globalism damaging the world originates in mostly european peopled nations that are today called the west i see that this globalism not only damages and harms the worlds diversity of peoples but that it harms my own people and i have learned that we must not allow this exploitation of our own heritage and be just as committed to the well being of all of humanity 
this is a lifechanging lesson that i have learned in my own life as a very young man i joined a nonviolent klan organization in my community like so many young people across the world i longed to identify with my own people to defend the heritage that i love and that i believed was threatened 
but still as a young man i left the organization because i came to realize i have no moral right to speak about human rights for my own people unless i embrace the idea of the same human rights for every people and further that we must be committed to securing human rights not with war not with violence not with human suppression but the power of human ideas and ideals 
i believe that the vast majority of the earths people believe in the principles i set forth here in my own life i further realized that other peoples have the same the desires for their own peoples heritage and rights that i have for mine 
i realize fully that only in a context of genuine commitment to respect the rights and freedoms of all humanity can one morally campaign for your own peoples fundamental rights defending the diversity of humanity is a defense of humanity itself 
there is nothing wrong with a people defending their own rights and heritage in fact defending and preserving the diversity of humanity is defense of humanity itself 
but it must come with a genuine concern for the rights and heritage of all 
in that context and only with that understanding can we move toward peaceful resolutions of social religious and ethnic conflicts and at the same time preserve our own heritage and the diversity and freedom of humanity 
nations that have an overwhelmingly unifying heritage culture religious and social tradition have the right to preserve their expression of humanity and their societal harmony 
it is a crime to destroy those values in pursuit of socalled multiculturalism and if one wants to see where massive immigration of alien peoples cultures and religions lead just look to what happened in the warravaged now dismembered nation once called yugoslavia look to the cultural and ethnic genocide in tibet look to the tribal and religious conflicts in many nations of the mideast 
group differences run deep even though the muslim quran repeatedly teaches muslim unity still some extremist elements of shiites and sunnis blow up the children of each other in the others holy places of worship nor did the admonitions of jesus christ against violence and for love and reconciliation stop irish catholics and scottishderived protestants from a cascade of violence that has lead to the death of countless innocents 
although we understand the historical motives of mass immigration of one people into another peoples lands we must not continue to repeat those mistakes in the modern world and create more divided and strifetorn communities regions and nations models of self rule and societal harmony 
and just as a majority has the human right to live in a social fabric in harmony with its history and values so minorities must be accorded their human right to have their own communities or regions that reflect their own essence or helped to migrate to a sovereign region of compatriots 
this is human freedom and this is human rights on the most fundamental level those nations with significant minorities of diverse people should strive toward recognizing their desire for freedom and self expression 
autonomy within nations such as the german language speaking south tyrol region of north italy and the italian french and germanspeaking cantons of switzerland offer models of how recognition of differences in language heritage ethnicity and a liberal degree of autonomy can lead to a more peaceful national fabric 
nation states that seek imperial power through the conquering and subjection of other peoples are now coming apart at the seams because of the inherent will to freedom and identity that grow in suppressed people 
even european nations divided by slight differences in history identity genetics and culture seek this freedom the artificially created nation of czechoslovakia was composed of czechs and slovaks held together by  years of intense totalitarian physical suppression propaganda and conditioning 
when the communist tyranny collapsed they used their new freedom to create the independent states of the czech republic and the slovak republic 
they did this with mutual respect and not war and without horrific crimes against humanity 
contrast that to the artificially created state of yugoslavia created in name of empire and then held together under a ruthless authoritarian regime when communism fell people wedded to old ideas of empire tried desperately to hold on to control over vast areas of diverse peoples as a result a long war and brutality and massive crimes against humanity occurred on both sides of the conflict 
how much better if all parties in the conflict had embraced the ethic that all people have a right to self rule and self expression in their own regions take for example two of the many peoples trapped in the old yugoslavia the serbians and the croatians even though serbians may have dominated the government of yugoslavia to effectively control other peoples such a totalitarian state must suppress the natural differences in people and force a regimentation and conformity 
so even the serbian people lost some of their unique identity as well as the other peoples over whom they ruled people now warmly embrace the right of serbians and croatians to be themselves and rule themselves globalism is a continuation of yugoslavian totalitarianism on a global scale 
ironically the serbians and the croatians and indeed all of us face globalist tyrants demanding to control the economy of serbia and croatia their currencies controlled by new york and london rather than by their own people and increasingly they are subject to a media controlled by hollywood and new york rather than the spirit of their own traditional heritage and values 
and in the height of insanity the globalists are eyeing mass immigration into both serbia and croatia of massive numbers of noneuropean immigrants who are far more fundamentally different than serbs and croats a prescription for future human conflict the rights of both majorities and minorities 
there are many harmonious nations on earth that are overwhelmingly of one primary heritage with only minor differences among their inhabitants 
but nations corrupted by the globalist power and media elite and propagandized that humanity is one and not many go against the peoples will and usher in massive immigration of an alien population 
this process is almost always against the democratic will of the nations inhabitants as history repeatedly shows and then as the numbers increase and societal differences and conflicts and discord increase the globalists resort to the old totalitarian tactics of suppressing free speech free association and all kinds of human liberty even to the point of forbidding the public displays of the traditional culture of the vast majority 
a powerful example is how the american government has now made it illegal to display a christian christmas motif on public ground even in an overwhelmingly christian cultural nation america supposedly created by e pluribus unum out of the many one is now dominated by identity and ethnic politics 
the most powerful lobby in american politics by far is for instance the jewish lobby comprised of an ethnic group of two percent of the american people but driven by ethnic and religious supremacism jewish organizations lead the fight in the destruction of christian christmas traditions 
the political landscape of america is dominated by special interest groups to which every politician must now bow except of course the european american majority which must silently watch as its cultural traditions such as christmas are destroyed of course it goes far beyond christmas americans are experiencing increasing identity politics and division such as generated by massive illegal immigration the rights of small nations cannot be sacrificed 
on the international level it must be recognized as a crime against humanity for any imperial state to occupy another peoples lands for exploitation of its labor or resources where autonomy or independent regions are not possible a degree of autonomy is certainly possible where significant groups in an area can have community institutions schools and other structures oriented toward both their needs and their spirit 
it is time to stand for freedom for all peoples it is time to stand up to globalist destruction of biodiversity destruction of human diversity destruction of the earths indigenous cultures artistic expressions lifestyles traditions and independence zionist globalism is actually supremacism 
the globalists seek the destruction of every unique expression of humanity they want to destroy the unique character of your people and every people on the earth 
they seek to destroy the human diversity of the earth so they can more easily rule over all of us and market the same brands of junk movies media and music they want you and all of us to consume the same junk food from a world agribusiness and media that advertises it that not only destroys the planets ecosystems but destroys your health and the health of hundreds of millions of people spawning epidemics of obesity heart disease diabetes and other ills 
they want to control the value of the currency in your pocket and force you and your nation under a corrupt zionistcontrolled global banking system that exploits you and all of us and put whole nations and peoples as slaves in a perpetual debt 
they want to put you and all of us under a soulless globalist government that takes away your freedom and that of every people and every nation 
and these globalists want war perpetual wars and conflicts in their attempts to expand their power over the earth and over all people 
they grow stronger by divide and conquer tactics and they seek to stamp out human diversity and seek to regiment all of humanity to their new world order all while the new york centered globalist media supports israel as a quote jewish state and supports zionist control of the international banks and the globalist media so in reality zionistdriven globalism is actually form of jewish supremacism 
globalism is imperialism on a global level and the greatest threat to human freedom diversity and independence in all of world history yes to freedom yes to diversity and independence 
but my dear friends all over the world in my homeland of america and that of my brethren in europe but among all freedom loving people across the globe millions of us say no to globalism 
we say yes to freedom yes to human diversity and independence 
we say no to globalist wars such as the iraq war the afghanistan war the planned war on iran horrific wars that are part of the zionist globalist agenda 
we say no to the zionist dominated globalist media that spout the lies that fuel these wars 
we say yes to a free internet and the freedom of people create their own media literature music and art forms no longer will we drink the toxic poisons of the globalist elite 
we say no to globalism yes to human freedom yes to human diversity yes to world of peace and prosperity 
we say yes to every peoples striving to preserve their way of life their particular heritage their particular expression of humanity

No Author,fbi director comeys leaked memo explains why hes reopening the clinton email case,"in a stunning turn of events  days before the  presidential election the fbi announced it is reopenning its investigation into hillary clintons email server case by probing newly emerging emails linked to hillary clinton 
new probe the fbi gives hillary clinton a second look photo illustraion wire 
fbi october surprise 
according to reports  in a letter written today fbi director james comey  stated that the fbi has begun a new probe into hillary clinton related emails once again comey offered scant details about the new probe but due to an unrelated case additional classified material may have been mishandled on clintons personal email server 
cnbc reported the latest fbi developments including a passage from comeys letter discussing the new investigation 
in previous congressional testimony i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation fbi had completed its investigation of former secretary clintons personal email server due to recent developments i am writing to supplement my previous testimony comey wrote 
in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he added 
although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony comey concluded 
humas estranged sexting husband 
according to a new report released via the new york times  
the presidential campaign was rocked on friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the nowclosed investigation into hillary clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to anthony d weiner the estranged husband of a top clinton aide  in a letter to congress  the fbi director james b comey said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case which law enforcement officials said was an fbi investigation into illicit text messages from mr weiner to a yearold girl in north carolina mr weiner a former democratic congressman from new york is married to huma abedin the top aide comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting clinton off the hook for mishandling and lying to congress about classified emails coming through her home brew email server while she was secretary of state after previously closing the case comey has done a uturn and is now saying the fbi will review the new emails to for classified information and see whether it was mishandled 
this unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a wikileaks docudump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between clinton foundation donors and former president bill clinton s private financial activities among those included in the memo was a  million dollar business arrangement under bill clinton inc with another  million dollar deal scheduled over nine years 
the following is a tweet from brad jaffy of nbc nightly news containing the new fbi recommendation 
the new investigation into the clinton camp will most certainly spark new paytoplay allegations  as the new fbi revelations also comes days after a project veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners discussed ways to commit largescale voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at donald trump rallies out of creamers  visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky some  times white house visitor records show that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff also over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability caught on film  robert creamer resigns over a massive democratic party controversy image source cnn  creamer a convicted felon  in  creamer plead guilty  million in bank fraud and tax violations was promptly shoved out of the hillary clinton campaigns inner circle following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at trump rallies pay to play virginia governor terry mcauliffe closely allied with the clintons negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the fbi image source new republic  it remains unclear what exactly reopened the new clinton probe but perhaps the fbi had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime clinton associate  virginia gov terry mcauliffe  helped steer  to the election campaign of the wife of an fbi official who went on to lead the probe into hillary clintons use of a private email system according to a report the ny post also reported on the matter this past week 
the political action committee of mcauliffe the clinton loyalist gave  to the state senate campaign of the wife of andrew mccabe who is now deputy director of the fbi according to the wall street journal  
the report states jill mccabe received an additional  from the virginia democratic party which is heavily influenced by mcauliffe 
the money directed by mcauliffe began flowing two months after the fbi investigation into clinton began in july  around that time the candidates husband was promoted from running the washington field office for the fbi to the no  position at the bureau 
in a cnn report from october th a week before the mcauliffe revelations according to notes from interviews conducted during an fbi investigation into clintons email practices undersecretary of state patrick kennedy personally tried to convince fbi officials that the email should be declassified one interviewee described feeling pressured by another fbi official at kennedys request 
the newly reopened fbi investigation into clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above but theres no doubt that due to public backlash the fbi received following the first clinton investigation in addition to concerns over dealings between the fbi and clinton associates  the agency needed to save face 
it remains to be seen how new case will impact the us presidential election

admin,uk economy grows pc in the wake of brexit vote defying recession fears,"during the height of the cold war the cia attempted to develop mind control techniques with the mkultra program as it happens the communists already had a leg up on them well explore how this was done along with some new twists
the criticism and selfcriticism technique in history this is what happens to people who joke about chairman mao ripping off hillarys wardrobe
the technique of  criticism and selfcriticism  kritika i samokritika was developed during the early days of the soviet union  this got results when the early soviet show trials and purges took place the targets would confess to committing treasonthe details stretching credulityand beg for execution the maoists chinese communists used it too typically during  struggle sessions  also forced confessions were required in vietnam for prisoners in reeducation camps 
what happened wasnt much different from a medieval inquisition those targeted would be badgered until they confessed to whatever it was they supposedly did of course physical forms of coercion were also an option these werent actual trials their fates were already decided
the lucky ones were released and got to resume their lives as before after their memorable reminder to toe the party line others faced stiffer penalties than that from loss of party membership and accompanying status all the way up to execution no amount of compliance or abject groveling could save them if it was predetermined that they were going to be purged or killed
after the ordeal survivors were surely scared witless with their egos beaten down they were ready to do as they were told without question its basically a form of brainwashing as for those who were executed after that the purpose of going through the motions was for benefit of the audience it was political theater convincing those present that they were delivering justice to wrongdoers and serving as an example of what could happen to those who step out of line
other than that the criticism and selfcriticism techniquebadgering and forcing a confessionalso was picked up in the usa during the s by certain cults and oddball encounter groups today we might think of these strange and humiliating rituals as a thing of the past but the truth is that theyve merely changed form  as ive noted previously  cultural marxism is a crappy and inherently destructive forexport variety of communism so its no great surprise that it has adapted this technique for its purposes
modern witch hunts this is what happens to people who say that bruce jenner is actually a dude
when people are encouraged to become incensed over even tiny things  this causes a walking on eggshells atmosphere in todays politically correct climate its easy to run afoul of the thought police this might result in a visit to the hr department or a campus speech code investigation however if the thoughtcrime is serious enoughor the target is prominent enoughthen this can ignite a media circus  also someone could end up featured on a mailing list for social justice warriors  besides just trolling and harassment this can result in doxxing release of your personal information or pressure on an employer to fire the thought criminal
we in the western world pride ourselves on the right to free speech that was one of the main goals of liberalism back in the th century when liberalism was still a good thing actually many free countries criminalize politically incorrect speech even in places that dont have legal penalties for speaking your mind it carries the risk of the loss of your livelihood  this effectively makes entire policy arguments forbidden to articulate which naturally is the whole point other goals of course are information control and thus thought control so much for freedom of speech it took a few centuries but liberals now oppose what they once stood for
the following scenario has happened time and again someone points out an inconvenient truth  writes something that offends someone donates to the wrong cause mocks a feminists first world problems  tells an offcolor joke  or even wears the wrong tshirt  then the feeding frenzy begins resulting in torrents of criticism usually the target apologizes profusely but loses his job no matter how abject or groveling his apologies are
its possible to convince a judge and twelve jurors that youre not guilty of something but good luck getting the media or an online sjw mob to calm down and leave you alone the traditional communist session was better in one way that is they quit after breaking the targets will a modern feeding frenzy though can drag on for months even after the target has been begging for forgiveness what goes on the internet can stay there forever including lies about you
if you get caught in a social justice weenie witch hunt  never apologize explain and clarify if you absolutely must this is for the benefit of the uncommitted the sjws will already have made up their small minds about you and wont stop no matter what you do never let them break your frame instead go on the attack you have a right to your own opinion and to express it
if you beg for their forgiveness then you will be allowing them to turn their criticism into your selfcriticism remember that groveling is unlikely to save you apologies are for people who actually did something wrong having a difference of opinion isnt wrong despite some peoples curious notions about freedom of speech
here are some other particulars to remember
you cant reason with them  online mobs dont know you and have been told that youre an evildoer youll probably never know exactly what was said about you who said it and what email list all that was on if you do find out sue for defamation of character however you can be sure that youve already been deemed guilty theyre not interested in the truth sjws have great difficulty comprehending basic logic many of them dont even believe in objective reality  only their feelings are real to them why would the truth matter to these idiots finally social justice weenies are a bunch of losers  their opinion of you matters less than that of a snotty child cursing you out therefore dont let these oxygenwasters mess with your selfesteem societal criticism and selfcriticism wallowing in guilt at its finest
the frankfurt school  a communist think tank that moved to the usa and began subverting the educational system developed critical theory  one of their top classics was eros and civilization by herbert marcuse it contained lots of freudian arguments on how our society was too repressed and we needed to loosen up our morals another was the authoritarian personality by theodor adorno that too contained freudian mumbojumbo smearing right wing politics with accusations of neurosis and homo daddy issues all told they wrote dozens of books along those lines some attacking western civilization directly these vaporings wouldnt have amounted to much if they hadnt become trendy in academia and influenced the s zeitgeist
meanwhile radical feminismthe second wavewas starting up this too had lots of communist influence  another front of cultural marxism this also was all about criticism of our culture this caused friction between the sexes driving a wedge deep into the heart of society the results included the snarky snotty and spoiled attitudes youve surely encountered worse this caused untold misery from high divorce rates and broken homes 
this was one of several movements that became prominent during the s and are still with us today surely you can think of many others the methodology was the sameall angrily made overblown complaints about how bad society has been to them the way they tell it theyre out fighting for their rights the goal of cultural marxism though was all about attacking our morale and softening us up the people involved in those movements were merely tools being used by leaders who were in it for power money and status
the educational system has been dumbed down  history has been rewritten too figures like christopher columbus and the us founding fathers are bad guys now even as early as the s campuses were hellbent in purging dwems their charming term for dead white european males from the literary canon none of this was really about inclusiveness its all about robbing our people of our heritage making us ashamed of our accomplishments and destroying our resolve
the propaganda is everywhere television is full of social and political messages even in shows for children  and piggybacked onto advertisements too sensitivity training courses deliver politically correct indoctrination college campuses are notorious for pushing propaganda this even happens to elementary school kids my first exposure was in second grade some of the indoctrination exercises require audience participation such as forcing them to fill out privilege checklists with the facts cherrypicked  to instill a sense of collective guilt
all this has worked according to plan many are out of touch with their roots and dont understand that they have a heritage worth preserving worse others have been infected by guilt trips sometimes this leads to public spectacles of wallowing in guilt again theres the selfcriticism part
the antidote to this is the truth the fact is every civilization has its good points and its bad points and ours is no exception its rotten hypocrisy for the bullshit merchants in academia and the media to dwell on our faults and overlook those of other parts of the world while selectively ignoring our accomplishments and elevating those of others  the truth is that none of our shortcomings or misdeeds are solely found in western civilization but some of our good characteristics are indeed unique
you can protect your children by home schooling them or sending them to a private school where they wont be indoctrinated you can always get rid of your tv too meanwhile though millions of other students will be putty in the hands of propagandizing professors and teachers and of course the lying media those pushing this from the top down must be called out exposed and removed from power

Lily Dane,former us state dept official us intelligence community has started a countercoup against the clintons,"posted on october   by davidswanson 
picture if you will video footage of vintage early  donald trump buffoonery with the ceo of cbs leslie moonves commenting on major medias choice to give trump vastly more air time than other candidates it may not be good for america but its damn good for cbs 
thats the introduction to a powerful critique of the us media a new film screens in new york and los angeles this week called all governments lie truth deception and the spirit of if stone  
the website allgovernmentsliecom has screening dates  a list of lies  and a list of good journalists who expose lies  the lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film but theres a good deal of overlap  enough to give you a sense of what this project is about 
id have made various changes and additions to the film in particular im tired of all the focus on iraq  this film touches on war lies since then but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence 
still this is a film that should be shown in cities homes and classrooms across the united states it includes and is driven by noam chomskys analysis of how the media system is rigged without those doing the rigging believing theyve done anything at all its a survey of skullduggery by corporate media its an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm and its an introduction to if stone it includes footage of a presentation of the annual izzy award which goes to journalists acting in stones tradition 
one of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the gulf of tonkin nonincident anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie and it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense that is had the north vietnamese really shot back at a us ship off their coast that would not have been any sort of legal much less moral justification for escalating a war id love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the black sea the red sea and every other part of the earth today 
but the gulf of tonkin lies about vietnamese aggression against the us ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the us role of global policeman someone had to make the lies transparent someone had to document that in fact the secretary of socalled defense and the president were lying sadly nobody did that in the first  hours after the congressional committee hearings and that was all it took for congress to hand the president a war 
and it was decades before white house transcripts came out and before the national security agency confessed and additional years before former secretary robert mcnamara did yet those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew and they knew it because of if stone who just weeks after the nonincident published a fourpage edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about tonkin 
stones analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the red sea off yemen and in fact it is to yemen that stone immediately turned on page  in  the united nations including its us ambassador had recently condemned british attacks on yemen that britain defended as retaliatory president dwight eisenhower had also warned the french against retaliatory attacks on tunisia and president lyndon johnson even at the time of tonkin stone notes was warning greece and turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other 
stone who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks the league of nations covenant the kelloggbriand pact and the un charter the latter two are still theoretically in place for the us government 
the united states in vietnam stone goes on to show could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of vietnamese boats and indeed the us ships stone reports were in north vietnamese waters and were there to assist south vietnamese ships that were shelling two north vietnamese islands and in fact those ships had been supplied to south vietnam by the us military and the good old american tax payers 
stone did not have access to closed committee hearings but he hardly needed it he considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war and then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees he found their denials to be nondenials and nonsensical it made no sense that the us ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the south vietnamese ships stone didnt believe it 
stone also filled in the background information the united states had been supporting guerrilla attacks on north vietnam for years prior to the nonincident and stone raised numerous suspicions including the question of why the us ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the nonincident to not occur and the question of why in the world vietnam would take on the united states military something nobody could explain though eugene mccarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored

Daniel Greenfield,lawyer who kept hillary campaign chief out of jail in doj hillary probe,"obamas secret muslim list why enemies of israel and irans goto guy appeared on the list november   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
like a warped islamic version of santa claus obama had a secret muslim list and his people checked it at least twice the list was of muslims who were prospects for important jobs and appointments 
it included a muslim who had described israel as an apartheid state irans goto guy in new york financial circles and a number of figures linked to the muslim brotherhood 
it was the ultimate religious test from an administration that had vocally rejected them 
obama had claimed that having religious tests for migration was shameful and not american 
when i hear folks say that well maybe we should just admit the christians but not the muslims he huffed from turkey his muslim host country was run by a bigoted sponsor of islamic terror 
we dont have religious tests he insisted 
except we did and we do obama also had religious tests his religious tests excluded christians and favored muslims that is why his syrian refugees were between  and  muslim with only  christians and  yazidis even though both groups are real victims of the muslim religious war 
syria is  christian and hundreds of thousands have been displaced yet only  have made it past obamas iron curtain thats either an islamic religious test or the worlds greatest coincidence 
but would the man who piously lectured us on the evils of religious tests really have a religious test 
of course he would 
the hacked emails include a list of muslim american candidates for top administration jobs subcabinet jobs and outside boardsagenciespolicy committees 
the list was sent to john podesta who headed the obamabiden transition project it had been put together by a woman who had sat on the commission on international religious freedom but boasted that she had excluded those with some arab american background but who are not muslim eg george mitchell many lebanese americans for example are christian 
how shameful how not american of barack hussein obama 
most who are listed appear to be muslimamerican except that a handful where noted may be arab american but of uncertain religion esp christian she assured podesta 
religious tests are only out of line when they exclude muslims not when they exclude christians 
thats the pattern which emerged from the obamabiden transition project and obamas refugee policy there has been a clear pattern of administration bias against christians and jews and in favor of muslims that bias has been obvious in a foreign policy which backed islamic supremacist groups such as the muslim brotherhood over more moderate governments at the expense of nonmuslim populations 
this policy led to the displacement and death of countless christians and the persecution of entire communities by an administration which then denied safe harbor to the victims of its own policies 
administration bias replicated that same bigoted policy at home when it favored islamic candidates 
obama appointed farooq kathwari the first name on the muslim list sent to podesta to the presidents advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders 
the muslim list email had warned that kathwaris then yearold americaneducated son irfan aka imran was killed in  fighting jihad against the russians in afghanistan the actions of his son who may have been with the mujahedeen but was also apparently outraged over indias defense of kashmir is of less relevance than kathwaris appearance at an isna conference and another conference cosponsored by the muslim students association both groups are linked to the muslim brotherhood 
he cochaired the american muslim task force whose members included salam almarayati  director of the muslim public affairs council which has defended hamas and hezbollah yahya basha president of the american muslim council and a former board member of the muslim public affairs council and assorted other islamists  its report complained that muslims were inhibited from donating to charities run by islamic terrorist groups such as hezbollah yahya basha also appeared on obamas muslim list 
also listed was mpacs aslam abdullah who had claimed that zionists christians and hindus were behind the war on terror he had described israel as an apartheid state and a racist state 
the second muslim on the list cyrus amirmokri was named assistant treasury secretary he became the first iranian to be named to such a high position and defended the iran nuclear sellout mokri attended a meeting with members of the iran lobby at the white house he also reportedly advised obama on iranian sanctions 
obama had famously told nasa boss bolden that one of his three tasks at the space agency was muslim selfesteem but bolden almost didnt make it in the muslim list included two alternative candidates for nasa administrator one of them dr charles elachi of jpl was dismissed as possibly christian indeed elachi who grew up admiring john wayne and believes that american success is possible because it isnt held back by the longstanding ingrained systems and beliefs found in the middle east would have been a rather poor fit but it is deeply shameful and unamerican that his potential nasa appointment questioned his religion that is an inappropriate religious test that obama must apologize for 
the other name on the list however is firouz naderi an iranian board member of the public affairs alliance of iranian americans which advocated in support of the iran nuke sellout 
eboo patel whose name would frequently appear on lists of islamists in the obama administration first made an appearance on the muslim list despite his islamist ties he got the posting at the advisory council on faithbased neighborhood partnerships also listed were keith ellison andre carson and larry shaw shaw sits on the board of cair 
dilawar syed the first name to appear on the list of possible appointments was named to obamas advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders syed is a cofounder and chair of the asian americans and pacific islander victory fund which has come out for hillary clinton the secret muslim list describes him as animated by policy issues relating to the muslim world a similar description is appended to the bio for kashif zafar who served as a cochair of the south asian american leadership council at the dnc 
also on the list was hamid biglari bloomberg described biglari as irans man in new york and as the iranian presidents goto guy in new york financial circles biglari was a key iran lobby figure 
the recently revealed secret muslim list is deeply troubling there should be no religious test for political appointments yet obama had one and his people sought to screen out christians and favor muslims 
this represents behavior that is in obamas own words shameful and not american one cant help but conclude that based on his own principles obama is shameful and not american",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,71,13,7057,1159,5.053494391716997,1159.0,0.2764223950044397,0.5495749667938356,1.0789768326828213,1.0389871842570009,-0.0351610440900583,1.0748757161823408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.9966,0.063,0.106,0.831,Negative,Very Strong

Daniel Greenfield,fbi releases files on bill clintons cash for pardons scandal,"will james comey change the outcome of the election is this the gamechanging october surprise that many hope for  and others dread november   
bruce thornton is a shillman journalism fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
fbi director james comeys reopening of the investigation into clintons emails has roiled once more the presidential election donald trump has called the decision courageous and bigger than watergate clinton the doj democrat senators and their media flying monkeys are all having conniption fits over their quondam champions defection calling the announcement appalling absurd strange deeply troubling an attack and unprecedented the bigger question is whether it will move enough voters over to trumps side and put him in the white house 
theres no doubt that comeys announcement eleven days before the election is mystifying not because it is unprecedented as the democrats keep squealing they had no such qualms when the weekend before the  election special prosecutor lawrence walsh indicted a pollsurging george hw bush for his alleged involvement in the irancontra scandal no the mystery is comeys motives is comey like conrads lord jim now sacrificing his fbi careersure to be over if the notoriously vengeful clinton is elected to atone for having besmirched his office reputation and the principle of equality before the law in service to careerist selfinterest or was he facing a mutiny and leaks from disgruntled fbi investigators to quote one of our candidates at this point what difference does it make 
the real question is whether it will make a difference to the voters right now we dont know if the content of the  emails from the conjugal laptop used by serial sexter anthony weiner estranged husband of clinton vizier huma abedin will reveal something damning like say classified materials but we already know that clinton passed classified information over an unsecured server which didnt bother comey back in july so what could be in these new emails that rises above comeys sophistic extreme carelessness and reaches the statutes gross negligence or has comey found new evidence of hillarys intent his other exculpatory sophistry that had little to do with the law there had to be something that made comey subject himself to the scorchedearth wrath of the democrats 
whatever is found on the abedin laptop one wonders if will even matter to a sufficient number of voters they have shrugged off so many scandals lies and failures that should have sunk a candidacy that its hard to calculate what level of incompetence unpleasantness dishonesty sleaze and crime is disqualifying anymore here are the greatest hits from hillarys catalogue whitewater missing billing records from her tenure at the rose law firm renting out the lincoln bedroom to donors travelgate illegal possession of fbi files conducting illegal secret meetings of the task force on national health care reform cackling over keeping a pedophile rapist out of jail hounding the victims of her husbands sexual assaults and philandering stealing  worth of china furniture and artwork from the white house claiming she landed under sniper fire in bosnia claiming she and bill left the white house dead broke shaking down wall street while assuring the orcs of capitalism that shes got their back charging exorbitant speaking fees for a half hour of banalities and bromides calling  missing emails personal communications lying about the benghazi attack to the faces of the four dead americans families supporting the lie that the attacks were caused by an obscure internet video when she knew the same night that they werent perjuring herself before congress and the fbi about the emails and her private server the disastrous overthrow of ghaddafi in libya the disastrous reset with russia the disastrous nuclear deal with iran the disastrous withdrawal from iraq the corrupt clinton foundation and its wholly owned subsidiary the paytoplay state department using feminist rhetoric while taking cash from some of the planets most brutally misogynistic regimes serially flipflopping on issues like samesex marriage the trans pacific trade deal and the keystone pipeline promising to raise taxes on the middle class and put coal miners out of work her campaign staffs dirty tricks against trump and his supporters her campaign staffs incestuous relationship with the media her staffs illegal destruction of incriminating evidence during the email investigation her strong support of gruesome lateterm abortions and last but not least the continuing unanswered questions about her physical and cognitive health 
back in the day just a few of these gaffes deceptions and failures would probably have sunk a campaign for congress let alone the white house 
and mr trumps offenses hes talks exactly as youd expect a new york real estate developer casino owner reality television star and beauty pageant mogul to talk hes condemned as a sexual assaulter for saying a decade ago what bill clinton and every whitehousevisiting rapper movie star or rock star knows about the sexual perks of celebrity when youre a star they let you do it as trump bragged of his crude sexual advances hes ignorant of policy he doesnt understand the economics of global trade he doesnt know what the nuclear triad is hes addicted to a half dozen superlative adjectives he wants to build a wall with mexico he takes legal advantage of tax law hes not suitable for office he does not have the right temperament hes used bankruptcy as a business tool hes accused of groping over a dozen women including a polymorphously perverse porn star hes mean and insulting he has orange hair 
in short trump lacks the superficial patina of rhetorical decorum and sober demeanor that most modern presidents and candidates spray over their public personas in order to hide their private flaws and vices just ask hillarys various secret service details how wide the distance between public and private personalities can be 
the voters will decide for themselves which candidates catalogue of sins is more disqualifying and dangerous but whatever happens its clear that we the people have lowered the bar of acceptability for presidential candidates 
this transformation happened decades before trump and hillary came along after bill clinton was impeached for perjury related to his sordid sexual depredations in the white house his approval ratings were  he left the white house with a  rating higher than any president since harry truman including ronald reagan think about it the president who sexually exploited an intern and was impeached for perjury left office with higher approval ratings than the president who rescued the economy and tossed the soviet union into its own dustbin of history 
that was the inflection point for our political culture no wonder that barack obamas lack of any realworld experience or achievement leftwing views selfconfessed drug use friends like the antiamerican racist jeremiah wright and unrepentant terrorist bill ayers and gaping holes in his biography were unimportant to  million voters so why now are we shocked shocked that offbrand candidates like hillary clinton and donald trump are vying for the presidency decrying these candidates is closing the barn door after the horses of virtue wisdom and decorum have already long gone 
so absent a smoking howitzer in the next wikileaks dump comeys restart of the investigation which in any case will take months to complete will probably not be the gamechanging october surprise many hope for and others dread especially given a corrupt medias studied indifference to anything that damages their candidate then again the rapid erosion of hillarys support is drawing analogies to reagans late surge against carter 
either way on november  most people will vote their economic interests and their ideological passions and decide based on subjective perceptions and silly criteria like cares for people like me or they might just finally realize that hillarys accumulated offenses are intolerable but what that standard of selection will deliver is anybodys guess",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,60,10,8121,1301,5.224442736356648,1301.0,-0.0599030377694696,-0.0141271790859303,1.3604810890503052,1.2615978564460602,0.1335482070536799,1.302690938563081,0.0023059185242121,0.1,0.0,1,1,0.2257630689823525,0.0042253032382676,-0.9993,0.088,0.17,0.742,Negative,Very Strong

Larsen Halleck,why its necessary to relax into a stretch,"home this month popular why its absolutely worth it to learn game why its absolutely worth it to learn game 
jon enjoys helping others evolve into their best selves on his blog masculine development and recently launched his ebook on  strategies to develop your masculinity november   game 
after my previous article  which advocated that men learn game as a form of selfdevelopment i got a good amount of disagreementmost of it was not inaccurate the majority of rok readers are becoming less and less interested in learning game simply because western women are not as attractive as they once were 
this isnt to say that weve abandoned learning game as a whole certainly we still want to get laid and eventually find a girl for a relationship but nonetheless there seems to be a large portion of the manosphere which simply doesnt believe that game is worth it anymore 
in this article i would like to present a very realistic and objective perspective in regards to learning game in retrospect my last article may have been too focused on the positive aspects i do not wear the rose colored glasses in regards to the game in fact its quite the opposite 
as a veteran myself im quite aware of the troubles that men can encounter when learning game ive been slapped for making mildly offensive jokes ive had drinks thrown on me ive had guys threaten to slit my throat and more despite this however i still believe that it is  worth it to learn game beginners hell how dare you try to ask me my name you fucking rapist 
i believe that the reason why most men dont feel that game is worth it is because they experience difficulty getting over a period known as beginners hell this is when youre just starting to shrug off your feminist conditioning  and you havent developed the confidence or game that you need to succeed 
most beginners walk around not really knowing how to talk to women  how to carry themselves or how to flirt in general because of this women will typically have one of two responses they pity you and ignore you they lash out and berate you for being a creep or weird 
of course you may get the occasional girl whos drunk enough to be into you but these are few and far between for the most part the beginners hell phase of learning game is absolutely horrendous 
you will be sometimes be targeted by club douchebags who will either confront you or use their superior social intelligence to embarrass you and on the rare occasion that you do manage to get a girl talking to you hell come over and steal her you will have women smack you ignore you and tell you offagain its called beginners hell for a reason s who think theyre s 
this initial difficulty in learning game is only compounded by our cultures general lack of femininity it is extremely obvious to anyone with eyes to see that women in our culture are encouraged to be less and less feminine as time goes on the once praised virtues of nurturing empathy and kindness have now been replaced by resting bitch face sociopathy and social climbing 
this coupled with the fact that women experience an endless supply of beta orbiters means that theyve been conditioned to believe theyre highly sought after goddesses who can use men like tissues without any sort of social repercussions and in fact theyre sometimes praised for doing so 
this is perhaps one of the biggest obstacles to newbies struggling to learn game couple this with severe approach anxiety a complete lack of masculinity and a weak body that hasnt been trained and its very easy to see why most men dont see that game is worth it the turning point 
once one gets beyond this initial bump however most of game is smooth sailing once the newbie has learned how to fix his lack of masculinity how to balance assertiveness with consent  and has improved his game in general he enters what i call the turning point 
the turning point is essentially that point at which learning game is no longer a struggle but its actually enjoyable this is due to several key lifestyle and mindset shifts which take place as the newbie gets more and more success such as drawing state from within rather than from without being in a state of abundance rather than scarcity improving other areas of your life which creates an upwards spiral 
if youre a newbie struggling to learn game and you dont feel like its worth it i fully empathize with your painthe problem is that when you dont have much game of course learning game will be hard because you get stuck with the bitchy fat girls 
when you start to develop the three characteristics that i mentioned however a cascade of effects starts to take place that catapults your game to the next level this allows you to pick and choose which hot girls you want rather than being at the mercy of the ugly  who might want to come over and hang out internal vs external drawing of state by my age you realize that bitches aint shit but hoes and tricks 
the transition from drawing state from outside of you to drawing state from within you is literally the difference between a guy that doesnt pull at all and a guy that can pull victorias secret models 
let me explain women typically draw state from without this means that their emotions are governed by their environment this is why they respond so much more to social pressure than men why they just want to dance when a song they like comes on and its why theyre generally so emotionally volatile 
due to their changing environments their emotions change rapidly as well this is why they want men to draw state from within or in other words not be affected by their outside environments this is why women are repulsed by men who care too much about their opinions its indicative of a man who draws state from without 
as a man drawing state from within has numerous benefits the most obvious of which being that youre perpetually in a good mood once you learn to make this shift and learn to be happy regardless of your external circumstances women will pick up on it like a hawktheyre very attuned to this type of thing and youll definitely notice a difference in their behavior 
this will get them vying for your attention which will start to give you tremendous power this will make game fun which will lead to even more women in your life which will begin the start of your upward spiral the beginning of the upward spiral 
once you begin to make this simple mindset shift game will no longer feel like its not worth it you see game feels like its not worth it when you have to put in a huge amount of effort for a below average looking girl with a horrible personality but when you start to get to the point where you can put in a medium amount of effort for a very gorgeous woman thats when game starts to be fun 
this basic mindset shift of learning to not care what your environment is like and to simply be happy by yourself will create a chain reaction within your life first youll start to get much more women much more easily this will allow you to start a harem which will keep you in a perpetual state of abundance until you find a girl you want for a relationship 
this state of abundance will amplify your game by about five fold women will sense that youve got a ton of other women vying for your attention and they will do the sameits like a magnet that just draws them in plus if a girl does or says something that you dislike you can simply kick her out of your life since you have so many other women 
then when you start to have so many women in your life youll start to friend zone hot girls for the social benefits  because you simply cant handle sleeping with all of them theyll invite you to parties and try to hook you up with their friends and youll receive many of the social benefits that they do game is worth it it just sucks at first getting over beginners hell is a lot like this once you get to the other side its all downhill though 
as i have made clear learning game at first is a huge struggleyou will encounter massive cock blocks a lot of negativity from women and not to mention youll have to deal with all of the white knights too but if you can learn to get over this initial beginners hell as ive coined it you will see the other side of reality that most men are shielded from 
i realize that it can be very difficult to learn game at first and can feel like it isnt worth it but if you make a decision to put in the effort and learn it your world will literally be x better than before if youre struggling with learning game initially be sure to maximize your appearance 
get some height increasing soles read through some of the style articles on rok get a good designer haircut and learn to perfect your appearance at least as much as you can consider taking some martial arts classes to boost your confidence as well 
ultimately however if you want to learn game and experience what its like to have dozens of hot girls hitting you up you just have to bite the bullet and go out go clubbing go to bars go on trips to las vegas or miami approach women during the day and approach them during the nighteventually youll get over this beginners hell and will experience an abundance of women in your life",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,85.16960871803,41,8,9180,1687,4.419087136929461,1687.0,-0.6408287852880403,-0.3899286096724409,1.6406624870701974,1.8667226414106863,-0.6612587878323192,1.9219633036262196,0.0059276822762299,0.0,0.0011855364552459,0,0,0.0,0.0094201060762316,0.993,0.142,0.11,0.748,Positive,Very Strong

thursday october   by vicki batts tags cancer  chemotherapy  ineffective medicine naturalnews chemotherapy is arguably one of the medical industrys biggest frauds  perhaps thats why it recently landed on a list of ineffectual treatments drawn up by the academy of medical royal colleges amrcthe list was created by  top specialists who were each asked to think of five treatments they felt provided little to no patient benefits and surprise surprise  chemotherapy was one of them doctors from the amrc said that chemotherapy cannot cure terminal cancer and may bring unneeded distress in the final months of life the guardian reportedthe treatment is by its very nature toxic the college said therefore the combination of failing to achieve a response and causing toxicity can do more harm than gooddo more harm than good you dont sayresearch has shown that in some hospitals up to  percent of cancer patients are dying not from their disease but from chemotherapy drugs for the first time ever researchers actually looked at the numbers of patients who were dying within  days of chemotherapy administration  which could indicate that the treatment was the cause of death rather than the cancer what they found was horrifyingthe study which was conducted by public health england and cancer research uk found that the average day mortality rate across england was about  percent for lung cancer and  percent for breast cancer but in some hospitals those numbers were much higher for example at lancashire teaching hospitals the  day mortality rate for palliative chemotherapy for lung cancer was  percent in milton keynes the death rate for lung cancer treatment soared up to  percentthe research revealed that the death rate for lung cancer patients was higher than average in several areas including blackpool coventry derby south tyneside surrey and sussexthe data also revealed that about in people who underwent palliative care for breast cancer at cambridge university hospitals died because of chemotherapy treatmentof course the industry was quick to defend their practices with doctors suggesting that these occurrences could simply be the outcome of data problems noting that even a few deaths could skew statisticshowever no one really argued with the fact that chemotherapy is indeed a toxin it doesnt discriminate it kills cancerous cells and healthy cells  and therein lies the rub it may kill the cancer but not without increasing your risks of getting cancer again in the futurea  study also found that cytotoxic chemotherapy does very little towards enhancing cancer survivors year survival rates the research which was led by scientists from the department of radiation oncology at the northern sydney cancer centre of the royal north shore hospital located in sydney australia raised serious questions about the actual efficacy of curative and adjuvant chemotherapieswhat they found was that in australia chemo only contributed  percent to the year survival rate in adults and in the us that number dropped to  percent these findings suggest that overall chemotherapy truly provides very little benefit to any patients survival in their conclusion the study authors wrote as the year relative survival rate for cancer in australia is now over  it is clear that cytotoxic chemotherapy only makes a minor contribution to cancer survival to justify the continued funding and availability of drugs used in cytotoxic chemotherapy a rigorous evaluation of the costeffectiveness and impact on quality of life is urgently requiredthe amrc urges doctors and patients to question whether or not particular treatments are necessary after all unwarranted and harmful treatments are truly anything but medicine  sources",legorafi.fr,Fake,english,16.684927674847486,47.88118811881188,33,6,3806,596,5.350671140939597,596.0,-0.8854291000327017,-0.7657300402589515,0.2188543350787895,0.1563828994510817,0.2581232630751265,0.1716364894192653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.9991,0.059,0.214,0.727,Negative,Very Strong

britain is deploying troops aircraft and armor in the biggest military buildup in eastern europe since the cold war 
the deployment which was first floated in the press by uk defense chiefs on wednesday appears to have been prepared well in advance 
it will see up to  armored infantry troops deployed to estonia and royal air force raf fighter jets deployed to romania in what appears to be a reiteration of the strategy of containment employed against the soviet union during the cold war 
france and denmark will also commit more troops 
on wednesday uk defence secretary michael fallon struck a belligerent tone in the wall street journal when he warned that europe  is our continent  and as such would be defended 
while he claimed the force would be  defensive in nature  he pledged it would be  fully combatcapable  a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
he denied the placement of small formations around the baltic area are merely a  tripwire  in case of the muchheralded but hypothetical clash with russia 
 this is a serious military presence  he said 
tensions have only just begun to subside after a fleet of russian naval vessels bound for the mediterranean sea passed through the north sea and english channel 
the passage caused a press frenzy in the uk framed as though russia was launching an invasion of the british isles the royal navy deployed destroyers to in fallons words  manmark  the vessels while the raf overflew the ships with fighter jets 
according to the russian military the naval groups task was to  ensure a naval presence in operationally significant areas of the worlds oceans  as well as  the safety of maritime navigation and other maritime economic activities  of russia

were not talking about debbie wasserman schultz the exmuppet in charge of the dnc who was forced to resign because of the way the dnc rigged the process to favor hillary this is donna brazile who was brought in to replace her to bring back integrity to the dnc since brazile is another clinton loyalist that was never going to happen 
but the latest leak reveals that brazile had passed along a second debate question to hillary all this just emphasizes how fraudulent and rigged the whole debate process was 
another leaked email has emerged showing democratic national committee boss and former cnn contributor donna brazile sharing a debate question in advance with the hillary clinton campaign  despite braziles persistent claims to the contrary 
cnn announced in a statement soon after the email became public monday that brazile had tendered her resignation and the network accepted it on oct  days after the controversy over brazile tipping off the clinton campaign initially broke 
according to documents released monday by wikileaks brazile sent clinton communications director jennifer palmieri an email titled one of the questions directed to hrc tomorrow is from a woman with a rash the night before the march  cnn primary debate in flint mich 
her family has lead poison and she will ask what if anything will hillary do as president to help the ppl of flint brazile wrote 
the following night leeanne walters a mom whose twin boys stopped growing and whose daughter lost her hair during the flint water contamination crisis posed a question to both clinton the eventual democratic presidential nominee and her primary opponent vermont sen bernie sanders

the federal government is trying to recoup enlistment bonuses given erroneously to thousands of california soldiers despite routinely allowing poorperforming va employees to keep their bonus checks 
the los angeles times reported last week that the pentagon demanded that thousands of california soldiers repay bonuses they were given to fight in iraq and afghanistan the defense department asked the soldiers to repay the bonuses which amounted to  or more each after audits revealed they were overpaid by the california national guard 
but the practice stands in contrast with that of the obama administrations department of veterans affairs which has failed to take back hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to highranking bureaucrats who have been scrutinized for bad behavior or poor management

a new report is painting cia director james comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election as comey sent a letter about hillary clintons emails but refused to call out russia for meddling in the election by hacking democrats 
cnbc reported  fbi director james comey argued privately that it was too close to election day for the united states government to name russia as meddling in the us election and ultimately ensured that the fbis name was not on the document that the us government put out a former fbi official tells cnbc 
 
according to the former official comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to a foreign power was trying to undermine the election he believed it to be true but was against putting it out before the election comeys position this official said was if it is said it shouldnt come from the fbi which as youll recall it did not 
director comey didnt want to interfere in the presidential election by releasing information that could harm republican presidential nominee donald trump but he had no qualms about sending a letter to congress about emails that he had never seen in an apparent effort to interfere in the current presidential election 
with each new revelation and detail it is becoming impossible not to come to the conclusion that fbi director comey may have violated the hatch act with his letter to congress it is illegal for federal employees to use their positions to interfere in elections 
when the information was bad for donald trump comey argued that it should not be publicly released so close to the election however he embraced a different standard when he had less information but could frame it in a way that could damage hillary clintons campaign

Sean Colarossi,donald trump may have broken the law to avoid paying federal income taxes,"interviews james clapper director of us national intelligence agency speaks at the council of foreign relations in new york city on october   afp photo 
james clapper the us director of national intelligence has warned that the establishment of a nofly zone in syria could prompt russia to shoot down us planes this comes as hillary clinton the democratic nominee for the  us presidential election has called for establishing a nofly zone in the arab country russia has recently deployed mobile s and s missile batteries to western syria which are ready to shoot down cruise missiles and aircraft 
gordon duff a senior editor with the veterans today told press tv that james clapper who spoke out against former secretary of states emphasis on a nofly zone over syria is responsible because the american officials obtain their intelligence on the syrian conflict from the spy chief 
the public position of the united states visàvis syria was established based on intelligence supplied exclusively by james clapper duff noted adding he clapper is the one that talks about the gas hes the one who talks about the barrel bombs and everything thats been disproven 
he said every crazy scheme that the us comes up with to blame syria for killing its own people or the russians for slaughtering people in hospitals it all comes from james clapper the director of the national intelligence agency who fed that information to secretary clinton who fed that information to president barack obama 
clinton said that she favored a nofly zone only if acceptable for both russia and damascus and after negotiations which is a very different story than the one said by the spy chief for political purposes duff said 
duff added that the imposition of nofly zone obviously is going to help no one but alnusra front and isis daesh terrorists 
damascus and moscow carry out airstrikes against terrorist groups who wreak havoc in the arab country but the us and its allies push for imposing a nofly zone on syria to pursue their agenda in the warridden state

Jon Anthony,goals for the neomasculinity movement during trumps first term," very depressing economic realities that donald trump will inherit from barack obama   th  
it would be a grave mistake to understate the amount of damage that has been done to the us economy over the past eight years in this article i am going to share some economic numbers with you that are extremely sobering anyone that takes a cold hard honest look at the numbers should be able to see that our economy is in terrible shape unfortunately the way that we see things is often clouded by our political views up until the election democrats were far more likely then republicans to believe that the economy was improving but now that is in the process of completely reversing according to gallup  only  percent of republicans believed that the economy was getting better before the election but that number has suddenly jumped to  percent after trumps election victory and the percentage of democrats that believe that the economy is getting better fell from  percent to  percent after the election here are some additional details from gallup  
after trump won last weeks election republicans and republicanleaning independents now have a much more optimistic view of the us economys outlook than they did   just  of republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election while  said it was getting worse since the election  say it is getting better and  worse 
conversely democrats and democraticleaning independents confidence in the economy plummeted after the election before the election  of democrats said the economy was getting better and  worse now democrats are evenly divided with  saying it is getting better and  saying it is getting worse 
the truth of course is that the result of the election did not somehow magically alter the outlook for the us economy 
we still have a giant mess on our hands and the following are  very depressing economic realities that donald trump will inherit from barack obama 
 nearly  out of every  americans have less than  in savings  that means that about twothirds of the country is essentially living paycheck to paycheck at this moment 
 reuters is reporting that us mall investors are poised to lose billions of dollars as the  retail apocalypse  in this nation deepens 
 credit card delinquencies have hit the highest level that we have seen since   
 approximately  percent of all americans have a debt that is at least  days past due 
 the rate of homeownership has fallen for eight years in a row and is now hovering near a  year low  
 the total number of government employees now outnumbers the total number of manufacturing employees in this country by almost  million  
 the number of homeless people in new york city where donald trump is from has hit a brand new record high  
 about  percent of all young adults are currently living with their parents  
 total household debt in the united states has now reached a grand total of  trillion dollars  
 the total amount of corporate debt in the us has nearly doubled since the end of  
 when barack obama entered the white house the us government was  trillion dollars in debt today the us national debt is currently sitting at a staggering total of   
despite nearly doubling the national debt during his eight years in the white house barack obama is going to be the only president in united states history to never have a single year when us gdp grew by at least three percent 
so will donald trump waltz in and suddenly turn everything around 
just like when george w bush was elected there is a lot of optimism about the future right now among republicans 
and in  republicans are going to have control of the senate and the house in addition to being in control of the white house 
but does that mean that they will actually get anything done 
for a moment lets review what didnt happen the last time the republicans were in this position the following is an extended excerpt from an article by author devvy kidd   the republicans had control of both houses of congress part of the time during bush jrs two terms did they lock down our borders no did they pass legislation to stop all funding for illegals which would selfdeport millions of liars cheats and thieves no read please how to selfdeport millions of illegals  did they stop trillions in unconstitutional spending no did they get rid of any of clintons unconstitutional executive orders one or two but otherwise let comrade bill clinton crap in our faces did they get rid of one unconstitutional cabinet like hhs department of education and epa no did they stop the unconstitutional foreign aid no did they stop unconstitutional spending for planned parenthood no congress just continues to use borrowed money to spend more debt did they stop unconstitutional spending for the gigantic hoax called global warming or climate change no trump the left just lost the war on climate change did bush jr get us out of all the destructive trade treaties killing american jobs no did they crack down on visas bringing in tens of thousands of foreign workers when american workers who want to work are left in the unemployment line no did they stop more and more federal regulations strangling americas businesses no did they impeach one single activist judge destroying our freedom and liberty no a republican controlled congress with a republican in the white house and they did virtually nothing to restore america to a constitutional republic and constitutional spending  
so will things be any different under a trump administration 
we shall see 
there will be tremendous pressure to maintain the status quo in many instances because the process of fixing things would undoubtedly make conditions worse in the shortterm 
a great example of this is the national debt as i discussed yesterday  the only reason why we are able to enjoy such a massively inflated standard of living in this country     federal government started spending only the money that it brought in through taxes our ridiculous debt  would begin collapsing immediately 
we consume far more wealth than we produce and the only way that we are able to do this is by borrowing insane amounts of money 
either donald trump will continue to borrow money recklessly or we will go into a major league economic downturn 
it really is that simple 
but when our politicians borrow money they are literally destroying the future of this country so the choice is pain in the shortterm or greater pain in the longterm 
there is a way out and that would involve shutting down the federal reserve and going to a completely debtfree form of money but that is a topic for another article 
and unfortunately that is not something that is even on donald trumps radar at this point 
no matter who won the election the next president was going to be faced with some very harsh economic realities 
there are many out there that have faith that donald trump can pull off an unprecedented economic miracle but there are others that are deeply skeptical 
let us hope for the best but let us also keep preparing for the worst",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,72.91704389050463,62,9,7069,1201,4.802664446294754,1201.0,0.0012470409166957,-0.2020278943791856,1.0821516927170411,1.1048297774396802,-0.2827056011655525,1.1422576833653766,0.0033305578684429,0.0,0.0008326394671107,0,0,0.0,0.0052464545580306,-0.9977,0.098,0.157,0.745,Negative,Very Strong
Ari Lieberman,obamas weighs options for his final stab at israel,"the unraveling of hillarys corrupt sphere of influence november   michael cutler 
the  elections are in the final stretch and were shaken to the core by the latest revelations from fbi director james comey on friday october   as reported by nbc news on october  th   fbi obtains warrant for newly discovered emails in clinton probe  as reid accuses comey of hatch act violation  once again the clinton scandal is creating turmoil in a presidential election that has gone way beyond unconventional indeed tom clancy could not have scripted this years presidential election and intrigues 
while comeys recent remarks regarding the clinton investigation have been extremely vague the issue to focus on is how hillarys use of a private computer server private email account and nonsecure digital devices to store send and receive classified materials may have drawn others into her tangled web of deception 
the current focus of the clinton quagmire is on whether or not the laptop computer shared by weiner and his estranged wife contains sensitive information if that laptop had been hacked both weiner and abedin could have been vulnerable to blackmail this was an issue raised by congressman louie gohmert texan republican and former judge in a fox news business interview on october   in a segment that was posted under the title  rep gohmert clinton is a potential victim of blackmail  
additional individuals may also have been drawn into this web of deception through these emails as well a chain is as strong as its weakest link the weak links begin with hillary clinton and huma abedin and may now include anthony weiner and perhaps others meanwhile there is no way to yet determine how many other weak links are out there petrified that wikileaks or perhaps a hacker may yet disclose their improper dealings with the clintons or their foundation 
could not these additional individuals be subject to blackmail as well 
lets take a moment to understand how all of this began 
just months earlier hillary clinton had been let off the hook by an fbi director who in his official statement on july    included this excerpt to be clear this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences to the contrary those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions but that is not what we are deciding now 
by comeys own words anyone else might have had their security clearance lifted permanently this raises the issue about such an individual demonstrating fitness for duty as president and raises the question as to why comey did not see fit to take comparable action with ms clinton 
comeys ultimate decision to not present the case to a grand jury was frustrating to those who have had security clearances and fully understand just how profound an impact these transgressions might have on national security 
however perhaps comeys hard to comprehend decision can be traced to a meeting between bill clinton and attorney general loretta lynch less than one week before the fbi director conducted that press conference on june   abc news reported  us attorney general loretta lynch bill clinton meet privately in phoenix before benghazi report  
that article served as a predication for my article  loretta lynchs private meeting with bill clinton prior to release of benghazi report  why would the attorney general who sets the tone for law enforcement do this 
as attorney general lynch is fbi director comeys boss 
at the time of this meeting the justice department was not only investigating hillarys illegal use of a private email server nonsecure personal digital devices but was also conducting an investigation into the clinton foundation 
in fact on october   breitbart reported  clinton foundation fbi investigation confirmed by former assistant fbi director  therefore bill clinton was likely the target of an ongoing criminal investigation yet he had a totally inappropriate private meeting with the attorney general to supposedly discuss golfing and grandchildren 
however just days after that meeting news organizations reported that hillary was contemplating keeping lynch on as attorney general if she won the election 
on july   newsmax reported  ny times clinton weighs keeping lynch as attorney general if she wins  hillarys statement that she might keep lynch on as attorney general could have provided the incentive for lynch to go along to get along 
indeed lynch did precisely that during her confirmation hearing as i described in my commentary  loretta lynch same as the old boss  the attorney general nominees disturbing views on us immigration law 
my article included an excerpt from a yahooap news report attorney general nominee defends obama immigration changes here is the exchange in which lynch discussed the administrations immigrations policies lynch said she had no involvement in drafting the measures but called them a reasonable way to marshal limited resources to deal with the problem of illegal immigration she said the homeland security department was focusing on removals of the most dangerous of the undocumented immigrants among us pressed by sen jeff sessions of alabama a leading immigration hardliner she said citizenship was not a right for people in the country illegally but rather a privilege that must be earned however when sessions asked whether individuals in the country legally or those who are here unlawfully have more of a right to a job lynch replied the right and the obligation to work is one thats shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here sessions quickly issued a news release to highlight that response under later questioning by democratic sen chuck schumer of new york lynch clarified it stating there is no right to work for an immigrant who has no lawful status 
this was disturbing and telling clearly ms lynchs views on immigration and likely therefore on other issues are malleable and subject to revision if modifying her position is consistent with her personal goals 
as attorney general lynch directs the operations of the entire justice department and all those who work for that department ms lynch must understand true democracy can only exist when justice is blind and totally objective 
however lynch and the others who have fallen under hillary clintons corrupt sphere of influence are trapped in hillarys web of deception having fallen victim to the hillary virus throughout clintons many decades in american politics this highly contagious and virulent malady has proven to be virtually ineradicable it is not likely to change no matter the outcome of the next election",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,84.45285857853474,50,9,6671,1080,5.127777777777778,1080.0,-0.3656534312002963,-0.2020278943791856,0.976852168248753,0.9151404018419604,0.0381493729318373,0.9481334445761542,0.0037037037037037,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.006488144410722,-0.9835,0.068,0.097,0.834,Negative,Very Strong

if you had wanted to give trump supporters the benefit of the doubt this most recent incident proves that its far too much to give them 
a yearold man in allen park michigan has just been charged with six felonies after he held six children at gunpoint because he thought theyd damaged the donald trump sign on his lawn yes this is the kind of deranged emotionally unstable supporters trump has attracted 
the man michael robert kubek had called police on october th to report that his trump sign had been hit by teenagers who had fled the scene when the police arrived at the scene they didnt find kubek at his home  however when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner there he was 
the police saw kubek standing over six children ages  who were sitting on the grass kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it the children denied any involvement and the officers told kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children 
according to the kids they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them instructing them to sit down on the grass those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock twitter twitter 
the newsherald reported 
the officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign but kubek repeated that he could not the officer then asked kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids according to police kubek said yes 
in response to another question from the officer kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered 
yes a grown man used a gun because he felt outnumbered by a small group of innocent kids this is exactly the type of unhinged person who shouldnt be trusted with firearms kubeks hearing is scheduled for december th  lets hope that whatever happens to kubek that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner you can watch a report below

Kelen M,trump promotes world peace as hillary calls for war,"vitamin d deficiency dirty air doubles your risk of dementia  in  americans will struggle with alzheimers by  image credits geraltpixabay  
dementia is one of the most common and debilitating illnesses that older americans face today 
however recent studies have suggested that air pollution may be one of the top causes for the contribution of the diseases growth 
by   in  americans will suffer from alzheimers alzheimers is the most potent form of dementia and often ends in the patient unable to remember how to do daily and necessary tasks like eating or using the restroom this will rival the current diabetes and obesity crises seen today 
recent studies have confirmed that a variety of environmental factors are at play when it comes to dementia 
doctors have noted that those who are deficient in vitamin d are  more likely to develop dementia than those who get in the necessary amount 
a vitamin d deficiency can also be associated with brittle or soft bones as well as depression it is recommended that everyone gets at least  minutes of sunlight per day in order to ensure they have enough vitamin d as well as eat fortified dairy products or salmon liver and red meat vitamin d can also be obtained through supplementation or fish oil 
however doctors have found that the biggest environmental risk for dementia lies in air pollution 
in fact the problem is so great that those who live in a city with high pollution can double their risk of develop dementia within  or  months living there 
recent studies have also shown that postmortem examinations of the brains of those who have lived in highly polluted areas contain traces of magnetite this chemical compound may be partially responsible for the memory impairments associated with dementia 
the risk of developing dementia if you are exposed to air pollution increases exponentially if you are obese 
researchers say that those concerned about the epidemic can combat it by living somewhere with as little pollution as possible maintaining a health intake of vitamin d and exercising 
according to research exercise is imperitive when it comes to staving off the illness dr laura baker who ran a study on dementia and exercise stated 
these findings are important because they strongly suggest a potent lifestyle intervention such as aerobic exercise can impact alzheimersrelated changes in the brain no currently approved medication can rival these effects newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,6.250377223837964,51,9,2542,415,5.067469879518073,415.0,-0.3350783918572136,-0.2020278943791856,-0.1155642551923566,-0.1273673235504659,-0.0213686082155959,-0.1187477024885795,0.0024096385542168,0.0,0.0024096385542168,0,0,0.0,0.0042668977648533,0.3818,0.103,0.091,0.806,Positive,Moderate

trump fans may have won the election but they arent taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of michelle obama the donalds deplorables were out in force after the first lady posed for the cover of vogue 
i could have spent eight years doing anything  and at some level it would have been fine obama told the magazine  i could have focused on flowers i could have focused on decor i could have focused on entertainment because any first lady rightfully gets to define her role theres no legislative authority youre not elected and thats a wonderful gift of freedom 
in exercising her freedom michelle obama has done quite a bit to push education healthy eating and support for our veterans  and in exercising their freedom the right has responded with nothing but hate the reaction to the first lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical readers of yahoo news showered obama with racist remarks calling her an ape and a monkey and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes 
if you thought this behavior would stop after the election you were wrong trump fans are not done by a long shot  and now they have been emboldened by america electing its first official kkk candidate

in  project hemisphere was shown in a powerpoint presentation produced by the drug enforcement administration the new york times reported this as a partnership between att and the doj primarily deployed for drugenforcement taskforces all information collected in this program is accessible to the federal agencies authorized by the doj 
att specifically developed and marketed this product for use by the doj who would promise hundreds of millions in funds on behalf of taxpayers using the taxpayers own money to spy on their every move this is an invasion of privacy without a warrant this is a federal spy program by proxy working through corporations 
att promises law enforcement that it will not disclose project hemispheres involvement in active investigations that are made public att is is attempting to lower liability for their customer and limit scrutiny to information transmitted to federal agencies through their network 
while it should not be surprising that your cell phone company is working with bureaucrats to collect incriminating evidence on you there is a staggering number of people who still carelessly use their cell phone as if the information being transmitted through the device will be kept private

Jonathan Brooks,comment on hillary clinton is an alcoholic by jonathan brooks,"posted on october   by daisy luther 
oh loretta 
ill bet that ag loretta lynch is shaking in her boots right now because when hillary clinton goes down lynchs career will go down with her heck maybe theyll even be cellmates 
loretta lynchs ties to the clintons go back to  when thenpresident bill clinton appointed her to run the brooklyn us attorneys office she left in  and went into private practice but returned to the brooklyn office in  at the behest of president barack obama  heres her official bio  
in  she was sworn in to become the rd attorney general of the united states taking the place of the blatantly corrupt attorney general eric holder  who will probably be most famous for his roles in the fast and furious operation inciting racial tensions and his mishandling of the lois lernerirs debacle first there was the secret airplane meeting with bill clinton 
it all started to publicly go downhill for lynch during the first investigation into hillary clintons carelessness with national secrets via her home email server  right before fbi director james comey was to meet with hillary clinton to interrogate her about the subject lynch was busted having a secret meeting with bill clinton  the washington post reported 
clintons private unplanned meeting with attorney general loretta e lynch at the phoenix airport last week coming at a time when the justice department should be nearing completion of its examination of hillary clintons use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state will inevitably  and negatively  affect public attitudes about that investigation 
lynch has tried to make amends though not without leaving some confusion in her wake in a conversation friday with washington post editorial writer jonathan capehart at the aspen ideas festival she insisted again that the conversation was innocent  about grandchildren and golf and such  and did not touch on the investigation of the emails but she said she recognized that others would not see it that way the fact that the meeting that i had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that i take seriously and deeply and painfully she said 
lynch said that she would be accepting whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and fbi director james b comey bring her  though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case she also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public 
of course it was all much easier for lynch to abide by the decision when comey miraculously found that hillary clinton was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets 
now though people are asking questions about that illfounded meeting judicial watch has filed a lawsuit for all records related to the illicit meeting between attorney general lynch and former president bill clinton  
on june   attorney general loretta lynch is reported to have met privately with former president bill clinton on board a parked private plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the thenongoing investigation of mrs clintons email server and mere hours before the benghazi report was released publicly involving both mrs clinton and the obama administration judicial watch filed a request on june  that the us department of justice office of the inspector general investigate that meeting 
republican presidential nominee donald trump suggested that during that meeting bill clinton may have offered to extend lynchs position in the ags office during a hillary clinton administration then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious iranian ransom payment 
last week ag lynch blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the obama administration made to iran by pleading the fifth the washington free beacon reported 
attorney general loretta lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran  billion in cash earlier this year prompting accusations that lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon  
it is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the peoples elected representatives in congress about an important national security issue the lawmakers wrote your staff failed to address any of our questions and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue 
as the united states chief law enforcement officer it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries they stated the actions of your department come at time when iran continues to hold americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison 
how very judicial of her lynch tried to shut comey up about the new investigation into the clinton emails 
now even the mainstream media cant turn its head 
earlier i wrote about the fact that fbi director james comey made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the hillary clinton emails but lets talk a little further about lynchs desperate attempts to shut him up 
the new york times reported that the justice department strongly discouraged comey against releasing the information the day before the fbi director james b comey sent a letter to congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed hillary clinton email investigation the justice department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy three law enforcement officials said on saturday senior justice department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter officials said but they did everything short of it pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections 
how interesting that its seen as influencing the election to investigate someone now but it wasnt back when she was investigated and not charged im not sure exactly how that works but according to usa today emphasis mine a federal official familiar with comeys decision said saturday that the fbi director considered the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter thursday and early friday but felt compelled to act do you remember janet reno 
poor janet was another attorney general who went down for the clintons she was also sworn in as ag under bill clinton and many questioned her appointment at the time according to a report in the chicago tribune  
she arrived in washington from miami as caesars wife and so she has remained she was ignorant and independent of insider dc and has stayed that way bill clinton never much liked her and never confided in her and she reciprocated 
she became ag just in time to take the fall for the debacle in waco  actually according to historycom 
the waco standoff had already begun by the time janet reno became the first female attorney general on march   she approved the fbis tear gas plan the following month explaining that negotiations with the branch davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk we will never know whether there was a better solution reno said in  everyone involved  made their best judgments based on all the information we had nonetheless a republicanled congressional report called her decision premature wrong and highly irresponsible she was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements 
the tribune post continued to discuss renos position as a scapegoat 
every day since she took office  she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to clintonwhitewater fundraising lewinsky china espionage etc clinton cant afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her 
but no such attorney general could have survived the clinton scandals much less survived them with her own reputationand her departmentsintact 
attorney generals who have anything to do with the clintons dont seem to fare too well they end up so embroiled in clinton scandals that they too are pulled down into the mire regardless of what their intentions were when they started out lynch can see her futureand it has something to do with help wanted ads 
the last time lynch was involved in the clinton email kerfuffle she promised to abide by fbi director james comeys recommendation  
i wonder if shell make that same promise this time 
she really cant because if she does it will show she was complicit with the clintons the last time around and also this time when she decried comeys release of information about the investigation 
i wonder if she and hillary clinton will be able to get adjoining cells whenif the truth comes out

No Author,eu finland can help settlement of syria conflict iran parliament speaker,"foreign policy scotlands secretary of state david mundell photo by afp 
scottish secretary of state david mundell has warned about the consequences of the uks withdrawal from the european union eu saying brexit would cut access to the single market 
mundell told members of the scottish parliament on thursday that neither scotland nor any other part of the uk was going to get a special deal during the negotiations with the eu 
so there are very specific issues to specific industries but there wont be special deals and its absolutely wrong to characterize a suggestion that certain areas of the country will get a special deal and scotland will not he said 
i accept on one level if we are leaving the eu then essentially we are leaving the single market but access to the single market can i think continue in a way that doesnt involve tariffs or barriers the secretary continued 
british and scottish officials have long been engaged in a war of words over the brexit process with scotland asking for an equal role in the negotiations 
during an eu referendum on june  scotland voted  percent to  percent to remain in the member bloc but britons voted to leave  percent to  percent 
british prime minister theresa may has made it clear that she will complete the brexit process by  and that scotland holds no veto over it 
scotland in response has threatened to secede from the uk in order to preserve its eu membership which in turn guarantees the nations access to the eu single market 
last year scotlands first attempt for independence from the uk was blocked by voters in a referendum 
mundell told msps that the possibility of a second referendum was already harming scottish businesses even more than brexit 
it is already evident because i understand that the surveyors organization have said there is a drop off in the take up of commercial property in scotland he said 
experts warn that in case of a hard brexit the uk may lose its preferential access to the eus single market and suffer from soured relations with other eu members loading",presstv.ir,Real,english,99.2,47.88118811881188,72,11,2056,355,4.743661971830986,355.0,0.3069974343475224,0.1737735362073249,-0.2441460865782561,-0.2214281709542938,-0.3409352570501582,-0.2150076556072021,0.0028169014084507,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0042537364805452,-0.9777,0.051,0.118,0.831,Negative,Very Strong

the bombshells about this criminal are now breaking daily its not a question of trump it is an imperative that hillary be defeated if the people choose hillary then they must and will be punished wikileaks bill clinton boasts of hillarys working relationship with muslim brotherhood by john hayward breitbart  october   
in a speech bill clinton gave at the home of mehul and hema sanghani in october  revealed to the public for the first time by wikileaks former president bill clinton touted hillary clintons working relationship with the muslim brotherhoods mohamed morsi in egypt as an example of her diplomatic skillspresident clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the iran nuclear deal in a passage that began with the standard democrat stuff happens shrugging defense for foreign policy failures 
finally we live in a world as i said thats full of good news and bad news the united states cannot control it all but we need a president whos most likely to make as many good things happen as possible and most likely to prevent big bad things from happening you cant keep every bad thing from happening whos most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way even the people who dont like the iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadnt been for the sanctions hillary negotiated those sanctions and got china and russia to sign off  something i thought shed never be able to do i confess im never surprised by anything she does but that surprised me i didnt think she could do it the chinese and the russians to see past their shortterm selfinterest to their longterm interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race 
and when the muslim brotherhood took over in egypt in spite of the fact that we were inaudible she developed a working relationship with the thenpresident and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a fullscale shooting war between israel and hamas in gaza which on top of what was going on in syria and the inaudible jordan would have been a calamity for the world 
and when we were trying to reset our relations with russia under president medvedev she and her team negotiated a new start treaty which limits warheads and missiles and she lobbied it through the senate she had to get  votes which means a lot of these republicans who say that they dont like her now are just kidding for election season they trusted her and she got it passed you cant get  votes in the senate without a lot of republican support and i dont know about you but with all this tension and mr putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in syria i think its a very good thing that were in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the russians she did that 
youll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the iran debacle than bill clinton boasting that the sanctions barack obama lifted were superawesome as even those who dont think those sanctions should have been lifted agree 
mr clintons version of the iran sanctions leaves out a few details  such as russias keen financial interest in keeping iranian energy out of the european market and chinas desire to use iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip 
but the part about the muslim brotherhood is most interesting if anything he is selling hillary clintons working relationship with egyptian islamists short because she used american diplomatic leverage for morsis benefit even before he got elected warning egyptians about backtracking to a military regime at a key moment of the postmubarak campaign when morsi was running against a former member of hosni mubaraks military there have long been rumors that more subtle forms of us  pressure  were used to secure morsis office as well 
then again in public pronouncements clinton called hosni mubaraks tottering regime stable and cautioned her obama administration colleagues against pushing a longtime partner out the door 
a few days ago declassified state department documents revealed clintons talking points for a  meeting with morsi hailed his election as a milestone in egypts transition to democracy and stated that she was to offer the muslim brotherhood leader technical expertise and assistance from both the us government and private sector to support his economic and social programs 
clinton was also supposed to privately offer morsi assistance with his police and security forces which would be conducted quite discreetly 
after morsi was gone she declared herself exasperated with egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical realist that is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the obama administration was saying while the arab spring was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but americaaligned or at least americafearing regimes which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long 
as for clintons superb working relationship with morsi that eventually ended with morsis wife railing against clinton for supposedly dismissing him as a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency and threatening to publish letters from clinton to morsi that would damage the former us secretary of state meanwhile mohammed morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the egyptian penitentiary system  
egypt has one of those icky military governments again and while it wont have fond memories of hillary clintons support for the muslim brotherhood regime it will most likely work with whoever wins the  us presidential election therefore a prospective president hillary clinton probably wont suffer too much from secretary of state hillary clintons appalling lapses in judgment

admin,republicans in congress are ready for hillary as they prepare for new probes into clinton foundation,"how population growth industrial agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society how population growth industrial agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society 
a determined young man with a strong sense of his destiny  to save his country from postmodern collapse october   culture 
the global population in  was about one billion people today it stands at over seven times that amount with the rapidly growing populations of india and africa expected to increase that to at least nine billion over the coming years readers today are well used to the idea that the global south is densely populated relative to its economic size and area but this was not always the case prior to the collapse of empire europe having undergone thorough industrialization was the most densely populated continent in the world source the world at six billion united nations   un dept of economic and social affairs population division  
europe was also where the worlds social justice movementsliberalism communism and feminismbegan overthrowing the old order of kings castes and courtship with the vulgar and degenerate world we suffer today but why did this happen why did the immense increase of wealth and prosperity not correspond to an increase of human happiness but instead lead to the emasculation of men the breakdown of the family and the disappearance of religion and morality 
in these series of articles i examine the root causes of this paradox what one can do about it on an individual dietary level and what one can do about it on an individual environmental level i am a strong believer in social change through individual growth and having experienced a dramatic turnaround in the quality of my own personality and success of my outcomes as a result of following these strategies i hope that others can benefit from my knowledge and similarly make themselves into solid men popular mainstream theories for social degeneration 
many authors have postulated economic reasons for this degenerationindustrialization having deprived men of their primary roles as the masters of nature reduced their worth and attractivenessor utilityin the eyes of women relatedly others argue that technological progress which increased independence and ability for all allowed women to go their own way 
another popular argument is that increased prosperity leads to reduced incentive for disciplinerselection versus kselectionand so prosperous disciplined societies create a generation of lazy youngsters fat off the success of their parents who cause so much havoc with their short sighted policies that their civilization collapses leading to a new generation of disciplined youngsters who again create greatness one example of a shortsighted policy would be the feminist political movement which artificially separated woman from man by giving her through affirmative action socially harmful economic independence 
while all these explanations bear some truth none of them delve into the deeply emotional spiritual human and thus fundamentally biological causes of social degeneration why the mainstream theories are flawed 
to begin with a healthy man and a healthy woman even with modern technology at their disposal should not so substantially less love and cherish each other as seems to be the case today the proof of this can be seen by examining what it is women do with that technology a modern loose woman uses technology to go to places where men can ravish her even if it gives woman the ability to go it alone technology does not diminish her emotional and biological need for man 
further the availability of technology does not always translate into its adoptionthe failure of google glass is the emblematic example it does not have to be the case that smartphones are automatically adopted for slut culturethey do not have to automatically lead to female promiscuity anyone familiar with russian or japanese women who have the same technology at hand but a vastly greater sense of restraint and selfworth can attest to this fact therefore the technological argument is not sufficient to explain modern degeneracy although it is certainly a necessary condition credit ninaras credit moguphotos 
to briefly examine the argument that men no longer have nonfinancial utility in the eyes of women a man is not necessarily attractive to a woman if he actually breaks rocks or actually kills other peopleinstead being able to is sufficient 
therefore the emotional and spiritual inseparability of a healthy woman from her evolved master man remains and will remain eternally true the change in technology and the nature of mens work is not the causal factorinstead the change in preferences of both men and women explains modern degeneracy men hardly today want to lead and possess their woman and women do not respond to weakling men 
let us examine the rk selection argument if it were the case that wealth and ease begat indiscipline automatically it would be true that the rich produce weak and undisciplined progeny this may seem like a truism today viewed through the lens of the postindustrial overpopulated paris hilton west but in societies of the past it was certainly not the caserather historically the opposite has been true the weak were poor because they were undisciplined and the strong were rich because they were disciplined the poor raised weak and hence undisciplined children while the rich raised strong and disciplined ones so the cycle continued and over time aristocracies formed 
an extreme version of this disciplinedrich mentality can be seen in modern british farmers many of whom financially wealthy and prosperous drive old beaten suvs reuse clothes and generally minimize expenditures while it cannot be denied that even the modern rich have in general become mostly degenerate this is in my opinion a disproportionately visible symptom of a deeper malaise that affects society across the board 
therefore i do not rely on the technological or economic explanations for societal degenerationi view these theories as descriptive of passing symptoms or trends and not timelessly causal truthsint the population growth nutritional depletion and environmental pollution theory of societal degeneration 
having outlined and accounted for the above theories i argue instead that the degeneration of society is caused mostly by the biological degeneration of the human being that makes up the society this degeneration is caused by factors that affect the human organism on the basest level and the two primary factors are nutritional depletion of food caused by the growth of industrial agriculture which itself is made necessary by unprecedented population growth the pollution of the environment caused by industry and the introduction of unsafe technology 
according to this view it was not the boomers access to ease that made them such degenerate and irresponsible scum but rather the fact that the rapid population increase during their key developmental years meant that the growth of industrial agriculture that somewhat necessarily accompanied itthe green revolutioncreated such nutritionally sparse food that there was insufficient development of boomers brains leading to a generation of overgrown children 
further according to this theory the increased dependence on technology is not viewed as the cause of millennial autism but rather a symptom of millennial autism recent historical examples 
consider the historical path of communism which did not generally spring up in the villages this was not because the landlords were better able to control the peasants but instead because poor city dwellers even if earning a higher income than poor peasants had access to much worse food and lived in a far dirtier environment making them both mentally and physically ill the unfortunate result of insufficient mental development in a crisis situation  our aim should be to save as many leftists as possible and almost all can be 
the poor in the countryside today continue to vote conservative or liberal while the urban poor vote socialist for this same reason the rural poor despite usually being less wealthy than the urban poor are intellectually mature enough to see how harmful a controlling government can be the urban poor mostly achieve the intellectual maturity of children or adolescents and mostly feel rather than think so they support an emotionbased class war or gender war ideology 
this theory explains the early rise of social justice in europe where industrial agriculture was first adopted on a wide scale and also explains why such movements did not organically grow anywhere else until much later owing to the much later adoption of industrial agriculture it should be noted that in the countries where communist revolutions were actually successful they enjoyed no broad support but instead were able to defeat the mostly preindustrial historical governments because of these governments economic weakness and also because of extensive support by globalist or communist interests this was true in russia china and cambodia ancient historical examples 
this theory also explains the path of historical civilizationsromes case is highly instructive at its birth rome was a small collection of largely selfsufficient highly disciplined towns where the diet like in many towns of that era was a mixture of grains vegetables small farmed meats like chickens and hunted meatswhat we would call a balanced diet in this society men were the masters of their households with power of life and death over their family members while facing total responsibility for their family members behaviour only a group of strong capable and selfdisciplined individuals could sustain such a social order population of the city of rome e   million inhabitants  source wwwdavidgalbraithorg 
romes extreme martial and social discipline led to expansion as it expanded and the citys population grew the diet for most people changed over time to mostly grains farmed highly intensively shipped in from all over the empire losing a lot of its nutrition on the way simultaneously and partly as a result of rising grain production meat consumption fell reducing the populations testosterone levels leading to falling strength and willingness or ability to compete as well as rising mental illness because of copper overload 
the weakened populations increasing demands for emotion based socialism led to the growth of a massive welfare state and eventual bankruptcy hyperinflation and collapse of the central government 
india is another equally tragic example the population growth that resulted from highly prosperous nanda rule led to the growth of buddhism and the adoption of degenerate attitudes moral collapse and eventually weakness to invasion after the institutionalization of buddhism by powerhungry and utterly machiavellian psychopath ashokawho looked to weaken the brahmins hinduisms traditional moral guidesbuddhisms degenerate vegetarian curse spread like a virus and created over several generations a population of weaklings who werent again able to assert their independence for over a thousand years the song dynasty followed a similar path as these two empires being eventually overrun by the mongols the yuan dynasty population of china  source vaclab smil chinas environmental crisis  
this degradation of the diet caused by population growth has been at least a significant causal element behind the degeneracy and collapse of most prosperous sedentary civilizations the modern context 
the dramatic increase of the population since ancient times should help you understand why humans today are such fools and weaklings compared to our ancestors there is only so much nutrition in the worlds topsoil to go around and a population seven times greater than  years ago eating a diet uncorrected through nutritional supplementation for dietary sparsity will be living individually in effect  th the life that its ancestor population did is it any wonder that people today feel so weak and helpless that they want mommy government and daddy police state to give them the illusion of comfort and security 
this theory is also borne out in the data in general food today contains ½ to  th the nutrients it did in the s which was already about  years after the adoption of modern style industrial agriculture in the west this dramatic fall in nutrition has accompanied the tripling of the global population and closeto doubling of the european population since that time while some population control seems necessary i believe that sustainable organic agriculture combined with nutritional supplementation should obviate a large amount of needed population reduction 
i hope that the reader is after consideration of these facts sufficiently convinced of the true causes behind the modern worlds degeneracy people have fairly universally across the political spectrum become weak and insane from malnutrition artificial protein may have allowed some men to grow muscles and calcium from an overreliance on milk may have allowed them to grow tall but perhaps the lack of most necessary nutrients has meant that they are generally still retarded emotionally spiritually and intellectually the effects on modern society 
this weakness amongst menand dietary sparsity has disproportionately affected men due to our much greater nutritional requirementshas not just resulted in an inability to control the destructive forces that lie latent in every society worse the fundamental outlook of men who viewed themselves as the creators of civilization the slayers of enemies and the protectors of women all under god has changed the modern millennial man is a childlike hedonist who cares little for his civilization culture or people an aspiring patriarch an example of testicular failure image credit giorgiomtbshutterstock environmental toxins 
environmental toxins are also a problem electrical oestrogen and toxic metal pollution are underresearched but may have devastating effects on human health radio waves plastics unfiltered medication and purposely added toxins in the water supply like fluoride and chlorine have deleterious effects too what can we do 
considering these realities it serves little purpose to blame women for their selfdestructive behavior while in the past like men women used to have enough emotional maturity to try to live a life of selfrespect for example by remaining virgins and not drinking alcohol they have never had much agency charisma or true self will even before the diet was empty and before they were being stuffed full of drugs and chemicals by the unscrupulous pharmaceutical industry and its proxies 
these poisons may cause serious and dangerous although slowly fixable hormonal and behavioral changes but the real effects are felt by their offspring unfortunately once a woman is hooked on these drugs for example the birth control pill or antidepressants she is unlikely to come off them and if she does she is unlikely to do anything to fix the damage to herself or her future children this is especially the case as the medical industry which has brainwashed her to see doctors and the state as her loving protectors is unlikely to recommend it 
even so these drugs dont permanently alter the fact that women as mostly emotion driven actors are biologically and intrinsically people pleasers and respond automatically to the most powerful person or group of people that can give them a raison dêtre even if we cant ensure that women in general improve their diet and avoid pollutants we can certainly make changes on an individual level convincing or browbeating our girlfriends sisters and mothers 
the healthier a woman gets the greater her affinity with nature becomes and the more maternal she feels so you can be fairly certain that shell try and pass on the knowledge to her children and friends like our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers did furthermore there are a large minority of health conscious women who it should be our duty to marry and impregnate as many times as possible considering the rapid population declines that will occur in the atheist and leftist segments of our countries native populations these women are our best hope for creating a viable future you will have to teach her a few things credit csp_subbotina the situation is not hopelessbut we have a fight on our hands 
in the past wellinformed people couldnt expect due to the limited and elitecontrolled nature of communication technology and the educational system to make any impact on the vast majority of the population the political fight against big agra and big pharma seemed hopeless today is different the growth of the internet and the increasing spread of awareness has meant that more people are aware about the importance of eating well avoiding environmental dangers and supplementing wisely 
this is partly evidenced by the steadily rising percentage of people who eat organic diets and the booming supplement industry i hope that in the future at least a significant portion of us can survive in a sane enough state to politically fight back against moves by globalists islamists communists and ruthless financiers who are circling like vultures over our degenerating civilizations 
on the other side of this political battle the globalist controlled medical industry has been the biggest proponent of unhealthy diets and dangerous and addictive drugs special interests have also been the biggest corrupters of regulators and the institutions created to defend the population against industrial and chemical pollution 
a system of global monopoly wealth extraction is not possible with active capable and selfconfident masculinities from proud nationstates to resist it those who seek to benefit from such a monopoly system have tried their absolute hardest to suppress natural health information but so far they have failed and the situation is only improving so there is considerable reason for hope conclusion 
our forefathers demanded to fulfill their destiny ordained by the gods to defend our civilizations against the forces of rapacious greed and murderous atheistic villainyto be the protectors and kings of our people today most men are mentally ill and have become childish hedonistic narcissists as expected the ruthless and soulless have exploited this weakness for their own benefit now that you have i hope understood the principles behind why most of us have lost the urge to fight to protect our cultures the cause and fix to the industrial malaise should no longer seem out of reach or impossible to grasp 
this area of the human condition is just one another where we stand at the crossroads of history but in my opinion it is the most important if the dietary trend of the last two centuries is not reversed and the nutritional quality of at least a significant minority of men is not substantially improved then each generation of people will become more communist more feminist and more weak than the last and the globalist special interests that seek to create a totalitarian worldmonopoly police state will win regardless of temporary political victories 
each of us has chosen a path to follow in our quest for spiritual intellectual and national salvation this is mine in my future articles i will detail the best dietary approach for strong men and beautiful women to follow and overview the most important environmental precautions we must take in our quest to fix the root causes of modern degeneracy

whereas trump rallies are packed with hopefilled beaming faces a clintonwarren affair is festooned with malevolentlooking aggrieved women and their frightened lowt houseboys the background music enfeebled squeaking courtesy of a female pop singer like katy perry whose outoftune yelps and bedroom whispers would be unheard if not for the marvel of autotune autotune is the holy grail of recording that corrects intonation problems in vocals or solo instruments in real time without distortion or artifacts it was invented by a male engineer

Mike Dan,eight tips to a deeper and more relaxing sleep,"keywords acupuncture  baby eczema  cure baby eczema  eczema cure  eczema treatment  heal eczema 
there was a time when my sons eczema became so severe i was willing to try any natural healing method my baby was  months old when he developed eczema we tried the usual dose of steroids and overthecounter creams from our family doctor it got so bad that his scars were not healing he wasnt sleeping and i wasnt sleeping as a child my mother took me to an acupuncturist for migraines and the migraines stopped after a handful of visits i remember it being a pretty relaxing experience with the smell of incense and herbs and the quietness of the room so i took a leap of faith and booked us for an appointment with a traditional chinese doctor who specialized in skin disorders allergies and asthma why try acupuncture  traditional chinese medicine reason  acupuncture has been practiced for almost  years in china 
with that much history its worth a try it is a method of relieving pain or curing an illness by placing needles in the patients body at precise points along the  meridians in the body meridians are energy pathways that are associated with different organs within the body the world health organization lists  ailments that are treatable by chinese medicine  acupuncture reason  acupuncture has helped children with eczema 
in a study of  children who were treated with chinese medicinal herbs the treatment reduced eczema symptoms by  in  of the children see sources although it was a small study size the benefits seem to far outweigh the risks when my son was a baby even a  improvement in his symptoms would have been amazing for us reason  acupuncture does not hurt babies 
many people worry about the needles hurting but the needles that acupuncturists use are about  th of a syringe needle my son was a baby when we started the treatments and he never cried out when getting the needles in him reason  acupuncture relieved my babys eczema by  
acupuncture healed the eczema to the point where we could figure out his triggers our doctor stabilized the eczema best of all flareups only occurred when my baby was teething his skin was softer than it had been in months acupuncture needs to be done on babies for a minimum of  months in order to see an improvement this is because the treatment is trying to alter the immune response which is a long process but sometimes babies will respond quicker than that we used a topical herb powder given to us by the doctor and applied it to his skin this topical mix had a similar effect as hydrocortisone cream if i applied it  times per day with a cotton ball reason  acupuncture is affordable 
this is true especially if you go to a student clinic you can pay the affordable price and yet the students are supervised by very experienced doctors for child and baby treatments it is even more affordable it cost us about  per visit on average we tried a few different clinics some health plans will cover acupuncture so check with your health plan to see if yours covers it to keep it affordable i suggest trying to find a specialist in acupuncture  tcm traditional chinese medicine not a practitioner who does many different types of treatments tips for helping your child while getting acupuncture 
bring a favorite stuffed animal a book or some toys try nursing your baby while they are receiving acupuncture a baby only needs the needle in the acupressure point for a second and then they are pulled out adults typically have needles in for  minutes for each treatment because our bodies do not respond as quickly as babies bodies do check out my youtube video for more tips find an experienced  accredited acupuncturist 
make sure to look for an accredited acupuncturist or tcm traditional chinese medicine doctor be sure the acupuncturist has some experience in your condition chat with the people in the waiting room and see if theyve had success with your doctor i met a few moms in the waiting room that swore by the chinese doctor we were going to see that made me feel more comfortable 
find a tcm traditional chinese medicine doctor who offers certified organic chinese herbs certified organic means the herbs were never sprayed with toxic pesticides and herbicides as well there have been some reports of heavy metals residue in chinese herbs herbs are just as powerful as prescription medications and can have adverse effects if used improperly make sure to ask about the testing done on the herbs that you or your baby are prescribed every condition has different treatment needs 
check with your family doctor to be sure you dont have any conditions that would prevent you from using acupuncture or chinese medicine all the information in this article is provided for educational and informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for medical counseling

No Author,americans seek to help persecuted christians government helps muslims  frontpage magazine,"hillary clinton and the presidents  longer game  at home and abroad a nation less affluent less free and far less secure october   lloyd billingsley 
the president of the united states the most powerful man in the world used a pseudonym to communicate with secretary of state hillary clinton on her private unsecured email server as andrew mccarthy contended  that was the reason the fbi declined to prosecute clinton because the president would have been part of the same action and that wouldnt be politically correct 
the current president of the united states is also on record that contrary to custom he will linger in washington dc for a few years wherever he chooses to live the email intrigue suggests continuing backchannel communications with hillary clinton should she become president that invites a look at what the man the new york times dubbed obamas narrator the white house adviser who sat closest to the president and signed off on his every word had to say about the presidents vision of the future 
few of the decisions he had made would satisfy the politics of the moment david axelrod explained in his massive  believer  but at home and abroad obama was playing a longer game as he explained in columbia missouri on october   we are five days away from fundamentally transforming the united states of america 
if this man was a liberal as barry rubin wondered in silent revolution how the left rose to political power and cultural dominance  why did he see a need fundamentally to transform a nation shaped by liberals such as franklin roosevelt with his new deal and lyndon johnson with his great society he saw the need because he was not a liberal but a lifelong leftist radical 
as david horowitz explained in volume  of the black book of the american left  the president was born bred and trained in the progressive movement his mentors were communists and their progressive successors so no wonder he presided over the institutionalizing of the policies of the left in government for eight years what that means in practical terms is becoming painfully evident 
the economy remains sluggish and under obamacare the presidents signature plan premiums are skyrocketing  this suggests that as many believe obamacare was simply a demolition plan in the longer game designated successor hillary clinton will impose government monopoly healthcare what some candidates erroneously call socialized medicine 
as rubin noted the goal of the left is to convince americans the exact opposite of what their experience proved that the country had fundamentally failed and the old leftist solutions were the answer the result may be a very longterm and even permanent change of the united states into something else a nation far less affluent and far less free and far less secure as david axelrod also indicates 
vladimir putin makes an appearance in believer but obamas narrator does not outline putins background in the kgb the believer includes nothing about putins role in east germany a stalinist police state that walled in its subjects and shot those attempting to escape the narrator avoids putins belief that the breakup of the soviet union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century 
in believer  putin tells the president you are a highly educated man i come from the security sector the believer then asks the president for his assessment of putin 
hes smart tough clear about his interests and without a trace of sentimentality the president says that is not very strong language for a kgb veteran and expansionist autocrat

Jason Easley,moronic trump campaign thinks reopened clinton email investigation will save them,"by sean colarossi on mon oct st  at  pm cnn has obtained audio of north carolina gop senator richard burr joking about gun owners putting a bullseye on hillary clinton share on twitter print this post 
cnn has obtained brand new audio of north carolina republican senator richard burr joking about gun owners putting a bullseye on hillary clinton 
the despicable comments come as burr faces a close senate race against democratic opponent deborah ross both candidates are within a point of each other according to realclearpolitics 
more of the cnn report  
the north carolina republican locked in a tight race for reelection quipped that as he walked into a gun shop nothing made me feel better than seeing a magazine about rifles with a picture of hillary clinton on the front of it 
i was a little bit shocked at that  it didnt have a bullseye on it he said saturday to gop volunteers prompting laughter from the crowd in mooresville north carolina but on the bottom right of the magazine it had everybody for federal office in this particular state that they should vote for so let me assure you theres an army of support out there right now for our candidates 
this type of rhetoric is hardly uncommon when it comes to republican leaders in  as the campaign has gone on the hateful and violent rhetoric particularly from the man at the top of the republican ticket has become increasingly worse 
at one point this year donald trump suggested that second amendment people should take up arms against clinton if she nominates a supreme court justices they dont like he also said that hed like to see what happens if the democratic nominees bodyguards were disarmed 
as cnn notes trump has never issued a genuine apology for his dangerous language  or anything hes ever said or done  but burr quickly came out with a statement once the audio was revealed although it does not excuse what he said 
the comment i made was inappropriate and i apologize for it the republican senator said according to cnn 
this type of imagery has no place in our politics regardless of whether its being said in public or private especially given the heightened level of anger and hatred toward hillary clinton from trump supporters

KD7ONE,no title,"return of kings has a great variety of information about many subjects improving your social life  health and fitness  tourism  among several others still our political perspectives might be offputting to some readers on the left although you could tune out whatever you dont agree with you might do well to take a closer look not all of us agree on everything but we do have a rough consensus on some items
our views on the political establishment the left blames corporations while the right blames the government when in reality the two interests work together to subvert the will of the people
its pretty easy to see that this site has a mainly conservative perspective especially on social matters not all of us started out that way many of us began our journey away from the political orthodoxy after realizing what a mess feminism has made of society others have been turned off by political correctness once upon a time i used to be liberal and i know im not the only one be that as it may some of us are actually friendly to liberalism 
by the way we dont give a free pass to the mainstream conservative establishment either unfortunately the government in countless ways seeks to amass power for itself while producing fear and dependency in the populace really its not a democrat problem or republican problem theyre basically two sides of the same coin heads they win tails you lose
surely youre in favor of progress one good question though is what exactly this constitutes  also who gets to define what is progress all that might seem rhetorical but these are important matters likely you see change as a good thing but whos setting the agenda deciding which direction that change goes actually we have answers for all that
in fact we might have some more in common with you than you expect dont care for agribusiness neither do we  are you troubled by the influence of the ultrawealthy in the political process we are too  do you suspect that the powerful have set up a system of managed democracy where theyre pulling the purse strings of both the republicans and the democrats if you supported bernie sanders youve probably figured that one out already we understand you
todays political and social scene 
you might be disenchanted by some of the things going on with the democratic party today perhaps youve heard of their hypocrisy and contempt for the public  are you troubled by some of the clinton scandals maybe even wondered if there was more to it than you expected 
perhaps your questioning goes deeper you might wonder who hijacked liberalism  it once stood for helping the working man but some time in the s it turned into so much squabbling divisiveness actually theres a reason for that  the culture war began long before the s that wasnt about liberation but rather a deliberate attempt to spread divisiveness and weaken the fabric of society
also taxpayers have spent untold money on social programs but why dont they solve problems instead they create intergenerational poverty you might be shocked to learn that encouraging dependency along with taxing and spending to oblivion was actually a stratagem meant to crash the system  thats not about helping the disadvantaged its about using them schemes like thesecausing societal upheaval so a socialist paradise will magically fall into placeare pretty reckless
you might shake your head in bewilderment at online mobs of misguided youths spewing bile about things that dont really matter sure youre against police brutality as am i but deep down you also fear what will come of all this open contempt for the law and violence against police  the authorities take a pretty dim view of cop killers kind of sounds like someone behind the scenes wants to start a lot of trouble doesnt it
finally you might wonder if the people on top of the liberal establishment really give a damn about the common people we think its rotten that theyre using so many wellmeaning people for the cynical ends of amassing money and power
likely you have some nagging concerns about whats going on in society today why are women both liberated and spoiled  and sometimes even hostile cant the feminists see that things arent really so bad  sure youre all about tolerance and have lots of gay friends but you privately wonder if there should be sensible limits  you might be uncomfortable with all the evangelizing of alternative lifestyles especially if you have children in school
you consider the press to be the bedrock of a free society but you have doubts about journalistic integrity  hey we understand the propaganda is everywhere even in shows for young children  the media has been feeding you bullshit all your life and we think their lying is rotten you deserve better than that
starting to reconsider 
a diehard social justice warrior will seethe with rage for me bringing up these uncomfortable facts even if youre a moderate you might be reluctant to consider any of this we understand rethinking deeply held beliefs is a painful process for so many things youll see that what youve been told is right is actually wrong and what is wrong is really right
many on the left have been there before and found their way out for me someone explained that im not responsible for the worlds problems its not your fault the endless attempts in college to ram opinions down my throat hardened my resolve others whove made the journey have different stories some got religion others realized that their past fanaticism has hurt others  some wondered why decades of costly social programs havent accomplished anything some came to see that preferential treatment in hiring decisions is anything but fairness
its in your best interests to purge the misconceptions and guilt trips from your mind still you dont have to abandon everything and embrace the polar opposite some have reached a synthesis position 
welcome to the other side 
if youve read this far with an open mindand checked out some of the referenced articlesthen you might be confused perhaps youre tempted to reject our message on the other hand you might be shocked and even angry about whats been going on in politics and society
we understand enlightenment is a painful process were here for you the truth hurts but well do the best we can to tell it like it is which is much more than can be said for what youll see on television ive merely scratched the surface here stick with us and youll see how deep the rabbit hole goes

Dr. Patrick Slattery,clinton policy on syria would lead to ww iii trump,"clintons nofly zone over syria will lead to war with russia warning of jcs chairman general dunford october   at  am global research  october   the media has failed to address the confrontation between the us state department and the joint chiefs of staff 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford image right has warned both the us senate as well secretary of state john kerry in no uncertain terms that a no fly zone over syria would lead to war with both syria and russia intimating a dangerous process of military escalation 
in a senate arms services committee hearing dunford said responding to questions from republican senator roger whicker mississippi 
right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make  senate armed services committee september   emphasis added 
at the third presidential debate hillary clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president she would implement a noflyzone intimating that the objective was to save lives 
i think a nofly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict i am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general clinton said in response to a question from fox news debate moderator chris wallace 
this would not be done just on the first day this would take a lot of negotiation and would also take making it clear to the russians and syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground  i think we could strike a deal and make it clear to the russians and the syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interest of the people on the ground in syria fox news emphasis added 
at present under the obama administration the joint chiefs of staff are opposed to the no fly zone 
the joint chiefs of staff are appointed by the secretary of defense 
under a clinton presidency a new secretary of defense as well as a new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff firmly committed to a no fly zone over syria would be appointed 
michèle angelique flournoy a former under secretary of defense for policy is hillarys choice for the position of secretary of defense who favors the no fly zone option 
according to defense one the woman expected to run the pentagon under hillary clinton said she would direct us troops to push president bashar alassads forces out of southern syria and would send more american boots to fight the islamic state in the region 
confirmed by the leaked emails michele flournoy is a crony of the clintons she has called for limited military coercion to help remove assad from power in syria including a no bombing zone over parts of syria held by usbacked rebels this is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including isis daesh from actions by syrian and russian forces 
according to defense one flournoy and several of her colleagues at the center for new american security or cnas have been making the case for sending more american troops into combat against isis and the assad regime than the obama administration has been willing to commit
since russias increased involvement the facts on the ground in syria she said do not support the kind of negotiated conditions we would like to get to us policy should be the removal of assad even if that meant using limited military coercion flournoy said at mondays annual cnas conference in washington 
flournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased us intervention for instance she acknowledged her support for us strikes using standoff weapons  to retaliate against syrian military targets to enforce the nobomb zone 
the press reports however did not quote the details of the discussion and testimony of general dunford and secretary of defense carter at the arms services committee hearing let me see if the chairman wants to add anything
senator wicker well let me just ask this if you dont mind secretary carter it would help if the barrel bombing ended and i spoke to a democratic colleague of mine today ive been calling for a nofly zone to stop the barrel bombing and i asked this colleague of mine on the other side of the aisle if he would support that and he said yes he said i want to call it something else rather than a nofly zone but that this particular senator it is a fact that this particular senator has now changed his position and would like us to take action to present  to prevent the barrel bombing 
what is your position about that and wouldnt it help if we took decisive action and ended this carnage 
secretary carter i dont know the specific proposal which youre discussing with your colleague ill make one comment and see if the chairman wants to add anything 
senator wicker i think he was talking about a nofly zone  
secretary carter well okay 
senator wicker  but described in more palatable terms 
secretary carter there are  a number of different proposals have been made but i  the one that i think it the focus on right now is the one secretary kerrys trying to promote namely a nofly zone for the russians and the syrians who are attacking the syrian people if theyre talking about a nofly zone for american aircraft fighting isil needless to say that  thats not going to get any enthusiasm get strong opposition from me 
senator wicker im speaking about a  
secretary carter but i think thats what a  but  its not called that but secretary kerry is trying to get a standdown of the syrian and russian air force and if hes successful that would be a good thing 
let me ask the chairman if he has anything to add 
general dunford senator the only thing id say is you know as the situation on the ground changes i think i have a responsibility  we the joint force has a responsibility  to make sure the president has a full range of options we have discussed that issue in the past under certain conditions the conditions on the ground will change and well continue to look at those options and make sure theyre available to the president 
senator wicker what about the option of controlling the airspace so that barrel bombs cannot be dropped 
general dunford all options  
senator wicker what do you think of that option sir 
general dunford right now senator for all of the airspace in syria it would require war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make 

concluding remarks 
from the above testimonies and statements one thing is clear decisionmakers at highest levels of the us government and the military believe in their own propaganda they are not able to reflect on their actions outside the realm of propaganda and this also applies to nuclear warfare which is presented as a peacemaking operation 
it is unlikely that any drastic action regarding a no fly zone will be taken under the obama administration prior to the november elections and the instatement of a new president of the us in january  
consequently the next three months will be absolutely crucial for syria ie during this period the counterterrorism campaign waged by syria with the support of russia and iran will seek to eliminate remaining terrorist pockets and pacify the entire country 
the footsoldiers of the western military alliance will be defeated on the ground if this objective is achieved it will inevitably have an impact on us options regarding the proposed deployment of groundforces and the no fly zone what prevails however is an attempt on the part of washington to redeploy its isis terrorist footsoldiers in mosul by transferring them from iraq to syria the original source of this article is global research",davidduke.com,Real,english,94.81395100814586,87.55704798984418,50,10,7747,1345,4.716728624535316,1345.0,-0.3656534312002963,-0.0141271790859303,1.2615312846504565,1.3305758112088673,-0.3675158294600579,1.3732815708500707,0.0014869888475836,0.0,0.0007434944237918,0,0,0.0,0.0024392855189648,0.9358,0.089,0.073,0.838,Positive,Very Strong

"L.J.

donald trumps message that everything in the us is crap and we are all drowning in economic hardship that only trump can fix got slapped down today as the us economy roars back 
the advance estimate of gdp for the third quarter of  showed that the obama economy grew at an annual rate of  the conservative wall street journal headlined this news with us economy roars back grew  in third quarter 
jason furman chairman of the council of economic advisers summarized the numbers real gdp grew  percent at an annual rate in the third quarter with strong export growth and continued strength in consumer spending 
this news flies in the face of donald trumps basic economic message of doom and gloom that only he can fix the trump economic plan creates at least  million jobs boosts growth up to  percent and is revenue neutral trumps website claims 
before these numbers trumps previous problem was that trumps economic plan is a big giveaway to the top one percent isnt revenue neutral and would destroy  million jobs trump also struggled with analysis that his plan could hurt the economy in the long run 
the conservativeleaning tax foundation found that trumps plan would cost the us trillions of dollars and grow the incomes of the top one percent by  trumps tax plan could cost the us  million jobs 
according to a report released at the end of july by moodys analytics hillary clintons economic proposals would create millions of jobs and boost economic growth higher than current projections the analysis shows that if implemented the democratic nominees agenda would create  million jobs and accelerate economic growth to an annual average of  percent 
under trumps plan moodys estimated that unemployment would spike to  percent and over  million americans would be put out of work the us economy will weaken significantly if mr trumps economic policies are fully implemented as he has proposed the june report said the economy will suffer a recession that begins in early  and extends into even longer than the great recession 
yikes 
trump sells these plans with a broadly negative message that often strays from facts trump earned a pants on fire from politifact for this claim made june th  in his presidential announcement speech the last quarter it was just announced our gross domestic product  was below zero who ever heard of this its never below zero 
but also they note finally since trump was attacking obama for this bad quarter of growth well just throw this out of the  quarters of negative growth since world war ii  occurred under republican presidents and just  under democratic presidents 
todays new economic numbers help clinton make the argument that people should vote for her if they want to continue the record setting job growth numbers and economic growth under president obama 
hillary for america senior policy advisor jacob leibenluft pounced on the numbers to say todays gdp release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years but hillary clinton believes there is still more we need to do to build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top independent experts agree her plan would create goodpaying jobs through investments in infrastructure innovation and education 
the economy is roaring back under president obama and the numbers suggest that it does better under a democratic president donald trump keeps saying clinton is  more years of obama which makes a sunny case for her

Quintus Curtius,what françois de la rochefoucauld has to teach us about cynicism,"its now been over a week since the most glorious victory ever recorded in the war against rapacious globalism and lunatic cultural marxismthe election of donald trump to the presidency of the united states like many of you i was outside with my fellow tribesmen  the same tribe our opponents tried to shut down in february  until about  am on election day as you may expect it was a joyous occasion that ill never forget

yet as i remarked at the time while this was a glorious victory a decisive one that ended the campaign the war would continue i had hoped to be as magnanimous as possible in victory to finally bridge some divides and begin to move past the insanity weve been dealing with thats accelerated in the past few years however as has quickly become apparent the cultural marxists sjws and their globalist overlords have no intention of coming to terms or engaging in meaningful selfreflection anytime soon instead theyre doubling down on everything that voters resoundingly rejected on november th
predictably there have been protests and some riots incidents of violence on the left have taken place and gone underreported just as predictably most of these protests are professionally organized  with george soros likely pulling at least a few of the strings learning nothing the regressive leftists taking to the streets complete with their year zero pathology think themselves morally justified in blocking streets and attacking people because theyre on a mission to purify society anything that stands in the way of that mission can be justly eliminated 
i came across one of these protests a few days ago it was generic and small basic bitch shit really but recall that these are merely the peons in the army of their overlords their intensity will dissipate with time the safetypin wearing safespace occupying neonhaired freaks arent the ones to take note of on the grand strategic map the bigger picture to focus on is the drive toward increased censorship in the past few days
the recent counteroffensive began with the uproar over donald trumps selection of steve bannon to be his chief white house strategist the media and its acolytes on social media went into another coordinated attack lambasting bannon and breitbart  which he ran as having connections to the altright which in turn they say is associated with white nationalism to reinforce this pairing the media ran with a couple of the most controversial breitbart headlines
if you recognize this tactic its because the media ab tested this against roosh in february they took the  how to stop rape  headline said that it proved that roosh was prorape and then repeated endlessly
this is actually a sort of hypnosis trick and was certainly done deliberately scott adams calls this wordthinking 
rational people use data and reason to arrive at truth this group is mostly imaginary
wordthinkers use labels word definitions and analogies to create the illusion of rational thinking this group is  of the world
persuaders use simplicity repetition emotion habit aspirations visual communication and other tools of persuasion to program other people and themselves this group is about  of the population and effectively control the wordthinkers of the world
he further describes the phenomenon of wordthinking 
wordthinking is important to persuasion because if you can convince someone to accept a label on an opponent it turns off their critical thought and turns on their confirmation bias nuance is lost context is lost all that matters once the label is accepted is whatever qualities the label already contained
and this is what the media is doing they did it with roosh and are now doing their damndest to do it to bannon no doubt as one of the thousand paper cuts they hope to use to take president trump down
because the term altright is relatively fresh its vulnerable to being defined with the most ominous dark terms possible which is why the media is trying furiously to create as much connective tissue between it and white nationalism as possible remember with wordthinking nuance and context are lost
and now that this first step has been achieved where it was meant to the selfanointed moral cover for the more alarming stage of the counteroffensive is underway now that the ambiguous and ominoussounding altright has been attempted to be extensively defined the solution is obviously to crack down on it and anyone having to do with it even if they really dont given this pretext the purges and censorship have begun with numerous prominent twitter accounts being suspended agree with these accounts or not i often dont it should give you pause that this kind of blanket censorship is being implemented if youre just a little bit politically unorthodox youre now at heightened risk of being slapped with the altright label even if youre on record as not identifying with it and banned from outlets of communication that are both vital for pushing your ideas forward and for promoting any business you have
but banning individuals is only stage one stage two is the recent drive by google facebook twitter and others to censor what they call fake news the media has been on a blitz against these fake news articles completely unironically given that this is the same crowd that uncritically signal boosted the rolling stone rape hoax to the ends of the world fact checks donald trumps comment that hillary clinton acid washed her private email server selectively edits clips to promote the narrative that their pets in black lives matter are entirely peaceful when they arent  and fails to disclose contacts and relationships with officials of the democratic national committee while writing about the campaign
no this is not the onion
while this drive deserves to be a subject of laughter we must nevertheless still take it seriously there have already been reports of shadow bans on twitter with prominent figures such as mike cernovich and scott adams and its far from out of the question that a blacklist of sorts gets put up for outlets such as return of kings  which were crucial in taking control of the narrative during the campaign all the while the media continues to nitpick inflate and manufacture anything they can turn into a controversy about the incoming trump administration narrative warfare is far from over
what can we do fortunately we have a master persuader in donald trump to lead the way but we at the grassroots the grunts in the trenches if you will must continue our efforts
first we need to begin to dehypnotize those that can be scott adams had some thoughts on that  but here are the crucial points
 the basis of the hypnosis in recent days has been around pairing the terms altright and fake news with all sorts of bad things
 take away that pairing and youve made significant inroads
ive ab tested this sort of thing numerous times remember mike cernovichs maxim that conflict is attention and attention is influence here are a few pointers
 just like with women frame control is paramount the inevitable tactic that theyll try to use is to associate anyone opposed to them with the worst elements of their side fortunately our opponents have arguably worse elements given their blanket of moral superiority and cultural influence refocus the frame on those make them own their own worst elements
 appeal to vanity most people like to think of themselves as rational tell them that their wordthinking is literally shutting down their critical thinking skills i did this with a girl after the first debate explaining to her that because the movie in her head pictured a mexican in a certain way her critical thinking skills turned off and that what trump said about the mexican judge would be equally applicable to someone of another heritage like german its a long story but her face was a picture tell them that theyre seeing things not based on reality but on the movies playing in their heads triggered by a certain word then watch the cognitive dissonance come
on the broader level heres what we can do
 continue on as usual continue to make a cultural impact get those websites books movies and so on out there echoing what one member of the forum said politics is air cover culture is the ground war they can try to censor fake news all they want but we are too numerous to control if we dont cooperate its now time to redouble our efforts
 dont talk to any aggrieved victimhood class on social media if theyre acting hostile to you theyll use any excuse to ban you law  disdain things you cannot have ignoring them is the best revenge
 begin to build new networks gab is up and coming and is far more free speech friendly
 i will echo what many others have said on the forum make fun of them theyre a prime target for humor believe me when i say most people are sick of the special snowflakes on the street as well as the media

this is a time of great opportunity but we need to readjust for the new moves our opponents are making theyre doing everything they can to censor us and delegitimize trump thats the next focus of the campaign we must delegitimize them in turn
but take heart that were now in the ascendant otherwise they wouldnt be making these moves i recall when i first visited return of kings and the forum nearly four years ago there was a general malaise in the atmosphere day after day it seemed we were suffering another defeat no longer
what a ride its been

Alex Ansary,the man behind the trump rally disturbance in reno,"us military hackers claim penetration of russia  
sputnik news 
us military hackers have penetrated russias electric grid telecommunications networks and kremlins command systems making them vulnerable to attack by secret american cyber weapons according to a series of reports by a major us television network 
nbc news disclosed the penetration in a series of reports explaining that us efforts parallel claims also by us officials that russia china and other nations have placed hidden malware on parts of us critical infrastructure 
the penetration by all sides appears to be in preparation for an allout war in cyberspace according to nbc news which said it was briefed by a us intelligence official and given an opportunity to review highly classified documents 
at the same time the network downplayed the prospect of a cyber war making it appear as if the leak was intended as a warning to us adversaries 
nbc news then attempted to link its explosive report to tuesdays us presidential election citing concerns of mischief by russian hackers that would fall far short of the armageddonlike scenario that the report implied 
instead the network explained us electionrelated concerns as cyber mischief which could involve releasing fake documents or creating bogus social media accounts to spread misinformation 
the obama administration has created a public but unconfirmed narrative that hackers controlled by the russian government have stolen emails from the democratic party headquarters a private computer used by presidential candidate hillary clinton while serving as secretary of state and computers used by clinton campaign chairman john podesta 
according to the narrative russia stole the emails and gave the messages to wikileaks which has flooded the internet with the material on a daily basis leading up to tuesdays election 
russia has denied any responsibility for the clintonrelated hacks and links between wikileaks and russian intelligence have never been substantiated 
moreover recent media reports in the united states indicate that clintons private server she used for official business during her tenure as secretary of state had been penetrated by at least five foreign intelligence services 
the emails have proved especially embarrassing for the clinton campaign by disclosing decisions in the clinton state department that favored large donors to the clinton foundation in what appear to be payforplay schemes of selling access and influence 
moreover the activity appears to coincide with lucrative speaking engagements for former president bill clinton",amtvmedia.com,Fake,english,16.496481406625215,12.22722258602208,50,9,2591,395,5.526582278481013,395.0,-0.3656534312002963,-0.2020278943791856,-0.1026002433859593,-0.1587209393517419,0.4317303041085713,-0.1508343535281204,0.0050632911392405,0.0,0.0050632911392405,0,0,0.0,0.0089658864426033,-0.4659,0.07,0.089,0.841,Negative,Moderate

Daniel Greenfield,sioux indians wish dakota pipeline protesters would go home,"hillary campaign launching attacks on the fbi october   
if the clinton campaign becomes any more deranged hillary will start running attack ads against the fbi this kind of tactic is already perilously close to an attack ad 
hillary clintons presidential campaign ratcheted up its attack on the director of the fbi on sunday circulating a draft letter critical of james comey to former federal prosecutors 
it is out of our respect for such settled tenets of the united states department of justice that we are moved to express our concern with the recent letter issued by fbi director james comey to eight congressional committees the clinton campaigns letter speaking for prosecutors said 
the letter was signed and provided to the daily beast by elkan abramowitz a former chief of the criminal division of the us attorney for the southern district of new york it is expected to be released sunday evening 
so we have the bizarre spectacle of hillary deciding that she needs to campaign against the head of the fbi who was just being praised for clearing her because when youre a paranoid personality who assembles lists of enemies this is how you react but its also telling that the clinton campaign finds this so threatening that it is waging war on the fbi",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,59,9,1262,215,4.841860465116279,215.0,-0.0904780771125522,-0.2020278943791856,-0.4542159921757957,-0.4409034815632257,-0.2440229745678241,-0.4396142128839882,0.0046511627906976,0.0,0.0046511627906976,0,0,0.0,0.0082361049879728,-0.9604,0.035,0.122,0.842,Negative,Very Strong

Dml Daily,border collapse amid election,"miley cyrus crying over trump victory video  shares by ike mclean  november    politics  
after it was announced that donald trump would be the  th president of the united states miley cyrus posted a video online of her crying over the results 
with tears rolling down her face cyrus says so probably like most peoplewell maybe not because given the resultmaybe i really am different and maybe a lot of people that im surrounded by think with open minds and open hearts like i do and i do want to say that ive been very vocal for my support for everyone besides donald trump heavily supported bernie heavily supported hillary and i still think that in her lifetime she deserves to be the first female president and thats what makes me so sad 
i just wish that she had that opportunity because she fought for so long and because i believe her when she says that she loves this country this is all shes ever done shes given her life to make it better but like donald trump so ironically played after his speech it said you cant always get what you want and happy hippies we adjust and we accept everyone for who they are and so donald trump i accept you she said and this hurts to say but i even accept you as the president of the united states and thats finebecause i think now i want to be hopeful 
she then went on to thank barack obama for everything he has done the past eight years and thanked hillary for inspiring us

Letsbereal,aig quadruples limits for terrorism insurance to  billion,"home this month popular  ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women  ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women david g brown 
david is a lifelong dissident and intellectual rebel he despises political correctness which replaces real needy victims with narcissistic leftists out for a free meal though still a young man he has watched society descend into its present morass with great sadness combined with a determination to help make things better he tweets when theres something worth tweeting here  october   girls 
forget the movies that set aloof men against loveseeking women it is men who are the hopeless romantics much if not most of the time and they express this extraordinary naivety by engaging in stupid behaviors that their fathers and other male role models should have beaten out of them though feminism demographic trends and socioeconomic realities encourage women to be entitled prima donnas men add to the feedback loop by rewarding modernday princesses 
of course there are sensible exceptions to avoiding the following behaviors a time and a place for example can be found for defending a woman most notably your mother or wife from someone elses verbal or physical attack likewise sometimes emergencies or certain serious events mean you should put your priorities aside to help a highquality woman who gives longterm value to your life that said in the vast majority of cases acting in this way is unnecessary timeconsuming resourcedraining and plain selfdestructive for a man 
so here are the five things many men perversely and uselessly keep doing for women  fighting for them 
i lost count long ago of the number of times i have seen a man step in to save a woman from either herself or a slight usually deserved against her a girl will behave like a pork chop at a restaurant club or elsewhere picking a verbal or even physical argument with an employee or fellow patron along comes captainsaveaho who might not even know the girl to protect her honor the expectation of many women that men will do this for them is bad enough let alone when a man does it of his own volition without being requested 
in return for risking a physical or similar altercation with other people the white knight invariably gets a smile a few words and perhaps a phone number from this point onwards though the interaction between mr white knight and the entitled damsel who causes her own distress invariably fizzles out and it is not just members of your typical white knight crowd who act this way men who are nominally good with women fall into this trap too confusing it with the opportunity to be alpha and dominate over another male the most common outcome sadly is that a womans very poor behavior is condoned by a man falling over himself to be her medieval champion  fighting over them not only is this bickering usually illadvised it is often exactly what she wants 
this stupid behavior is only marginally better than fighting for women and the two activities consistently overlap whilst competition in life including between men over women should be largely encouraged swathes of men are effectively scrapping over last sundays leftovers on a saturday three days after the refrigerator stopped working 
remember a woman can be attractive but because of her attitude and behavior have very little longterm value for you countless men live with the illusion that if they toil hard enough to get the goodlooking girl it must be worth it thats simply not the case in modern times to boot a lot of sexually thirsty men nowadays are chasing physically lowyield women their fathers and grandfathers would never have noticed 
at best the majority of men who fight over women are dueling over the prospect of snaring a girl who one of them will probably fuck a few times if at all and if they do manage to secure the girl for a longterm relationship the pairing usually implodes down the track the man either realizes he wasted his time or suffers greatly in material terms such as by being draped divorce raped 
in the meantime the girls being fought over have their egos stroked time and time again unattractive girls see themselves as attractive and attractive girls with foul entitled princess personalities find themselves validated once more everything in these situations is predicated on the men fighting and proving themselves rather than the women reaching an appropriate standard of physical and emotional femininity  paying for them what are you getting from the transaction with her and yes everything is transactional in malefemale relationships 
unless you are completely sure you have claimed the worlds best girl for yourself and even that belief is probably based on very false or temporary appearances you should ideally be investing less financially in the relationship than she is this may seem counterintuitive especially when a man is sexually valued by women for his status achievements and resources but we are not living in a time when almost every woman is marriageable a man providing for a woman can only justify it if she is of highquality and gives him something back in return on both these counts most men are paying for dud deals 
in every longterm relationship i have had i have put less into the relationship financially proportionallyspeaking almost always even the girls gross investment has either approximated mine or surpassed it for dates and during casual relationships too i pay for a womans time about as much as she pays for mine if not less 
when relationships end girls can and do play petty games over money or property you may be owed what matters however is how you conduct yourself overall only when a woman has materially invested in you or invests in you should you invest in her when patriarchy returns the malefemale dynamic will alter before that time be sure she does her fair share financially  shifting or sacrificing their priorities for them meanwhile he should be do everything else for himself 
unlike many other selfdestructive behaviors concerning women this one can be very incremental and hard to spot it is very easy to procrastinate on your work final exams selfdevelopment goals and the rest of your social life when what you feel is a highquality woman comes along in fact nature has basically designed you to do that by throwing your biochemistry into a druglike dependency at the beginning of a courtship in addition to these problems early on men are apt to continue the shelving of their other more personal demands after the relationship is well established 
on a topic i will explore in more detail in another article there should be certain hours in many days or simply days in general in which women do not even enter your mind contrast this with your average man who will throw away opportunities to further himself to please his girl and often shes not his girl for much longer as his neglect of himself becomes apparent in her less attracted mind by devoting yourself to a ho you become dispensable to a ho not just psychologically but physically financially and socially as well dont let yourself rot 
your body finances education and other forms of selfimprovement need to be your number one focus after all they are the only things you have or dont have  hours a day  days a year individual girls may come and go but your obligations to yourself remain paradoxically keeping these obligations to yourself are what attract girls in the first place a man who takes proper care of his money career body and social life gets women  moving to them for them sucker 
this is the one even my leftwing father warned me about but its something a lot of guys are yet to learn like shifting or sacrificing ones priorities moving to a girl for a girl is conducive to throwing your own needs into utter disarray every time i moved to where a girl of mine lived i did so mostly for myself whether to explore a new country for three months or find a new refreshing place to get my work done the relocation benefited me this is qualitatively far different from upending yourself to some new city for the mere chance to thrive and the desire to please a girl 
perhaps the saddest thing about the man who moves for his girl is that when he wants even a fraction of the favor he gave her hes often left in the lurch dont make this mistake either she must move to you or you move to her for a lot of reasons that dont revolve around her if the relationship fails and most of them do you leave yourself in an equal or better position than the one you would otherwise be in dont follow the crowd of thirsty males too many men slave away in a female desert girls are not nonexistent but theyre too often lowquality relative to what a man is willing to do for them 
snap yourself out of these behaviors and help your friends shake them off too you may not indulge in them regularly but the temptation to perform them at least sometimes is likely to be there more broadly we need to see a seismic shift in the way many men act become part of the solution

by mike dan 
posted thursday october   at am edt 
keywords art of sleeping  bedtime  comfortable mattress  deep sleep  naps  quality of sleep  relaxing sleep  sleep  sleep deep 
the quality of sleep has a great impact on ones productivity it will determine how effective and alert you will be throughout the next day the importance of having a relaxing sleep to the body cannot be overemphasized  it serves as a means to recharge the body and brain and give rest to all the vital organs of the body it is important for the bodys general health and vitality 
however the quality of sleep matters making your sleep deep relaxing and refreshing goes a long way to impact your health just as your body needs a good and balanced meal every day the body equally needs a deep and refreshing sleep it is unfortunate however that deep sleep evades most people the good news is that there are tricks that could be learned to make sleep more enjoyable there are little things you can do to ensure a deep and relaxing sleep here are some of them get your worries off the way 
if you are the type that thinks about your struggles during bedtime you have got to find a way to deal with it you could schedule a time to ruminate about your struggles during the day you could schedule a time to discuss your struggles with a confidant or write them in a journal by getting it out of your chest you will be keeping it off your mind which then limits the chances of it disturbing your sleep keep your naps short 
many people advise doing away with afternoon nap if you desire a good night and relaxing sleep however if you desire to nap at all keep it short you could adopt some simple routine such as maintaining a schedule make it early in the afternoon keep it short  brevity is the key limit afternoon nap to a maximum of  minutes try a more comfortable mattress for relaxing sleep 
a typical human spends over  of hisher entire life sleeping if relaxing sleep is this vital then attention should be given to where the art of sleeping is done  the mattress however an uncomfortable mattress could also limit the quality of sleep gotten how do you know when to change mattress do you have to try several sleeping positions before you can sleep are you fond of waking up and shifting positions do you wake up with back and joint pains 
if you can identify with the above it is time to consider a new mattress a good mattress should provide support for your curves and natural spine limit light exposure hinders relaxing sleep 
there is a natural occurring hormone in the body called melatonin it is controlled by exposure to light and helps regulate your sleepwake cycle you feel sleepy when the brain secretes more melatonin which occurs majorly during the dark however less melatonin is secreted when there is light making you more alert many aspects of our life can alter the production of melatonin however during the night you could develop some habit that will influence the production of melatonin some of such are within  to  hours of your bedtime avoid bright light reduce the brightness of your phone or tablet if you must use it avoid latenight tv it suppresses melatonin avoid reading with backlit device sleep in a dark room use heavy curtain to shade light from outside 
make vigorous exercise a priority 
one of the many advantages of exercise is that it helps enhance sleep hardly will you see any good exerciser that does not enjoy a sound sleep at night they are hardly a victim of insomnia exercise increases the amount of time you spend in deep and restorative stages of sleep 
vigorous exercise makes your sleep deep however light exercise as simple as some minutes of the walk could also improve your sleep quality note however that it could take a while before you see the influence of exercise on your sleep but it will come however avoid exercising when its close to your bedtime at least  hours to your bedtime is ideal carefully choose your meal 
the food you eat especially some hours to your bedtime also influences the level and quality of your sleep caffeine and nicotine intake should be reduced they contain a stimulant that can keep you alert for hours also do away with smoking it does not help your sleep avoid background noise

Henry Wolff,chinese immigrants demand protection from paris muggers,"posted on october   media selfdestruct over trump jared taylor american renaissance october   their hysteria and dishonesty have backfired 
from the start of donald trumps campaign the media have covered him dishonestly they have consistently portrayed him as a closet white supremacist who deliberately appeals to racists they have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the altright they are now working on another dishonest angle that donald trump is mainstreaming hate and bringing racism into public discourse the media clearly want to stampede voters into mrs clintons camp so as to spare us the agony of a racist in the white house 
the demonization campaign has backfired by trying to hang racial dissidents around donald trumps neck the media have given american renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before at the same time constant shouts of racist and bigot dont seem to hurt mr trump instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility the biggest irony though is that donald trump is probably not one of us at all but even small deviations from the castiron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about donald trump as a secret david duke fan 
media dishonesty started immediately when mr trump pointed out that some immigrants from mexico were criminals the press acted as if he had said all mexican immigrants are criminals then when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call haters and white supremacists liked mr trump there was no end of articles with titles such as  meet the horde of neonazis klansmen and other extremist leaders endorsing donald trump   top racists and neonazis back donald trump   heil donald trump neonazis white supremacists show support  and  the white nationalists who support donald trump  
these articles had a simpleminded purpose discredit mr trump by parading before the reader any nazi kluxer or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate the implication was that if racists were going to vote for donald trump he must be racist too 
this was deceitful and onesided when the chairman of the american communist party endorsed hillary clinton  no one suggested this meant she was a communist 
it is true that mr trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet bigot because he did not repudiate racists with the snorts of indignation respectability requires there was the famous exchange in february when a reporter pushed mr trump to disavow an endorsement from david duke as the hill reported it  david duke endorsed me ok alright i disavow ok trump said seeking to quickly move on to another question 
that same month there was another famous exchange with jake tapper of cnn  
tapper  will you unequivocally condemn david duke and say that you dont want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election 
donald trump  well just so you understand i dont know anything about david duke ok i dont know anything about what youre even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists so i dont know i dont know did he endorse me or whats going on because you know i know nothing about david duke i know nothing about white supremacists 
the media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy trump refuses to disavow white supremacists thats because he is one 
there are far better explanations first donald trump is a pugnacious man he doesnt like being pushed around by anyone especially not by journalists who hate him if mr tapper had belligerently demanded that mr trump agree that the sky is blue mr trump would have bridled at that 
second donald trump probably doesnt know anything about david duke or white supremacy i would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of david duke or any other alleged white supremacist it is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers not some carefully concealed racial consciousness 
the press has also pounced on donald trumps retweets of racist material which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist business insider for example published this shocking story   times donald trump has engaged with altright racists on twitter  not one of these tweets is obviously racist and it would be surprising if mr trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets realdonaldtrump has sent during the campaign 
now the press is working on another smeartrump angle recently i have been contacted by journalists from such places as bloomberg news reuters and the new york times  who clearly want to write that donald trump is mainstreaming hate that he is responsible for a huge surge in the altright they want to know about all the people who have been flocking to amrencom because of what donald trump says they want me to tell them about people who have been emboldened to speak out against minorities because donald trump has led the way they would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting nigger because mr trump wants to take a hard look at muslim immigrants 
i have explained to them as patiently as i can that they have it the wrong way around no one comes looking for amrencom because donald trump wants to build a wall they come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that mr trump is a racist they come looking for us because mrs clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the altright and her basket of deplorables i also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold donald trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him few people would have heard of the altright in their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors they are promoting the altright not donald trump 
i explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign it is trayvon martin michael brown black lives matters and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way not donald trump this will not change whether mr trump wins or loses the top landing pages on amrencom are analyses of race and crimesomething mr trump never talks about 
i also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think mr trump has mainstreamed hate by which they mean sensible observations about race i ask them to name a single person who has been emboldened to say something racist just because donald trump is the gop nominee of course they cant if anything it is the opposite mr trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest most commonsense observations about muslims and immigration anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever things could change if mr trump becomes president but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas 
what donald trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that mitt romney and john mccain are no different from barack obama when it comes to preserving whites their society and their culture i know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in november i know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the trump campaign 
i point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about giving the voters real choices i note that the trumpclinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election havent our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement especially among the young well now they have engagement alright but they dont like it they dont like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a  threat to democracy  liberals are such transparent hypocrites they claim to love democracy but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to 
the whole trumpisaracist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become i may be wrong but i have no reason to think donald trump thinks at all as we do he has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary american with normal instincts he doesnt want criminals sneaking across the border he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy he doesnt see why we need more muslims and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare millions of ordinary americans clearly agree with him and not because they are racially aware it is because they are decent fairminded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways 
i am convinced that mr trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race so far as i can tell he doesnt have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything he has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time but not because he is one of us 
maybejust maybehe will move in our direction its not impossible to imagine a president trump asking in an offhand way whats wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the united states or he might casually note that you cant expect as many blacks as asians in ap classes because they dont have the same levels of intelligence but i can imagine the opposite too president trump so bogged down in beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall 
there is one thing that donald trump has changed he has proven that republican bromides about taxes and small government dont excite people he has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties he has proven that americans do want their country to come first they dont want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries 
and even if he has not mainstreamed racism he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an american on october  roger cohen wrote in the new york times that donald trump is a phony liar blowhard cheat bully misogynist demagogue predator bigot bore egomaniac racist sexist sociopath and a dictatorinwaiting with a brats temper and a prigs scowl this must be one of the most unhinged hysterical outbursts in the history of american political journalism and it is unusual only for its wordiness not its tone 
dont the editors of the times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more americans believe in bigfoot  percent than trust newspapers  percent virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at donald trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself open petulant bias is driving more and more americans to social media and to sites like amrencom for their news 
despite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire american ruling class donald trump is going to get close to half of the vote on november  some  million people are going to vote for a man for whom roger cohen has emptied his dictionary trying to insult only one major newspaper has endorsed donald trump only one  and this is a man whom the american people might choose as their president what better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion between what americans think and what our rulers want us to think donald trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity 
whether he wins or not whether he is one of us or not donald trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors votersfinallyhave a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system on november th they could bring it crashing down but even if it still stands it is visibly weakened badly discredited these are the perfect conditions in which our ideas will flourish as never before",amren.com,Fake,english,16.093066489392562,11.326876277819148,55,7,12186,2110,4.749289099526067,2110.0,-0.2127782344848829,-0.5778293249656962,2.4359649256422427,2.5298516156076736,-0.3353818338711948,2.600595973112509,0.0028436018957345,0.0,0.0014218009478672,0,1,0.0,0.0051229418152742,-0.9978,0.111,0.136,0.752,Negative,Very Strong

Saurav Dutt,arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it,"prof rafiq islam responds to the vicechancellor of the university of punjab outlining the background of the hall case at the  shares
   
dear vice chancellor kamran
salam from the east coast of canada
thank you for taking the time to address this important issue regarding professor hall like yourself we all have been stunned by the voracity of dr mahons action we used to think academics of certain reputation were above the reach of the tentacles of the establishment we all hoped that a president would not resort to such a shameless pandering to a special interest group however bnai brith is not just a special interest group it is perhaps the most vindictive organization that has ever received prominence in the west allow me to elaborate
you have correctly identified bnai brith to be behind this movement against shutting down free speech while this statement is accurate this phenomenon of targeting canadian universities and canadian society is not something that started now not too long ago it used to be branded as the hidden hand behind the hidden hand during the harper era this operation became a fullblown politically driven policy directive the legislation that dr mahon pathetically relies upon is a product of the harper era harper had an extremist rightwing background and organizations like bnai brith have channelled that extremism to accomplish their hateful agenda as early as the s i personally observed the spirit of this unholy union during my tenure as the president of muslim student association at the university of alberta although harper didnt attend that university we were not too far from the epicentre of the neoconservatism movement that was brewing in canada we fastforward  years and come upon the type of events such as professor hall travesty that are products of that time in fact a web of such operations has been in full force for sometime in every aspect of canadian lives only recently we had this court ruling against canadian security intelligence service that was illegally spying on the public this gangsterlike involvement started in  shortly after harper and the neocon came to power
this is not to say that the public is protected from such unconscionable manoeuvring under a liberal government in fact the most notorious scandals involving government and human rights have erupted during the liberal regime take for instance the case of omar khadr travesty 
more creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere irish human rights activists against freedom of speech this case is something we had known albeit too late to intervene at the time and has been subsequently discredited publicly even during the harper regime  the overwhelming theme was pointed out by then barely  year old omar khadr who said  you dont care about me  this is what defines the mindset of these people bent on extremism over extremism to subdue public conscience
the attack on professor hall was particularly toxic but equally sinister attacks have taken place before some decade ago now defunct canadian islamic congress faced onslaught from all sides based on planted stories and baited manoeuvring it was the largest muslim organization at a time canadian muslims became the largest religious minority one particular episode involved bnai briths planted story involving a university professor who became the target of hate crime while at the same time investigated for hate crime if it wasnt for the humane and civic behaviour of the then university president current governor general david johnston it would have become career threatening if not life threatening event of the professor top university personnel told me in private how the university faced pressure from donors that wanted that professor to disappear from the academic as well as public arena the vendetta of this sort beggars belief even today what we dont know is how many of these assaults on conscience took place and has been brewing
clearly some of the faithful memberssympathizers apply it publicly such was the case of former professor turned politician irwin cotler who routinely infected the political arena with his prejudice and bias imported from the academia then there are others such as alan rock of university of ottawa that implanted manoeuvring of the political arena to the academia a third group would be lorna marsden of york university that abused authority to run a vindictive agenda yet others have found every other way possible to target a person of conscience all the meanwhile covering up all trails so the victim cannot point a finger to the attacker and has no recourse to justice or self defence it doesnt matter which category they belong to they all produce scandals and drag down the good name of the academia while agencies that are supposed to be uphold the rights and dignity of the academia stand by and for some cases join in to the atrocity this obscene attack on human rights and academic decency was once brought to light by late professor david noble who ended up suing york university and canadian jewish congress jointly for conspiring against him professor noble a jew himself faced the vilest of subjugation by organizations claiming to promote the rights of jews that wasnt enough dr noble had to take on human rights commission and other agencies that stood by either in complicity or in collusion with the university authority professor noble passed away before the lawsuit could see a day in court but soon university of ottawa would come in the picture with the infamous involvement of alan rock a man without a phd that was at the helm of the university mr rock recently left the universitybut not before leaving the universitys good name in the sewerage of politicking what dr mahon has done is bring this insidious modus operandi to yet another victim
had i not have the misfortune of being on the wrong side of this modus operandi in the last  years i would almost not understand what is at works here in old days such tactic would be unheardof in a university certainly such things couldnt happen in a civilized country i would exclaim
so what happened to professor hall is not new what is new is the waking up of the general public your letter reverberates the emotion of everyone with conscience that came to know about professor hall people are waking up and are beginning to ask for justice for instance in the context of csis an activist jim comeau wrote i would say its time to jail the highest ranking csis to send a clear message to the rest of them do something illegal straight to prison they damn well knew what they were doing was illegal
the peoples revulsion to such atrocious maligning of people of conscience was summed up in recent letter of julian assange who wrote on us general election day november  
yet some weeks ago in a tactic reminiscent of senator mccarthy and the red scare wikileaks green party candidate stein glenn greenwald and clintons main opponent were painted with a broad red brush the clinton campaign when they were not spreading obvious untruths pointed to unnamed sources or to speculative and vague statements from the intelligence community to suggest a nefarious allegiance with russia the campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publicationsbecause none exists
in the end those who have attempted to malign our groundbreaking work over the past four months seek to inhibit public understanding perhaps because it is embarrassing to them  a reason for censorship the first amendment cannot tolerate only unsuccessfully do they try to claim that our publications are inaccurate
of course recent events have allowed us to see this in the highest level of politics in the united states
to anyone with an iota of conscience there is no mystery here people are making their voice clearly known in the words of claire lanyado i prefer unpredictable to criminal and evil the problem is when a president of university for whatever reason decides to use his position to serve the special interest group deliberately there is no recourse for a professor to fight himher in other cases if such atrocity were launched against a student eg the case of freemanmaloy vs lorna marsden of york university  the student an antizionist jew could bring a lawsuit of misfeasance in public office with the help of yet another jewish lawyer peter rosenthal who himself is a university professor of mathematics it was struck down by the court and then it was overruled by the court of appeals at the end the university settled and dr marsden the embattled president was gone the morale of this story is the path to justice is steep but for a professor the path to justice is becoming impossible
the irony is that it is the people harboring so much hate who tell others that they are committing hate crimes just because they dare speak out against an atrocity of course they pick their targets that are perceived as weak and vulnerable and they attack the target only after making sure that the target cannot run to anyone for justice
thats how extremism works

Daniel Greenfield,dems file complaint wdoj against fbi for investigating hillary,"obama donations funneled through fake bonuses   
this is some great investigative work and its the kind of story that flies under the radar and its just a small component of the democratic machine but it is what the setup looks like  
jon tester didnt come all the way from montana for the scrambled eggs and bacon the us senator virtually unknown in boston was in a conference room at the thornton law firm that june morning to cash in at one of the most reliable stops on the democratic fundraising circuit a law firm that pours millions into the coffers of the party and its politicians 
tester a massive jovial man who raises livestock on his family farm was more compelling than many of the other breakfast guests all of them political candidates the firm hoped would defend the interests of trial attorneys but the drill was basically the same the personal injury lawyers listened politely for a few minutes then returned to their offices and tester walked away with  in checks 
but a striking thing happened the day tester visited in  partner david c strouss received a payment from the firm labeled as a bonus that exactly equaled his  contribution to testers campaign the maximum allowed a few days later partner garrett bradley  until recently the house assistant majority leader on beacon hill  got a bonus too exactly matching his  gift to tester 
thats quite a coincidence 
from  through  strouss and bradley along with founding partner michael thornton and his wife donated nearly  million to democratic party fundraising committees and a parade of politicians  from senate minority leader harry reid of nevada to hawaii gubernatorial candidate david ige to senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts over the same span the lawyers received  million listed as bonuses in thornton law firm records more than  of the contributions precisely matched bonuses that were paid within  days 
no corruption to see here now lets move on to another fake scandal 
thorntons lawyers were especially generous to vice president joe biden one of washingtons strongest advocates for trial lawyers contributing more than  to his campaigns from  to  
during president obama and bidens reelection campaign in  michael thornton hosted a fundraiser for the obama victory fund at his house in cambridge where biden was the guest of honor some of the biggest donors  some thornton partners gave   were escorted into a private room and offered the chance to be photographed with biden said someone who was there thornton records show the lawyers were reimbursed for those donations

the president has to be kicking himself over this one 
as his term in office comes to a close it seems as if barack obama may have missed out on a pretty spectacular opportunity earlier today the president was told that he had been allowed to sleep in the white house this whole time after he spent nearly two full terms living in a hotel by reagan national airport 
sorry mr president but its true you really blew your chance on this one 
having booked an extended stay at the airport hilton upon his inauguration back in  barack and his family have resided in an atriumview room with two double beds and complimentary wifi for the past eight years but earlier this week when a senior advisor asked the president why he had chosen to live by the airport instead of the white house you could tell that obama hadnt realized the choice was his to make until that very moment 
yes obamas accomplished a lot over the years but hes got to be wondering how much more progress he might have made living at  pennsylvania avenue he would have had a lot more time to work on signature policies like the affordable care act if he hadnt wasted so much of his mornings commuting from the airport to the oval office on the dc metro theres no doubt the countless hilton rewards points obama has accrued is a nice perk but that doesnt soften the blow of leaving the neoclassic mansion built exclusively to house the commander in chief and his family empty for two full terms 
this is something obama is going to regret for a long time to come 
nobody ever explicitly told me that i could live there until now said a clearly disappointed obama as he waited patiently for a set of fresh towels while sasha and malia love being on the same floor as the pool here i now wish we had stayed at the lavish squarefoot private residence in the white house for the past eight years one time in  i slept underneath my desk after a late night and i was worried someone was going to find me there in the morning and yell at me now im being told we apparently have a personal chef and dozens of butlers this sucks

pac522,no title,"october has been a portentous month for the presidential campaign in the beginning of the month women came forward accusing trump of unwelcome advances later fbi director james comey reopened the criminal investigation of hillary clinton after finding more government emails on pervert anthony weiners computer but the most important event may be a meme campaign that highlights hillarys support forcing women to register for the selective service
the meme campaign consisted of dozens of fake ads posted under the draftourdaughters hashtag that highlight two very important policy points of the hillary campaign first hillary is a radical feminist thus she favors equality in all thingsthat includes equality in combat as a step in that direction hillary told the huffington post that she will support legislation to register for the draft
young women may think registering for the draft is not a big deal they should reconsider because of the second policy of the clinton campaign she will almost certainly start a war against russiaa war that will see those young women drafted into combat on the front lines
hillary has repeatedly blamed russia for wikileaks and she stated that she would get revenge through military action
as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses 
the draftourdaughters campaign could be the thing that brings down the hillary campaign to get elected hillary relies on two demographics people of color and liberal white women up until now women have been able to support leftist social policy because it did not impact them negatively if they become aware that hillary intends to draft them into combat to fight a war with russia they may rethink the wisdom of their equalist position
here are some of the best examples of the draftourdaughters campaign

i feel this one is the most powerful it clearly states hillarys intention to put women into combat and start a war with russia unlike the arab nations that the us has been toppling for the neocons russia has a formidable military and nuclear weapons any military conflict will not be short and easy that means it will highly likely that young women will soon find themselves getting blown to smithereens if they elect hillary



the above three ads all target the weak cowardly men who either support hillary or the never trump cuckservatives in the alt right these men are frequently portrayed as being cuckolded by wives hence they are often mocked for their wives having children who are not their own my wifes son or my wifes daughter
the ad below drives this point home even more forcefully while women might encourage their men to vote hillary or oppose trump for being too alpha they secretly despise the weakness of these men

the following ads are directed to convincing women of the ramifications of their decision to vote feminist feminism taken to its logical conclusion means you are going to have to trade your louboutins for combat boots


 


lots of the ads emphasize hillarys extremely aggressive stance toward putin and russia she has blamed wikileaks on russian hacking even though there is no proof that the russians were to blame and she and the obama administration have been saber rattling against russia in syria
the really frightening thing is that mainstream pundits are now starting to parrot the idea that the us must go to war with russia all the more reason to elect someone who is not controlled by wealthy donors like hillary


the ad below indicates that our enemy putin has a saner view on women in combat than the democrats do

while the campaign is mostly geared to point out hillarys intention to draft women it also reminds men that their lives will not be spared in the conflagration that hillary will start

the media often portrays war as a sanitized affair a soldier safely positioned in a uslocated command center controls a drone that takes out the bad guys the reality of war is that people from both warring factions die and are maimed once hillary gets in it wont be just men dying in large numbers women will experience equality in having their lives snuffed out


a final ad drives home the point that the future war with russia and iran and syria will not be any sort of conflict against barbarism or evil it will be for hillarys power trip 
conclusion elections matter for decades women have voted for leftist policies that have put the burden on other people if they are successful in electing hillary they will face the bitter consequences of their decisions but unfortunately they will not be the only people impacted thousands of innocent americans russians syrians and iranians will also have to pay the price of their virtue signaling
the draftourdaughters campaign may be enough to wake some of them up from their folly

Alex Ansary,analyst most americans like neither candidate,"feds warn nyc officials about possible al qaeda attack  
new york post 
new york city law enforcement authorities are on high alert after receiving a warning by the feds about a possible attack by al qaeda on the eve of election day sources said 
us intelligence officials alerted joint terrorism task forces of the threat which also included texas and virginia  though specific sites targeted for monday in the three states were not mentioned a federal source told the post 
mayor bill de blasio said friday he had learned of the threat several days ago during classified briefings 
we are still very much assessing the credibility it is not at all clear how credible this is de blasio told wnycs brian lehrer on his weekly radio show were certainly in a vigilant position 
hizzoner said the nypd is planning an extraordinary police presence for tuesday when americans go to the polls 
for the first time in memory there will be two presidential campaigns having their victory celebrations in new york city on tuesday night he said quickly correcting himself that only one candidate will be celebrating 
donald trump the republican nominee will be at the new york hilton midtown on sixth avenue while hillary clinton his democratic counterpart will be at the javits convention center across town on th avenue 
police also will be heavily deployed for the new york city marathon on sunday de blasio said 
meanwhile gov andrew cuomo declined to confirm the threat friday but also noted the high state of alert for election day 
we have more state police more national guard more soldiers on duty than ever before he said so the bad news is new york is often a threat the good news is weve been dealing with this now for over a decade and we have prepared for it 
the nypd and the port authority of new york and new jersey said they had been alerted to the possible attacks 
we are aware of the information we have been working with the fbi through the joint terrorism task force and our counterterrorism and intelligence bureaus the nypd said in a statement 
we continue to encourage anyone with any information that could be relevant to the safety of our city to contact law enforcement the department said 
the port authority  which operates airports tunnels and bridges in and around the big apple  said it too was prepared 
we are continuing the high level of security we have had in place at all of our facilities for many months spokesman steve coleman told the post 
the fbi did not comment specifically about the threat against the three states but said counterterrorism and homeland security authorities remain vigilant and wellpostured to handle attacks 
the fbi working with our federal state and local counterparts shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety an fbi official said 
fridays threat followed a report by nbc news that the us government believes hackers from russia or other countries may try to unleash cyberattacks to wreak havoc ahead of election day

gop nominee donald trump took time out of a relentless campaign schedule wednesday to spend around an hour opening a new hotel prompting one cnn reporter to accuse trump of taking time out of swing states meanwhile hillary clinton is again nowhere to be seen

so to people who say youre taking time out of swing states to go do this you say bash asked 
i say the following you have been covering me for the last  long time i did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches and ive been doing this for weeks straight trump responded 
for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps and yet youll ask me that question i think thats a very rude question to be honest with you trump exclaimed 
trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit 
while cnn has continuously run defense for hillary clinton amid a myriad of scandals and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates the network has been forced to admit that hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule 
last month for example hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in orlando florida 
and in august hillary took seven of the first  days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance

they talked about the medias continuing attack on trump he granted an interview to  minutes leslie stahl who constantly interrupted him preventing him from answering the questions she posed to him trump importantly insisted that he will continue to bypass the media and communicate directly with his supporters via social media he also seemed to prioritize tightening the immigration law over immediately deporting all illegal aliens which doctors duke and slattery agreed was the proper strategy

Walter Williams,the rich and us,"daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
in the final stretch of the election hillary rodham clinton has gone to war with the fbi 
the word unprecedented has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired but its still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the fbi 
but thats exactly what hillary and her people have done coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of cnn from their hospital beds would assume that fbi director james comey is hillarys opponent in this election 
the fbi is under attack by everyone from obama to cnn hillarys people have circulated a letter attacking comey there are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting trump it wouldnt be too surprising if the clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the fbi 
the fbis leadership is being warned that the entire leftwing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after hillary and the fbis credibility is being attacked by the media and the democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the clinton foundation and hillary clinton 
the covert struggle between fbi agents and obamas doj people has gone explosively public 
the new york times has compared comey to j edgar hoover its bizarre headline james comey role recalls hoovers fbi fairly or not practically admits up front that its spouting nonsense the boston globe has published a column calling for comeys resignation not to be outdone time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women 
james carville appeared on msnbc to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane he accused comey of coordinating with house republicans and the kgb and you thought the vast right wing conspiracy was a stretch 
countless media stories charge comey with violating procedure do you know whats a procedural violation emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server 
senator harry reid has sent comey a letter accusing him of violating the hatch act the hatch act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of obama as the tenth amendment but the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the wikipedia article on the hatch act under the table while accusing the fbi director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against hillary ever 
if james comey is really out to hurt hillary he picked one hell of a strange way to do it 
not too long ago democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave hillary clinton a pass in a prominent public statement if he really were out to elect trump by keeping the email scandal going why did he trash the investigation was he on the payroll of house republicans and the kgb back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where vladimir putin and paul ryan talked him into taking a look at anthony weiners computer 
either comey is the most cunning fbi director that ever lived or hes just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a doj leadership whose political futures are tied to hillarys victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs 
the only truly mysterious thing is why hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected federal agency most americans like the fbi while hillary clinton enjoys a  unfavorable rating 
and its an interesting question 
hillarys old strategy was to lie and deny that the fbi even had a criminal investigation underway instead her associates insisted that it was a security review the fbi corrected her and she shrugged it off but the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the fbi 
pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy but it was a better one that picking a fight with the fbi while lunatic clinton associates try to claim that the fbi is really the kgb 
there are two possible explanations 
hillary clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the fbi now that she believes that victory is near the same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the fbi for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign 
but the other explanation is that her people panicked 
going to war with the fbi is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign its an act of desperation when a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the fbi thats not hubris its fear of what the fbi might be about to reveal about her 
during the original fbi investigation hillary clinton was confident that she could ride it out and she had good reason for believing that but that hillary clinton is gone in her place is a paranoid wreck within a short space of time the positive clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the fbi 
theres only one reason for such bizarre behavior 
the clinton campaign has decided that an fbi investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival and so its gone all in on fighting the fbi its an unprecedented step born of fear its hard to know whether that fear is justified but the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot 
clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation they knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions now suddenly they are no longer in control and they are afraid 
you can smell the fear 
the fbi has wiretaps from the investigation of the clinton foundation its finding new emails all the time and clintonworld panicked the spinmeisters of clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire all thats here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance but this isnt how you react to smoke its how you respond to a fire 
the misguided assault on the fbi tells us that hillary clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup the email setup was a preemptive cover up the clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief right or wrong that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed 
the clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption bribery sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years this is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out and they dont want fbi investigators anywhere near it 
the campaign against comey is pure intimidation its also a warning any senior fbi people who value their careers are being warned to stay away the democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the fbi its an ugly and unprecedented scene it may also be their last stand 
hillary clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle but shes never shown fear or desperation before now that has changed whatever she is afraid of it lies buried in her emails with huma abedin and it can bring her down like nothing else has",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,82.22642928926737,15,4,7367,1295,4.664864864864865,1295.0,-1.4357798082081898,-1.141531470845462,1.160994050233498,1.2521917717056772,-0.418700273942073,1.293064943251219,0.0077220077220077,0.0,0.0007722007722007,0,5,0.0,0.0155952906824586,-0.9995,0.087,0.186,0.727,Negative,Very Strong

washington dc  in what could prove to be the proverbial nail in the coffin of hillary clintons presidential ambitions an email released by wikileaks this morning  the th batch of emails from clinton campaign chair john podesta  reveals potential criminal intent to violate a court order for subpoenaed documents 
john podesta sent the message only hours after the new york times reported that clinton might have violated federal records requirements by using the server according to the latest batch of podesta emails released by wikileaks 
the email in question  sent by podesta on march   reveals the clinton campaign chair directing cheryl mills hillarys attorney and chief of staff to destroy emails that had already been subpoenaed 
the email exchange between podesta and mills came suspiciously on the same day that news broke regarding clintons use of a private email server 
after news of clintons private email server became public podesta wrote to mills not to sound like lanny but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later podesta told mills mills responded think you just got your new nick name 
it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out exactly what podesta meant by dump the emails when taking into account the fact that this was transpiring just as news of the private server was breaking what this email does is provide insight into the coverup process  and exposes a willful intent to break the law additionally it reveals exactly how swiftly the clinton camp moved to obscure the truth from both investigators and the public alike 
according to a report by the new york post  
in december  hillary clinton  now the democratic presidential nominee  turned over about  pages of workrelated email to the state department but that fact wasnt revealed until the times reported on her use of the private server 
on march    a week after the podestamills exchange  clinton addressed the email scandal and announced she had deleted about  personal emails 
the emails reference to lanny is likely in reference to lawyer lanny davis who served as special counsel to thenpresident bill clinton as well as spokesperson for the president and the white house on matters regarding campaignfinance investigations and other legal issues 
interestingly zero hedge reports that a search for lanny davis reveals a suspicious exchange between clinton campaign manager robby mook and podesta from march   just days after the above mentioned exchange in which mook tells podesta 
we gotta zap lanny out of our universe cant believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on tv 
hillarys team was apparently upset that bill clintons special counsel was engaging in a transparent course of action and moved to zap lanny out of our universe 
while it isnt clearly spelled out exactly which emails podesta is referring to in his email the fact that he wrote better do so sooner than later on the day news broke publicly regarding clintons email server strongly indicates that the actions were a responsive measure meant to obscure any investigation into the matter 
clintons entire narrative regarding her private email server has seemingly unraveled and her methodical plan to strategically impede the state departmentfbi investigation by deleting the evidence is now on full display for the public to see 
hopefully wikileaks next upcoming podesta email dumps can provide even further context to this already damning email of course hillarys spin doctors are hard at work thinking up a new narrative to work around this latest revelation regarding the willful attempt by clintons team to usurp a federal investigation

buffalo ny  in their relentless and often violent pursuit to control what citizens can and cannot put in their bodies the state leaves behind a trail of blood and suffering as the buffalo police department illustrated last week this trail often contains the blood of defenseless animals 
police incompetence coupled with deadly training came to a head last week and wreaked havoc on the residents of buffalo the narcotics division of the buffalo police department executed a series of drug raids last week leading to a handful of arrests and the seizure of small quantities of drugs  mostly cannabis 
after the department released their heroic numbers to the press on how much dangerous cannabis was taken off the streets they remained conveniently silent about the dogs they slaughtered along the way 
on friday morning buffalo cops in their search for a  lb  black male raided the home of michael urban  a   lb white male 
while police were ramming the innocent mans face into his kitchen floor urban pleaded with them not to kill his dog but it was to no avail 
police took aim at the helpless dog who according to urban was simply standing there in a nonthreatening manner boom one officer fired but the bullet only injured urbans monthold pit bull named gotham sending him running away frightened and crying 
as the dog is wailing in agony another officer fires a round directly into the dogs skull exploding the innocent animals head but it gets worse 
urban lives on the second floor of an apartment when the second officer shot that bullet went through the floor and almost killed the tenant downstairs 
what just happened urban recalls as the bullet hole went through the floor through the ceiling as the dogs blood is dripping through the downstairs apartment whos accountable 
as gothams blood drips from the bullet hole in urbans floor and out of the hole of jami krafchaks ceiling in the apartment below cops decided to go after her too 
after they nearly killed her cops raided krafchaks home she was manhandled searched with no warrant and humiliated as she stood there in her nightgown 
neither urban nor krafchak were charged with a crime 
the night before the heroic cops of the buffalo narcotics division killed an innocent mans beloved pet they raided the home of cory and cindy meer 
according to meers lawyer matthew albert  meer and his twoyearold son watched helplessly as jackboots murdered their beloved family dog damian a sixyearold pit bull 
meer tells artvoice that his dog was not a threat to officers he is the most family friendly dog ive ever had hes never hurt anyone said meer he would have licked the cops 
just like urban meer lied face down as he begged the cops not to shoot damian again this was to no avail 
as meers yearold watched in horror a cop blasted the family dog to death 
my son lost his best friend right in front of him meer said 
also like urban meer was not arrested however a friend at his house allegedly had a small amount of marijuana on him so the raid was justified according to police 
according to meers attorney he has  active cases of dogs being killed by the same squad 
they are going to say they are going after dangerous drug dealers albert said out of the cases i have theyve hit the wrong houses numerous times  found nothing numerous times and i think at best theyve found a few pills at one of these houses charges i got dismissed because they were filed wrong 
in  the free thought project reported on a freedom of information act request for use of force incidents within the buffalo police department the information was shocking 
according to use of force reports buffalo police shot  dogs from jan   through sept  seventythree of those dogs died nineteen survived 
to provide a comparison buffalos numbers more than triple the amount of dog shooting incidents involving police in cincinnati a municipality of similar size 
the numbers are what the numbers are buffalo police chief of detectives dennis richards said in an interview with wgrz in  certainly no officer takes any satisfaction in having to dispatch a dog 
apparently however they do it is not like buffalo residents have more dogs than other parts of the country this department seemingly takes satisfaction in killing peoples dogs 
when asked if the buffalo police have undergone any special training in regards to dealing with dogs or the handling of dogs in a nonlethal manner chief richards said it has not come to that point in buffalo that weve implemented any of those other techniques 
apparently killing a dog every other week or two in a hour period is just dandy and they see no problem with it or reason to seek out training to deal with such a high rate of puppycide 
something has to be done however and it is far more than just training the most effective action that would need to be taken would be to drastically reduce the instance of noknock search warrants according to an aclu report  percent of swat raids are searches for drugs 
if we want to end puppycide we have to end the drug war  the two are not mutually exclusive matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist share google  cousinscootie 
adam arroyo still waiting for justice from a  killing of his dog on a wrong address raid wtf are the judges in buffalo doing handing out noknock search warrants for refer with the track record of buffalo narcotics 
noknock search warrants this is the real crime 
the words search warrant cant even apply in these cases its more like an execution warrant 
the only acceptable cause to conduct a raid especially on a civilian residence is if there is a hostage situation 
no hostage no raid common sense 
so a bunch of steroid junkies have to miss out on playing war games with civilian lives well too bad we can call that an acceptable loss mike 
i hope and pray that everyone of these thug cops that shot dogs get shot themselves and left to bleed out in the gutter like the trash they truly are gordon klock 
they clearly get some nonadmitted sense of satisfaction by killing peoples pets in front of them  we all are coming to know that there is absolutely no reasoning with these sadistic clowns the war on drugs has always been a scam to generate prison labor  terrorize the populace whilst maintaining the naive illusion that it is all somehow morally responsible behavior to harm  incarcerate people over such an exaggerated threat more likely to oneself if at all  they really seem to enjoy scaring the helpless as they commit these acts of brutality that wouldve been illegal for them to do three or four decades ago katz ro

trump being trump he stepped on stage and immediately wrecked any chance republicans had of taking advantage of the email story 
trump went into full hyperbolic overdrive in new hampshire by claiming that the fbis reopening of the investigation was bigger than watergate 
the republican nominee took back his claim that the system is rigged 
video following fbi announcement into clintons emails trump remarks the system might not be as rigged as i thought httpstcokiuxbvef 
 abc news politics abcpolitics october   
trump said but with what ive just announced previously it might not be as rigged as i thought right the fbi i think theyre going to right the ship folks i think theyre going to right the ship and theyre going to save their great reputation by doing so the speculation is that the fbi is likely to review the new emails and stick by their original finding that hillary clinton did nothing wrong 
trump and the republicans are jumping to some conclusions they know that clinton is guilty without any evidence to support their beliefs they are assuming that the fbi is going to find evidence that hillary clinton did something wrong and they think that the emails are their ticket to getting trump elected 
trump has no political skills and no idea when to use a gentle touch and stop the republican nominee destroyed any hope that the gop had of using the reopened email investigation to their advantage by letting his habits of lying and changing positions on a whim take hold

Alex Ansary,opinion economics is a form of brain damage,"netflix ceo tvs future includes hallucination pills  
independent 
the future of tv might everyone taking hallucinogenic drugs according to the head of netflix 
the threats to the streaming tv company might not be amazon or other streaming services but instead pharmacological ways of entertaining people reed hastings has said 
and just as films and tv shows are a supposedly improved version of other entertainments those same things might eventually become defunct he said in the same way that the cinema and tv screen made the opera and the novel much smaller something else might be on the way to do the same thing the netflix boss said at a wall street journal event 
those challenges could come from anywhere he said they might not be another form of screen is it vr is it gaming is it pharmacological mr hastings asked the event 
he went on to say that it might be possible that in the coming years someone will develop a drug that will make people get the same experiences that at the moment come from streaming services like netflix apparently making reference to the matrix he said that we might be able to take one pill to escape into a hallucination and then another to come back 
in twenty or fifty years taking a personalized blue pill you just hallucinate in an entertaining way and then a white pill brings you back to normality is perfectly viable mr hastings said and if the source of human entertainment in thirty or forty years is pharmacological well be in real trouble 
his references to the matrix  and to being in trouble  recall arguments that have recently been made by tech billionaires including elon musk and sam altman both have suggested that it might be possible that we are part of a simulated universe  something that they said might be part of a virtual reality world but could just as easily be the result of a druginduced hallucination 
mr hastings didnt indicate whether or not netflix would look to make such drugs itself or how it would fend off any companies that did but it does sound a little like something out black mirror which netflix is showing the new season of at the moment",amtvmedia.com,Fake,english,16.496481406625215,12.22722258602208,43,8,2125,374,4.649732620320855,374.0,-0.579678706601875,-0.3899286096724409,-0.2258906413814926,-0.1916422359430816,-0.4336343152779233,-0.1845253371196383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9857,0.11,0.034,0.856,Positive,Very Strong
Don Wrightman,youtube censoring videos  on censorship,"by headly westerfield on fri oct th  at  pm as megyn kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her share on twitter print this post 
earlier this week friday fox follies  under the assumption the explosive  and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich would be this weeks lede  i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it  thats when he got personal  accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues  this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments  i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience 
then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly  watch 
as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof  rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal  of which he is owner  to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news 
if they are going to make a network that is going to be a postailesposttrump it will be around megyn kelly chris wallace and shep smith and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard said andrew tyndall a televisionnews consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr murdoch were not changing directionthat would be business suicide he said mr oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year and mr murdoch said were going to want bill to stay with us mr hannitys contract isnt up until  ms kelly has forged close ties to mr murdochs sons particularly lachlan murdoch who is coexecutive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the situation said 
fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well 
from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that  by the daily beasts tim teeman  
imagine then her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praiseridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon vanity fair megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work pajiba and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now the stir note the grudging headlines because of kellys employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional leftwing context throughout her career to date the fword mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a rightfacing institution and not be  percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for full disclosure i worked for the times of london a british rupert murdochowned newspaper for over  years 
aside from the fact that when she tilts right she tends to tilt altright the biggest knock on kelly is that shes too hardedged marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee but kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy  this makes her less attractive to other networks shes hoping to change that impression when she cohosts live with kelly ripa the kelly  kelly show the morning after the election  think of her as a designated hitter trying to knock murdochs hardball right out of the park

 they know that sacrifice isnt just a word but a set of meanings associated with that particular word 
 they ate two raw eggs every morning two raw eggs in the afternoon and two raw eggs after sundown because thats just what you did 
 they were  feet tall with long terrible teeth and arms thick as a clippers mast and their awful strength was matched only by their appetites 
 they know that this is the best way to tie a tie 
 they were married by age  had a house by  sucked the tongue out of a jackals mouth by  had their arms and legs ripped off on the radio by  and did it all over again by  
 some of them were named leland which is wild 
 they could get under the hood of any car and tell you exactly how theyd fuck it 
 the previous holder of that title was the generation that came up with the idea for pets so you gotta think this ones pretty great 
 they never threw anything out if they could tuck it under one of their folds 
 you could kill  or even  of them and you still wouldnt have killed all of them 
 when it really really mattered they put aside differences of race creed sex and nationality to do world war ii 
 they drove the hideous tasmanian tiger extinct 
 theyre definitely the last generation to ever witness this in person 
 many of them live underground pretty impressive 
 their ranks include frank sinatra john travoltas dad and dagwood from blondie  
 they never left a man behind thats why we have bruce 
 they fought for civil rights but also against civil rights but they won the fight but they really tried pretty hard to shut that fight down so maybe that ones kind of a wash

Ricardo Sanchez,research finds that women as a group dont pay taxes,"shopify erased our store from the internet while i was fulfilling  orders shopify erased our store from the internet while i was fulfilling  orders november   work  money 
to launch a return of kings tshirt shop i decided to go with shopify because of how much easier it is to launch than a selfhosted store i signed up with them paid for one year of service and did a prelaunch with a small group of readers which resulted in  orders as i began fulfilling them shopify pulled the plug on the entire store without warning both the public storefront and the administrative backend with all our data 
because of shopifys decision my customers couldnt access their order status i had no way of informing them of what happened and i couldnt fulfill remaining orders they put both me and  individuals in the lurch for no legitamate reason forcing me to threaten legal action in order to get enough information to complete fulfillment of all orders the backstory 
there are many open source solutions for hosting a web store the problem with them is that it takes extra time to create the store and maintain it compared to services like shopify squarespace bigcommerce magento and others to get the rok store up and running as quickly as possible i picked shopify because of their competitive prices not knowing that i was in for a far greater price down the road 
after i set up the store featuring photos of yours truly in our first tshirt i collected email addresses of those who were most interested with participating in the prelaunch i sent this group an email announcing the store and  of them took action ordering a tshirt or two the shirt in question 
during this time i received an email from a shopify risk analyst by the name of justin he asked me to send in identification which i was happy to do and then asked me for more information 
thanks for signing up with shopify payments and providing your id 
in order to complete this initial review and ensure payments continue to be sent to your account we would need a little bit more information 
if you could send me any documentation you may have to validate the business that would be great examples would be a business bank statement business license or business registration documents 
could you also confirm where youre primarily operating your business from 
i sent in my business incorporation documents my irs employer number designation a recent bank statement from my usbased bank and a note of how i often travel through eastern europe but that my business bank accounts and tax status all reside in the united states in spite of that shopify unjustly classified me as a foreign business and gave me no means to dispute it 
unfortunately shopify payments is currently only available to companies that are based in australia canada united kingdom and the united states so we are not able to help with payments for your site right now its frustrating for us to have to turn down good businesses but we need to make sure were abiding by both us and international regulations this means that any successful charges you have will be transferred to you on schedule but you wont be able to use shopify payments to accept any further payments  
despite the information provided our payment processing partner needs to ensure that the shops are based operating from and have a substantial presence in the united states 
ultimately their decision is final and we must respect it 
according to the united states federal government and the irs my company is american and liable to pay american taxes but to shopify im not an american business the repercussion from this was that i couldnt use shopifys own payment system shopify payments and had to pay a  extra commision on all orders but this wasnt a huge setback since there were many other payment options i stayed the course because i wanted to do an ontime opening for my readers i could always change stores later when it was convenient for me the disaster 
i have a worker based in the united states who maintains the shirt inventory and is charge of shipping them out he printed most of the shipping labels for the first batch of orders and got ready for shipment before he was finished i tried to log into the admin area of the store to monitor his progress and saw this 
the public storefront was also taken down there was no longer any way for me to know who my customers were and what they ordered i couldnt even send them an email i then received this from justin 
hello 
im afraid that after reviewing your information and website we believe your business presents a level of risk for customer disputes that we will be unable to support on shopify 
we will transfer your existing payments to you but will be unable to accept any additional payments on your behalf from shopify payments 
im sorry we wont be able to help with your business 
regards 
justin 
after i read this email i was absolutely livid ive been doing business on the internet for over fifteen years and have never had a situation where a company pulled the rug out from under me and my customers in a way that i would personally classify as fraud 
they allowed me to take  orders begin processing them and then removed all access so i could not complete fulfillment imagine if you bought a shirt from me and then tried to access the store to see the status of your order you would have no way to know whats going on and would probably think that i took your money and ran shopify created a situation of unneeded worry for  individuals while directly hurting my reputation as if im running some sort a scam operation the phone call to support 
i called support and got on the line with a level  support tech i told him the situation as calmly as i could his response send an email reply to justin this was unacceptable because politely complying with him through email beforehand had only resulted in the deletion of my entire store without warning i demanded to speak with someone from the risk department but the support tech told me there was no way to patch me through since he was working remotely i was not calling shopifys main office but someone sitting in the middle of nowhere in his pajamas 
i also told the support tech that there was no further information asked of me that this was a unilateral closing of my shop while i was in the middle of fulfillment if shopify is so worried about fraud why would they leave  individuals in a position where they would believe they got defrauded and start initiating chargebacks with their credit card companies i had no choice but to threaten legal action i told the support tech that if shopify doesnt give me a way to complete these  orders i would pursue all legal means as a response to what i saw as fraud 
the support tech put me on hold after a few minutes of chatting with the risk team he said that they have given him permission to send me a csv file of all my orders i decided that this was enough to satisfy the  individuals who purchased from me but it still didnt allow me an easyway to process exchanges or refunds if one of my customers was unsatisfied with the shirt 
before ending the call with the support tech i told him to relay to justin and his team that they have created so much ill will by the way they have treated me that i will ensure that everyone knows exactly what they did not just to me but also to my customers who had an unfortunate experience because of their ecommerce platform 
using the csv file i received i was able to contact my customers to let them know of the situation and complete fulfillment many of them have already received their tshirts in the mail the lesson 
shopify has every right to choose who to do business with and i would not be particularly upset if they said i have to go elsewhere after fulfilling open orders  but the way they removed all access from my store is absolutely reprehensible and the stuff of nightmares for a business owner no owner wants to wake up one day and find that everything is gone with no way to contact his customers i have never been treated so poorly by an american internet business before and im confident that any business who treats people in this way wont be in business for long 
maybe my situation was special as i am often abroad but shopify operates as if its customers are not even allowed to take a vacation out of the country if you log in from a certain ip address pool their algorithms go crazy and here comes justin to hit the delete button on your store with one click 
whatever the reason its important for existing and potential shopify customers to know that it doesnt take much for them to shut you down at any moment and for any cause they will take all your information and prevent you from contacting customers or fulfilling orders your only recourse to receive your data is to threaten legal action and that may be no guarantee of success if any of my friends ask me about which web store platform to use i will strongly warn them against shopify

No Author,daesh abducts s near mosul to use them as human shields un,"economic collapse october   
could we see violence no matter who wins on november th lets hope that it doesnt happen but as you will see below antitrump violence is already sweeping the nation 
if trump were to actually win the election that would likely send the radical left into a violent postelection temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before alternatively there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by hillary clinton and as i showed yesterday it appears that voting machines in texas are already switching votes from donald trump to hillary clinton  if hillary clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country 
at this moment there is less than two weeks to go until november th and a brand new survey has found that a majority of americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day 
a  majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on election day one in five are very concerned three of four say they have confidence that the united states will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked american democracy for more than  years but just  say they are very confident about that 
more than four in  of trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of clinton as president if she prevails because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square 
but many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence on wednesday donald trumps star on the walk of fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pickax 
donald trump took a lot of hits today and not just in the presidential race with less than two weeks to go before america decides if the ex apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over hillary clinton trumps star on the hollywood walk of fame was destroyed early wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a tinseltown first 
and there were two other instances earlier this year when donald trumps star was also vandalized one came in january and the other happened in june  
this is of course not the first time the gop candidates star has been attacked or defaced since trump announced his white house bid in summer  the most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at  hollywood blvd in late january in june this summer a mute sign was painted on trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign in both cases trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day 
we have seen antitrump violence on the east coast as well earlier this month someone decided to firebomb the republican party headquarters in orange county north carolina on the building next to the headquarters someone spraypainted nazi republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika 
there have also been other disturbing incidents of antitrump violence all over the nation in recent days a recent lifezette article put together quite a long list and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece 
on oct  in bangor maine vandals spraypainted about  parked cars outside a trump rally trump supporter paul foster whose van was hit with white paint told reporters why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars all of this to make their statement 
around oct  a couple of trump supporters were assaulted in zeitgeist a san francisco bar after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for trump gotnews reports the two trump supporters were attacked punched and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back lilian kim of abc  bay area tweeted a photo of the men in which one was wearing a trump tshirt and the other was wearing a blue lives matter shirt 
on sept  in el cajon california an angry mob at a black lives matter protest beat yearold trump supporter feras jabro for wearing a make america great again baseball cap the assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app periscope 
there is a move to get trump supporters to wear red on election day but in many parts of america that might just turn his supporters into easy targets lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating 
of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad and a hillary clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge 
for example this week former congressman joe walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if donald trump loses the election 
former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald trump is not elected president 
walsh a former tea party congressman from illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host tweeted on november th im voting for trump on november th if trump loses im grabbing my musket you in 
and without a doubt many ordinary americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case hillary clinton is victorious the following comes from usa today  
since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards hillary clinton ive been buying a lot more ammunition says rick darling  an engineer from harrison township in michigans detroit suburbs in a followup phone interview after being surveyed the trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election 
today america is more divided than i have ever seen it before and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another 
ironically donald trump has been working very hard to bring america together in fact he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any republican presidential candidate since   
if hillary clinton and the democrats win on november th things will not go well for hillary clintons political enemies the clintons used the power of the white house to go after their enemies the first time around and hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then 
and the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are this is something that i discussed on national television earlier this month  
as i write this it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a hillary clinton presidency would be

Beau Albrecht,is western civilization worth saving,"with her hollywood and silver screen career options all but dried up former charmed actress and constantly nearnaked attentionseeker rose mcgowan is now a leading feminist as you would expect this transition occurred after her looks which never approached those of costar alyssa milano had well and truly begun to fade mcgowan is not alone in making this spectacular shift pamela anderson and professional sjw natasha devon are among a growing crowd of women who rail against sexism and objectification after years of trying often very successfully to sexualize their youth
seeking to cash in on her newfound fame as an unhinged sjw rose mcgowan launched the rose army a kind of personal cult that tries to hide the overt narcissism of its creator by supporting campaigns against domestic violence and female objectification full sjw mode is just a button away for her for instance she attacked gays for not being feminist enough and probably projecting her jealousy over not landing a significant acting role for an eternity claimed an xmen movie poster promoted violence against women 
so now comes the task of reconciling the new rose mcgowan with the old one whose selfobjectification is best described by this infamous photo with exboyfriend marilyn manson

excuses excuses rose mcgowan has tried to gloss over her past history of selfobjectification and sexualization by saying she was merely a pawn of the patriarchy
mcgowan is now even blaming her past personal feuds such as with a fellow charmed actress shannen doherty on patriarchy sexism and female objectification  sadly this very public attentionseeking in which mcgowan wrote doherty an open letter comes at the same time that the latter is suffering from cancer  but you know a girls gotta attentionwhore including when another girl she used to have catfights with is about to die
rose mcgowan has a lot in common with pamela anderson ex playboy cover model anderson after an entire career made from taking her clothes off and otherwise selling her body as if she were competing for a championship has now come out against pornography  she may not be bad for a gal nearing  but her best years are a good  years behind her i would wager that pamela anderson hit  and spent the last several years in denial before she decided to lambaste an industry currently lauding nubile girls in their twenties and not her pornography addictions are bad but anderson showing these new colors in  is nothing short of a joke
andersons position can be summed up by the following two pictures
time when she did not condemn pornography 

time when she condemns pornography 

previously a lot of attention has been paid to fat or unattractive girls being feminists these activists are nominally against the sexualization of women but appear to be driven primarily by envy and the need to diminish societys praise of attractive females whilst there is a lot of truth to this it only tells part of the story the rank opportunism of feminism is perhaps better explained by women who once made a career from selling their appearances and have subsequently turned on the industries whose financial teats they used to suckle and what better time to turn on these industries whether they be the pornography film or modeling markets than when your looks no longer allow you to actively participate in them
this phenomenon runs parallel to female athletes both utilizing and complaining about their sexualization  attractive tennis players like sabine lisicki and unattractive ones like serena williams have made careers out of wearing revealing oncourt clothing which is much more for show than practicality but when the chance presents itself lisicki and others have moaned like at this years wimbledon  about how manufacturers designs make them show too much skin many of these girls may not have lost their attractiveness yet but they pick and choose when objectification is bad just like celebrities whose looks have abandoned them
its not just famous people natasha devon
many return of kings readers will remember natasha devon from her awful performance against milo yiannopoulos during a british sky news debate on fashion mannequins there seems to have been an eerie timing in devons transition from selfdescribed former model to sjw she founded a socalled body image education program in  in her midtwenties i dont know about you but this seems to be the sort of age when nonfamous models in particular face the meat grinder due to competition from younger fresher girls
as she hurtled towards  natasha devon penned an article for cosmopolitan magazine on bulimia which morphed into a regular monthly column then came the selfesteem team devon created in  frequently with government funding the selfesteem team has essentially applauded obesity britains number one health crisis and sought to reengineer what humans are programmed by evolution to find attractive
devon along with anderson and mcgowan may chalk an antiobjectification epiphany down to age experience or something similarly convenient but the changes happened neither at the height of their selfsexualization careers nor during the prewall protracted slide always be on the look out for when exactly a woman took up feminist or general sjw activism
when a woman complains about the objectification of women it usually means a she never had the goods to begin with b her goods werent enough to compete with other girls or c her goods are well and truly gone there is a delicious irony to option c as countless women will milk their looks until natureor a halfdecade of alcohol or drugfueled benderstakes them away
feminism as projection 
it is par for the course in todays political climate that our enemies describe us as sad mommas boys who play out failed encounters with women through our beliefs of anyone roosh has faced this entirely baseless criticism the most all because our opponents have been unable to actually refute what he and return of kings say
we need to turn this idea of projection against feminists even more than we have before modernday feminism is itself the domain of women seeking easy comforts from an ideology that explains away either their own faults or their most primal fears about a harsh uncertain world for women whose looks are now washedup feminism enables them to label objectification as wrong and soothe the crushing blows that come from no longer getting the attention they were used to
rather than seeing these women as twisted and evil it is better to perceive the behavior for what it is desperation and the shocking realization that they are sexually irrelevant

Jason Easley,trump wrecks any hope gop had of taking advantage of clinton email investigation,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on tue nov st  at  am last springnew york had to take legal action to collect  in unpaid taxes on the trumpowned company that owns the trademark boeing    
we looked yesterday at kurt eichenwalds revelation that donald trump put off investigators for six months while busily destroying emails that is hardly trumps only misdeed but how many people realize that donald trump at this moment has   seventyfive  legal issues hanging over his head 
hes lying  to  times a day and has his followers  and with much less excuse the mainstream media  thoroughly distracted by the clinton email nonstory so he can divert their attention away from his own legally questionable activities 
usa today reported at the end of october that just two weeks before election day at least  of the plus lawsuits involving trump and his businesses remain open according to an ongoing nationwide analysis of state and federal court records by usa today 
it will surprise no one because trump is already deadbeating on his own pollster  that one trump case over nonpayment of tips to caterers at trump soho hotel in new york city is scheduled to go to trial a week before election day 
if one thing has become clear throughout this election it is that trump does not pay his bills earlier we had covered an incident where he had declined to finish paying a florida contractor for work it did on one of his resorts having decided that the contractor had been paid enough even though it wasnt the agreedupon amount trump got nailed by the court for k in attorneys fees in that case 
just a few examples from usa todays investigation 
trump faces significant open litigation tied to his businesses angry members at his jupiter fla golf course say they were cheated out of refunds on their dues and a former employee at the same club claims she was fired after reporting sexual harassment theres a fraud case brought by trump university students who say the moguls company ripped them off for tens of thousands in tuition for a sham real estate course trump is also defending lawsuits tied to his campaign a disgruntled gop political consultant sued for  million saying trump defamed her another suit a class action says the campaign violated consumer protection laws by sending unsolicited text messages 
as pointed out by usa todays nick penzenstadler and john kelly these lawsuits will dog trump into the white house should he win he will have no immunity because he is president and america  and the world  will be treated to the spectacle of the president of the united states having to make trip after trip to the court to settle his highly questionable personal and business affairs 
there are harassment cases sex discrimination lawsuits fraud unpaid bills racist comments defamation cases involving trump university as usa today notes as recently as last springnew york had to take legal action to collect  in unpaid taxes on the trumpowned company that owns the trademark boeing  that jetted the mogul to campaign rallies across the country 
and those  cases will likely grow 
trump has promised after all to sue the new york times and each of the women  nymag maintains an exhaustive list  who have accused him of sexual assault 
usa today says it spent six months researching court records the exclusive analysis they say found an unprecedented mountain of legal battles for a presidential candidate ranging from skirmishes with pageant contestants to multimillion dollar real estate lawsuits the cases offer clues to the leadership style the billionaire would bring to the white house 
donald trump claims clinton is tainted he claims clintons emails are bigger than watergate the other day tweeted  we must not let crookedhillary take her criminal scheme into the oval office draintheswamp 
this comes from the man who would turn the  pennsylvania avenue into a morality nogo zone

Harold Hughes,no title,"state that fired pastor demands his sermons notes this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority published  mins ago bob unruh about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in  after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print dr eric walsh photo first liberty 
the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church 
but dr eric walsh is resisting issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers 
the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations 
hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons 
walshs ordeal began in may  when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency only a week later a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventhday adventist church 
lee rudd the agencys human resources director then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately two days later walsh was fired 
at that point lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks chesin  walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency 
police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the constitution order today 
now in response to walshs lawsuit the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands among a flood of other paperwork copies of his sermon notes and transcripts 
this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church said jeremy dys senior counsel for first liberty 
no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so 
officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general who did not respond to a request for comment 
walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support 
on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code 
wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile filthy blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen 
the mayor at the time annise parker withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest  
in a prepared statement wednesday on walshs case welch said i cant believe im saying this but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded  different categories of materials including sermons from  us 
welch the executive director of the texas pastor council said what is happening to walsh is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons 
first this is state government coming after a pastor not just a rogue mayor in one city he said also the state is demanding much more material sermons sermon notes all documents without even topical or time limits it could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching bible its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study this sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor every church every denomination and every citizen of faith in america 
leaders of concerned women for america legislative action committee part of the nations largest public policy womens group with  members also came to walshs defense 
penny nance ceo said the words of reverend dr martin luther king jr that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere still reverberate today  especially as we witness the gestapolike tactics of his native state the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom as they discriminate against another pastor dr eric walsh is indeed a threat to every american whatever our religious beliefs 
can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor examine and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share 
wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed walshs sermons and then fired him 
no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon dys told fox news when the case was filed he was fired for something he said in a sermon if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything the original state investigation of walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist 
state officials also joked about informing walsh of his firing 
the telephone call was between dr patrick oneal an agency official and kate pfirman an agency financial officer the call was captured on an answering machine which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up 
pfirman said and im gonna be very  im gonna try to come off as very cold because i dont want to say very much if i try to make it warm  ive thought that through its gonna just not  theres no warm way to say it anyway 
then there was laughter from both parties 
oneal then said to inform walsh youre out and there was another round of laughter 
its very funny pfirman said

Jim,hoping for the best and preparing for the worst a look inside the american redoubt movement,"oregon live 
juror  vigorously defends the acrosstheboard acquittals of ammon bundy and his six codefendants calling the rulings a statement about the prosecutions failure to prove the fundamental elements of a conspiracy charge 
the fulltime marylhurst university business administration student was the juror who had sent a note to the judge on the fourth day of the initial jurys deliberations in the case questioning the impartiality of a fellow juror no  who the judge bounced from the jury a day later 
it should be known that all  jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove conspiracy in the count itself  and not any form of affirmation of the defenses various beliefs actions or aspirations juror  wrote friday in a lengthy email to the oregonianoregonlive 
he expressed relief that he can now speak out freely but he wasnt ready as of friday morning to drop his anonymity he said his studies have suffered since the trial started and hes not ready for the attention revealing his identity would bring but felt it was important to defend the verdict the judge withheld jurors names during the jury selection process and trial instead referring to each by number 
the jury closely followed us district judge anna j browns instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence and testimony heard during the fiveweek trial he said 
the jury returned unanimous verdicts of not guilty to conspiracy charges against all seven defendants each was accused of conspiring to prevent employees of the us fish and wildlife service and bureau of land management from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force during the day occupation 
juror  noted the panel couldnt simply rely on the defendantsdefining actions to convict 
all  agreed that impeding existed even if as an effect of the occupation he wrote 
but we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings rather to decide if any agreement was made with an illegal object in mind the marylhurst student wrote it seemed this basic high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout 
prosecutors had argued that the case at its core was about the illegal taking of anothers property the heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the day takeover in and of itself was intimidating and prevented officers from the us fish and wildlife service and us bureau of land management from carrying out their work they said 
they argued that the alleged conspiracy began nov  when ammon bundy and ally ryan payne met with harney county sheriff dave ward and promised there would be extreme civil unrest in the community if he didnt step in and block harney county ranchers dwight hammond jr and steven hammond the hammonds were slated to return to federal prison on jan  and serve out a mandatory minimum fiveyear sentence for arson on federal land 
defense lawyers urged jurors in closing arguments not to mixup the effect of the occupation  which undoubtedly kept federal employees from doing their jobs  from the intent of the occupiers 
five of the seven defendants including ammon bundy testified many said that they were there to protest in support of the hammonds and federal government overreach because they received absolutely no response from state or local government officials to their previous efforts to spur change 
the defense lawyers arguments coupled with the jury instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence resonated with jurors juror  noted 
inference while possibly compelling proved to be insulting or inadequate to  diversely situated people as a means to convict the juror wrote the air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us nor was it warranted given their burden of proof 
juror  plainly stated that fellow juror  during the initial round of deliberations had zero business being on this jury in the first place 
juror  had worked for the us bureau of land management as a ranch tech and firefighter more than  years ago he had said during jury selection asked by the judge during voir dire if that experience would impede his ability to be a fair and impartial judge of the facts he said not really 
juror  explained why he didnt alert the court immediately after he had heard juror  on day one of deliberations reportedly say i am very biased 
it wasnt until the fourth day into deliberations that juror  sent a note to the court asking if a juror who had worked previously for the federal land management agency and outright told the panel he was very biased could be an impartial judge the court flummoxed by the development a day later dismissed juror  for good cause after the prosecution and defense teams agreed to the dismissal at the time parties to the case werent sure which way juror s alleged bias fell 
juror  said he resisted the impulse to send the question sooner in an effort to give his fellow juror a chance to explain himself 
in his email to the oregonianoregonlive juror  for the first time also contended that juror  violated the judges explicit orders by hearkening to evidence that was never admitted in this case refused to consider the defendants state of mind and used imaginative theories to explain key actions 
juror  said though he wishes that he had sent the letter on day one since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us 
the maryville business student said he is baffled by what he described as observersflippant sentiments in the wake of the jurys acquittals 
dont they know that not guilty does not mean innocent he wrote it was not lost on us that our verdicts might inspire future actions that are regrettable but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us 
the jury he said met with judge brown after the verdicts were announced and after the us marshals physical confrontation and arrest of bundy lawyer marcus mumford 
he said many of the jurors questioned the judge about why the federal government chose the conspiracy charge he said he learned that a potential alternate charge such as criminal trespass wouldnt have brought as significant a penalty 
the charge of conspiring to impede federal employees from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force brings a maximum sentence of six years in prison 
we all queried about alternative charges that could stick and were amazed that this conspiracy charge seemed the best possible option juror  said

Activist Post,new alaska law taking first step against common core,"by john vibes 
in the midst of deepening tension between us allies nato and russia nato is planning the largest military buildup along the russian border since the cold war 
nato called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort according to reuters  thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks 
it was reported that italy france denmark and other european states are expected to join the nato military divisions that will be led by the united states along russias border 
on wednesday britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to russias borders as part of a huge military deployment 
a total of  troops drones and tanks are moving to estonia as part of the biggest military buildup of nato troops on russias borders since the cold war 
in addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation nato has an army of over  ready to be called up to fight at any time 
the us military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a deterrent to the russian military but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war 
this is a credible deterrence not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg said on tuesday  ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation 
just imagine what would happen if russian troops amassed along the mexican border and told the us that this move was to prevent conflict 
the socalled iskanderm cruise missiles can hit targets across poland and the baltics although nato officials declined to say if russia had moved nuclear warheads to kaliningrad 
the united states envoy to nato douglas lute told reporters that nato and the us military may consider russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of natos deployment this statement is insane considering the fact that the us military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone elses lands 
this deployment if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed would be a change in russias security posture lute said 
if anyone is a threat it is nato and the us government 
these military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in syria in which western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups meanwhile russia has interests in keeping their allies in the syrian government in control putting the two superpowers at odds 
until now russia and the us have been fighting through third parties just as they had during the previous cold war and the same type of situation is developing today

Mike Rivero,hillary clinton supporters now calling for a recount of votes in battleground states,"while richard spencers halfjoke of hailing donald trump with r oman salute rose a lot of dust some remarks in his npi speech point into rather sinister direction a posthuman one 
transcript with references and additional av material 
undoubtedly there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when hillary clinton lost presidential elections to donald trump if for nothing else then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears because racism homophobia xenophobia and whateverphobia it was a joy and a relief because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism  dubbed political correctness to be a paper tiger 
however party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance as sjw s are hopefully moving out from the spotlight of posthistorical stage the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image if we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn this image will be just as ugly  and just as unreal  as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct  shitlib  
in the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the alternative right movement richard spencer in the future we are to deal with the leadership of children of the sun 
this is an interesting and to my mind quite worrisome statement of intent  a manifestation of will as spencer would doubtless rectify me  pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal  and quite unidirectional  circular movement of the pagan deity revered by all selfrespecting übermenschen  from nietzsche to postmodern occultists 
however theres a deeper astrotheological metaphor at work here the pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy nietzsche in its virtual postmodern installment is not to be strictly represented by swastika  as spencer apparently assumes but by other only seemingly ancient symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and pc gaming and turned into ideological brand by russian philosopher alexander dugin or his minions an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement 
the symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement not of sun but of presumably primordial origin of everything chaos 
in the lines to follow well provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation the channeling of chaos principle  and adjacent chaos logic  through loosely knit alt right movement taking as a starting point some statements from spencers speech held at npi conference in washington dc on november  st  

triumph of the will or hipster babylon working 

in introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right embodied in the election of donald trump spencer makes one interesting remark 
but even though we always took trump seriously there was still a moment of unreality  or perhaps too painfully intense reality  when the state of pennsylvania was called for donald trump the moment when we knew kek had smiled upon us that meme magic was real and though these terms are used halfjokingly they represent something truly importantthe victory of will  we willed donald trump into office made this dream into reality  
it is all delivered in a manner of an injoke not to be taken too seriously moreover to the uninitiated into mysteries of this internet movement it is probably unclear who is kek and what exactly is meme magic 
well start our explanation with lesser weirdness 
meme is an expression denoting inexistent existent coined apparently by richard dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology memes are thoughts expressed in image andor phrase which by circulation in public acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to infect the consciousness with their messages like viruses meme is inexistent because theres no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based selfsubsistence and ability to procreate like viruses images andor phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial yet they quite paradoxically exist because analogy apparently works  however no one seems to pose the question why it works 
well it works because it is magical 

chaos magick 

here we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern  in fact posthumanist  vein resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can  and should  be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution if artificial construct is in line with principle of evolution it is real or to be more precise it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle it is imagined into existence  
therefore meme magick works only insofar it relies upon artificial preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with memes as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs 
the goal of practitioner of such magic  a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic  is to change the world according to his will this is more or less what is known from the seventies of the last century as chaos magick  a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in subhuman and subnatural domain of the world in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it the peculiarity of chaos magick is on the one hand that it is entirely syncretic ie that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe with intended subjective meaning and that it relies on virtual ie artificial world of mass culture now embodied above all in internet 
the idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible  
there are many interesting implications to this 
the first is that everything is interrelated ie that everything is connected with everything else so any which way you take youll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough the second is that theres no hierarchy of higher and lower  theres only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements dissolving in turn into nothingness if concentrated upon as theres nothing higher theres nothing to be revered and everything can  and indeed should  be an object of ironical laughter and most importantly this is the world of dreams ruled by what is usually called dream logic but in actual fact chaos logic or unlogic  
in this sense richard spencer quite accurately proclaimed trumps victory an accomplishment of meme or chaos magick 
trump is willed into office by internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality  virtual reality one may add yet reality nonetheless the fact that trump was elected for a plethora of motives  from the appeal of his politics to public takedown of hillary clinton by wikileaks  is immaterial because in the world of chaos every subjective reality tunnel or interpretation of the world is as real as any other 
in this sense we can observe new god emperor of usa as a magical creation of internet by the internet and for the internet  today still the internet of interconnected computer nodes but soon probably the internet of things if one is to push spencers remark to its logical extreme we can assert that illustrious donald is the worlds first president of posthuman race an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra antiprogressive group 
so that was lesser weirdness let us proceed now to high weirdness 


we owe the reader an answer to a question who the hell is kek 
well the reason why spencer mentions him is again a magickal halfjoke kek is interpreted to be an ancient egyptian deity by a number of internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar  pepe the frog while i habitually suspend judgment on all things egyptian because ancient egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts i consider this interpretation upon closer inspection to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic 
namely pepe the cartoon character conceived in  by cartoonist matt furie emerged as a meme from the depths of internet forums more precisely chan subforum pol devoted to political discussions with no holds barred which was in view of some observers a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados a place of absolute freedom therefore absolute chaos 
the expression kek was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the injoke among the players of world of warcraft  replacing the standard internet abbreviation lol laughing out loud someone eventually noticed that kek is in fact the name of frogheaded egyptian deity signifying chaos and darkness and pepe was rebranded as kek the deity  ironic one no doubt half joking one as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it but deity nonetheless 
it is important to point out that in view of the most esoteric kekists that is half grinning faithful of kekpepe the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities  causally unrelated meaningful relations among events so it came to pass that kek sounds very similar to cuckoriginally cuckservative a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not red pilled another meme taken from pop culture shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists by alt right or should we assume kek himself furthermore hillary clinton addressed pepe as nothing less than public enemy identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character then it happened that after this act hillary fainted in front of the cameras and that was immediately interpreted as an action of kek 
a good rundown of kekpepetrump identification 
however it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on pol subforum 
one last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture dubs 
every post on chan and similar venues comes with an digit numerical stamp this number represents that posts entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard 
with the amount of traffic these sites get the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll when a poster gets repeated digits its called dubs trips quads and so on 
since a poster cant know their post number until after theyve submitted the post its common for people to bet the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits  when that endeavor proves a successful a get has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated 
out of this practice a strange phenomenon began to take place on pol discussion threads associated with trump displayed noticeably frequent gets it wasnt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture pepe the frog now pols unofficial mascot donald trump pols overwhelming candidate of choice repeating digit post numbers gets kek used as an expression of delight particular in response to trumps trolling of the establishment as well as in reaction to unlikely gets in general 
and a god was born  source  

synchronicities related to emergence of kek the god and his merging with trump in the bowels of internet forums early on in the presidential campaign are so numerous and frankly mind boggling that we cannot list them here for the sake of brevity for our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados including core leadership kek is the god and trump is his prophet all declared with smug grin and ironical stance yet with all the necessary power of conviction 
namely chaos magick relies on laughter or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially unprincipled fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its practitioner to impose his own will and change the world  as spencer would put it make his dreams a reality 
i would go further and add make all reality a dream  because chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual ie posthuman  world the idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism  in its essence however it is a complete opposite a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles  above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of being  into nothingness of primordial chaos 

posthuman traditionalism 

i already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of alexander dugin who is probably the most consequent subverter of tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age but now we can see how his affiliates in usa and europe are doing the same thing  with less philosophical subtlety but fueled by much greater raw power namely alt right if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition  something richard spencer likes to call political theology  founded on new age filtered aryan myths  racial interpretation of nietzsche and generally crossbred with do your own thing mentality all done in the virtual ether of information technology after all if we are to agree with spencer  half jokingly of course  that god emperor was inaugurated by the act of kek the god then the victory of alt right traditionalists is in fact the victory of technological magic the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand ray kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics  
in the end therefore we are talking about another victory of posthumanism branded spontaneously or otherwise as traditionalism the obsession of alt right adherents with identity in general and white identity in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of tradition they supposedly defend they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted  observing the plethora of various rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard from macho gay postmodern spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic  and to a large extent made up  pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator save maybe for quite unchallenged neodarwinist stance especially to be found among game bloggers as chateau heartiste  if someone thinks that he can reattach himself to premodern spiritual history of humankind  actually the only one there is  while at the same time musing about alpha and beta males sexual market signaling and countersignaling professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental gmo of memes genes and biological analogies he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends 
the allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the west induced by process of globalization yet this is an eristic or to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine discordian dialectic the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of chaos it is all done with the crooked half grin a pinch of salt to every smug remark  with irony of the man who knows hes a liar and a cheat but smug humor goes just a short way in the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend far more effectively than dead serious pc brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for 
well end with the word of warning to christian adherents of alt right the words have a definite meanings and power theres only one chaos and theres only one bringer of light from chaos  as some kek worshipers already defined the poor frogs main job  and its not the one to be defined as god from god light from light but god from gutter light from darkness a real darkness shining in virtual brightness hope you guess his name 
so without a pinch of irony i declare be careful who your hail

likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole  our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack  two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july    two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online uk july   needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegal alien gang rape at all by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape  why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam  reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe thats hillarys dream if she wins joe sobrans parody of the typical new york times headline about anything will come true women and minorities

Corey Savage,how the elites are using divide and rule to control us,"since we were children we have been bombarded with propaganda that romantic love is the ultimate relationship ideal hollywood movies disney cartoons and literary fiction all portray romantic love as an absolute necessity in any wedding union but how much of that narrative has been a lie is it possible that our pursuit of romantic love is actually preventing us from forming a lifelong pair bond
i began to question the notion of romantic love when thinking about its emotional root love is a fleeting emotion and like all emotions it comes and goes like the clouds in the sky why have i been taught to select my life partner based on an emotion im surely not encouraged to use emotion when buying a house applying for a job or doing my personal finances but when it comes to choosing a human being that im supposed to spend the rest of my life with im advised by the establishment narrative to use emotion for the biggest decision of them all
another major clue that romantic love is a childish strategy for choosing mates is the fact that countries with arranged marriages where partners are picked based on purely practical matters have lower divorce rates that in countries where romantic love is used to select mates        while there are multiple reasons for divorce in any society it is rather coincidental that the countries most impacted by notions of romantic love happen to have the highest divorce rates 
romance was invented 
it turns out that your desire to use love as a precondition for marriage or pair bonding is an invented construct that had roots in destroying tradition and theistic authority romanticism a movement that began in the th century put romantic love at the forefront not just for individuals but nations as well all from a central thesis of individualism it wanted you to take the focus away from boring old rules and traditions to focusing on how you feel 
the movement came primarily from bourgeois youth who used family money to fiddle away on idealistic writings
the romantic movement was nothing more than a protest against bourgeois conventions bourgeois society and morality to be extreme and flamboyant and unusual and violent even at the risk of becoming grotesque was the desire of every young romantic the romantics were in fact bourgeois origins who were trying hard to escape from their own shadows  source 
 romantics believed that men and women ought to be guided by warm emotions rather than the cold abstract rules and rituals established by bourgeois society  source 
they sound a lot like modern day social justice warriors  many of whom are trust fund babies that lash out against privilege and inequality to relieve the psychological pain of being wealthy without having had to earn it combined with the fact that sjws also trump feelings over logic its clear to see how romanticists were protosjws whose individualistic ideas are just what the enlightenment needed to complete its destruction of tradition
romantics redefined what relationships should be based on 
prior to the romantic era companionate love was the relationship form often described in literature and other historical writings
passionate love is the arousaldriven emotion which often gives people extreme feelings of happiness and can also give people feelings of anguish companionate love is the form which creates a steadfast bond between two people and gives people feelings of peace scientists have described the stage of passionate love as being on cocaine since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter dopamine as when cocaine is being used  source 
besides song of songs in the old testament  writers were not encouraged to muse endlessly about passionate love and there is zero evidence it was used as the principal factor in forming new marriages but its this passionate love that were told to strive for of feeling like youve been swept up in an exciting whirlwind before publishing the gory details on buzzfeed or in a bestseller like eat pray love authored by a woman who is embarking on her second divorce 
women of the romantic era played a big part in elevating romantic love and why wouldnt they its much more fun to get swept up in the excitement created by noncommittal alpha male than it does to do arduous daily duties before you husband king and god women were given the chance to pick between excitement or responsibility and we know what they have chosen
the works of the romantic era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period the romantic period saw an increase in female authors and also female readers  source 
the modern era has doubled down on the notion of romantic love jewish psychologist robert sternberg proposed the popular triangular theory of love  which is often used today as defining the love ideal this theory has caused immense harm for stating that all three forms of love are needed in equal measure for a successful relationship

anyone who takes an introductory psychology course or who reads a pop psychology book will be exposed to this theory and walk away thinking that passion is absolutely required in a relationship if its not there the presumption is that the relationship is no longer consummate and far short of ideal
believing that romantic love and passion are necessary in a marriage makes it that much easier to exit out of it because when a woman no longer feels passion she will walk away knowing that experts like sternberg would agree that the relationship degraded and was no longer worth saving and this is exactly what modern women are doing in droves they have shown an appalling disregard for their wedding vows especially upon realizing that they initiate  of divorces 
romanticism and the rise of nationalism 
if nationalism came out of the romantic era and passionate love was a mistake does that mean nationalism is also a mistake
one of romanticisms key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism which became a central theme of romantic art and political philosophy from the earliest parts of the movement with their focus on development of national languages and folklore and the importance of local customs and traditions to the movements that would redraw the map of europe and lead to calls for selfdetermination of nationalities nationalism was one of the key vehicles of romanticism its role expression and meaning
 patriotism nationalism revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period  source 
upon closer inspection its easy to see that the ruling agenda of today globalism  is essentially world nationalism instead of loving your neighbor and only those who share your unique traditions or race youre supposed to love everyone in the world  because its evil to think that there are large differences between a german businessman in a hugo boss suit and a tutsi villager with a lip plate the size of a grapefruit
the romantic ideal of nationalism is not adolph hitler but george soros  who insists on loving everyone in the world from the depths of your heartfelt human compassion a nationalism based on genetics and local bonds will no doubt serve citizens better than a global nationalism where youre supposed to care for those who are nothing like you
how should men choose their life partners 
its clear that using romantic love and passion as your primary standard for longterm relationships will lead to failure and maybe even personal catastrophe youll easily come to this conclusion by evaluating your past relationships and the mistakes youve made on women who you had intense passion for
instead practicality must be the order of the day you must logically evaluate any woman you intend to be with for more than a casual relationship by weighing her values beliefs and sexual history this is easier said than done because weve been so brainwashed to believe passion is important but it simply makes the most amount of sense find a woman the same way you would find a new job or buy a new house and be wary of women who picked you based more on passion than practical matters
it may sound cold to search for your wife like you would a business partner but that is exactly what she is the daytoday life of a family home is far more business and economics than love and so you should come to the easy conclusion that thats what you must use to form a stable home
understand however that we do not live in a traditional and patriarchal society that aids us in our search for a virtuous woman instead society is encouraging women to corrupt themselves sexually and physically in the name of empowerment and independence making our search exceedingly difficult this is one of the costs we have to pay for living in the modern world some men will be able to overcome it but many men wont and will fail in their search for a woman they can create a family with
but at least we are now armed with the knowledge of what it takes to have a more successful longterm relationship its not romantic love or butterflies in the stomach but a matter of practicality logically evaluate her past her values and her beliefs to make sound predictions of how shell behave in the future from this evaluation will come a logical decision that is likely to endure instead of relying on emotion which changes as readily as the direction of the wind

admin,defense board white house blocked navy from s china sea warship passages,"liberty blitzkrieg october   
the name peter kadzik probably doesnt ring a bell for many of you although it probably should this guy is a real piece of work as an excellent article published earlier today at the daily caller demonstrates 
heres some of what we learned 
the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta the democrats campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik a top official at the justice department 
the dinner arrangement revealed in hacked podesta emails released by wikileaks is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices 
podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 
the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server says matthew whitaker the executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust a government watchdog group 
kadzik who started at the doj in  helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president 
kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office 
in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign 
podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 
podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by independent counsel kenneth starr for the investigation but he defended the falsehoods saying later that he was merely relaying false information from clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time 
he did lie to me podesta said about clinton in a national public radio interview in  clinton was acquitted by the senate in feb  of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the lewinsky probe 
kadzik then a lawyer with the firm dickstein shapiro morin  oshinsky represented podesta through the fiasco 
podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal 
kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon 
to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   
a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta 
the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon 
on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library 
the first mention of personal contact between podesta and kadzik in the wikileaks dump is in an oct   email sent out by vincent roberti a lobbyist who is close to podesta and his superlobbyist brother tony podesta in it roberti refers to a dinner reservation at posto a washington dc restaurant 
the dinner was set for  that evening just a day after clinton gave  hours of testimony to the benghazi committee 
podesta and kadzik met several months later for dinner at podestas home another email shows  and in an email sent on may   kadziks son asked podesta for a job on the clinton campaign 
ill have the lobster risotto with a side of cronyism and middle class destruction 
as head of the office of legislative affairs kadzik handles inquiries from congress on a variety of issues in that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the clinton investigation 
the justice department and fbi have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation which concluded in july with no charges filed against clinton 
but kadzik worked on other clinton email issues in his dealings with congress 
last november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation 
seems like a pretty important decision for a clinton crony to make 
the justice department declined to comment on the record for this article 
could the department of injustice have any less credibility

the whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from clintons campaign chair john podesta on a daily basis since early october assange claimed the release whipped up a crazed hornets nest atmosphere in the hillary clinton campaign leading them to attack wikileaks 
they attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the un and british courts to accuse me of being both a russian spy and a pedophile he added

assange who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference said he did not agree with ecuadors decision but did understand it wikileaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from ecuador he said 
he did however reject the idea that wikileaks is interfering with the us election claiming this is not the interference of electoral process this is the definition of electoral process  for media organizations and in fact everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring it cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform

a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law 
alabamas judges are elected and accountable wrote justice tom parker this week federal judges as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v hodges  a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to samesex marriage are unaccountable and unelected 
he pointed out that three of the four dissenting us supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were consequently unaccountable 
parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning history tradition the courts own rules or the rule of law but upon their empathetic feelings 
obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges he said 
he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriagebased case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case which created samesex marriage nationwide was announced 
moore who is challenging the punishment insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves they did with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments 
parker said active judges should have been included in the panel because retired judges too are unelected and unaccountable 
unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda instead of faithfully applying the rule of law parker warned obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided obergefell the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states 
dont miss phyllis schlaflys book now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family 
before obergefell  states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in  of those states the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the  state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts  of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the  courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable 
he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account citing the situation that developed in iowa 
the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa however although the judges are initially appointed they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires 
he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law in april  in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional 
the very next year three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa this was the first time since iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law 
mathew staver chairman of of liberty counsel which is representing moore said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case 
chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law he said 
the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every turn this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the  vote never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule  has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right 
supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart who has been acting as alabamas chief justice 
she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore 
the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization 
if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary they will no doubt take our complaint seriously as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore said tom ford a spokesman for the group 
the complaints the group said outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety failed to perform the duties of her office impartially failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary 
parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary 
daniel horowitz  senior editor at conservative review told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation 
it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues whether its the bureaucrats whether its the courts and as it relates to even religious liberty even property rights immigration our voting rights who gets to vote he said 
horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america 
how did we get here horowitz asked rhetorically and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges the legal profession and unelected bureaucrats that is social transformation without representation which as scalia warned is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution 
samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in  by the bare  majority made up of anthony kennedy ruth ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan john roberts clarence thomas samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it 
the majority found in the constitution a right to samesex marriage overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states 
it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the us supreme court majority 
for one two of the justices in the majority kagan and ginsburg were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality without their votes the case would have gone the other way 
they refused 
then there was the us supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier in the defense of marriage act case in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage 
and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people 
as wnd reported  ginsburg who voted in favor of samesex marriage has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements justice elena kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm 
critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest 
the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case but they refused to acknowledge the request the foundation explained that canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court  usc sec a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned 
rabbi jonathan cahn author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah  judgment movie has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage 
at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation 
washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained 
justices can you judge the ways of god there is another court and there is another judge where all men and all judges will give account he warned 
if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal he said

the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling samesex marriage an intrinsic evil 
and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court 
wnd also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of washington  lee boston college kansas state notre dame university of texas villanova vanderbilt hillsdale university of nebraska catholic university and regent university issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the supreme courts recent creation of samesex marriage as anticonstitutional and illegitimate 
it cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the united states said the statement from the american principles project  
we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case to recognize the authority of states to define marriage and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell",wnd.com,Real,english,97.12303591710229,90.07139083078093,13,2,12236,1977,5.151745068285281,1977.0,-1.496929886894355,-1.5173329014319723,2.4491935091181585,2.321350070529188,0.0618027381749381,2.3872197436995624,0.0015174506828528,0.0,0.0015174506828528,0,0,0.0,0.00268704487468,0.998,0.133,0.095,0.771,Positive,Very Strong

ayatollah khamenei has stated that genuine freedom of thought will help the country to progress in the absence of a free intellectual atmosphere there can be no opportunity for growth how do you as a professor perceive it
i reflected very selfconsciously on the prospects of contributing to the progress of my country canada when i opted in the mid to late s to go to graduate school at the university of toronto with the great canadian historian jms careless as my phd supervisor i made a commitment to study the history of colonial relations with the first nations of canada my course of study took me in  to my first appointment in the native studies department at the university of sudbury the university of sudbury was in those years a jesuitrun entity it formed the institutional seed from which the secular laurentian university would emerge in the decades prior to my appointment there
for the next two decades i was able to work from my academic bases in sudbury and then in lethbridge alberta beginning in  at the invitation of the leroy little bear the chair of the department of native american studies i thus moved to the resourcerich province of alberta once again i was motivated to make the transition in my professional work with the hope my i could contribute constructively to the progress of our country from an academic base in western canada
in my years as a young professor i took an active part in four first nationsfirst ministers conferences that took place in ottawa between  and  the purpose of these conferences was to negotiate a constitutional amendment to give greater definition to the phrase  the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of canada are hereby recognized and affirmed section  constitution act  
more the bnai brith and the history of the mounting assault on academic freedom in canadian universities creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere section  was part of the text of the instrument facilitating the movement of authority over canadas constitutional structure from the british imperial mother country to the domestic institutions of canadian federalism
the culmination of my contributions to the formulation of a madeincanada version of the canadian constitution involved my opposition between  and  to what became known as the meech lake accord if this political deal between canadas first ministers had become constitutional law the first nations of canada would have been excluded from a very powerful legal definition of canadas fundamental characteristic
in academic essays in the mainstream media and in presentations to various legislative committees i contributed to public awareness of the negative implications of the meech lake accord for fairminded canadians supportive of existing aboriginal and treaty rights more specifically i contributed to the strength of the platform from which an ojicree parliamentarian by the name of elijah harper used his veto power in the manitoba legislature to block the ratification of the meech lake accord because of elijah harpers actions the meech lake accord did not become part of canadas supreme law
i was able to contribute to discourse crucial to the progress of canada until about the year  between  and  i had to adjust my work away from the activities of the department of native american studies towards a field of my own making globalization studies i prepared two academic volumes to lay the academic foundation and methodological framework for my transition to a new academic role the core focus of my emphasis on globalization studies was indigenous peoples in encounter with colonialism globally from  until the present
it is in this context and with the encouragement of my very accomplished student joshua blakeney that i began to shift focus towards the treatment of palestinian and other arab peoples in the region of greater israel eretz israel it was joshua who also led me to my first interactions with iranian journalists resulting in my participation in the new horizon conference of the autumn of  as i have described in writing elsewhere this episode proved to make a major positive impact on me
due to the intervention of my colleague the mohawk activist splitting the sky i also began to see the events of  as a major factor in the shaping of the global geopolitics in the twentyfirst century
my quest for new academic turf at the has sometimes been bumpy and contested certainly many major obstacles were put in the way of my promotion to full professor eventually my academic peers were allowed to make their input into the promotion process apart from the artificial blockages thrown up by my university administration in  after what i took to be my obtaining a position of intellectual and professional security as a senior faculty member i resolved that henceforth i would pursue difficult lines of research and publication i made this decision with an understanding that less secure younger colleagues might eschew such a course of action
i have made no secret of the fact that i see the recent surrender of the high ground of academic freedom by the members of the administration of the as an indicator that canada is on a downwards spiral it seems to me there is a move a foot to sabotage the intellectual freedom of our universities if academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure
the first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students they will have to deal with the fact that the treatment visited on me indicates it has become dangerous to ask pointed questions which might produce answers embarrassing to power our country canada cannot progress to higher levels of discourse and achievement under these repressive conditions
ayatollah khamenei believes exchanging viewpoints and opinions are in the nature of academic work how is this principle practiced at lethbridge university
i agree that exchanging viewpoints and opinions is a central aspect of academic work within universities and between universities i found that there was a good deal of openness to the exchange of information and ideas with colleagues media and public officials in the years between  and  when the core of my academic work revolved around the history of canadafirst nations relations
unfortunately i would have to say that the obstacles to the exchange of information and ideas began to mount significantly after  when i began to question the official narrative of what happened on  who really did what to whom during the initiating events of what soon became known as the global war on terror as i began to become skeptical of the official narrative i noticed more and more inclination on the part of colleagues to distance themselves from the subjects that captured my professional interest to put it bluntly i suppose it became clear to me that for a number of reasons it was not a good career move for younger colleagues to show interest in the subject of  specifically and false flag terrorism more generally
as i began to look more deeply into the existing research on  i was simultaneously drawn to the subject of war crimes and international law my collaboration with splitting the sky became more intense when we went to work to organize in response to the decision of the former us president george w bush to give a talk in calgary in  as his first public engagement as theoretically a regular civilian citizen our collective action in calgary in the spring of  led to a trial that we dubbed splitting the sky versus george w bush  although i had not yet associated the lies and crimes of  with israel first protagonists i ran into my first zionist pushback for my  studies when i presented my essay should george w bush be arrested in calgary alberta to be tried for international crimes i originally presented the paper at an invited talk at the university of winnipeg
my essay eventually ended up as an exhibit in the litigation that we referred to as splitting the sky versus george w bush  our stance was that the former us president should have been arrested in canada for being a crediblyaccused war criminal we were far from alone in bringing forward evidence that bush had violated many international covenants and conventions against for instance prohibited torture not only had he arguably violated international law but it seemed the former us president had violated canadas own crimes against humanity and war crimes act  the legislation had passed through parliament with the view that canada should not become a haven for war criminals
in pursuing this line of analysis i faced my first allegations that somehow my academic inquiry was antisemitic
as i worked on this subject one that i integrated into my pedagogy it became clear to me that we have never seen anything but victors justice when it comes to the enforcement of international law against those that commit war crimes crimes against humanity crimes against the peace and crimes against democracy it seems that only those on the losing side of military conflicts are ever brought to justice those on the winning side the stronger side are invariably held to be above the law
this line of scholarly investigation did result in various channels of academic exchange opening up for me with colleagues in my own university and other universities the most fruitful collaboration to develop however was that with dr kevin barrett who had lost his academic position at the university of wisconsin for incorporating related subjects into his research and pedagogy
for sure i should not be made to feel so alone in the academy when it comes to the study of  the most transformative event of the twentyfirst century in my view the academic institutions in north america and europe have failed abysmally in the study of false flag terrorism starting with the events of  i am particularly appalled by how this failure on the part of our institutions of higher learning has contributed to the rise of islamophobia as the necessary psychological condition giving license to those promoting the invasions of muslimmajority countries
in a meeting with president rouhani and his cabinet the leader of the islamic revolution said when it comes to caricatures insulting the sanctities of islam the west suddenly becomes an advocates of freedom and the freedom of expression however when it comes to the holocaust there is no freedom of expression why do you think we witness such double standards
a gross display of double standards plagues the ethnocentric way freedom is being defined in the socalled west the psychological operations attending the we are charlie hebdo ceremonies on paris in early  epitomized the hypocrisy the whole essence of this strange event in the city of lights seemed to signal that freedom of speech and expression in the west is virtually limitless when it comes to demeaning through cartoons of prophet mohammed as well as other sacred symbols of islamic religion the other side of the same coin are the many prohibitions imposed on for instance the french comedian mbala mbala dieudonné dieudonné was barred from entering canada for his efforts to make humor of the paranoid state of affairs attending any public references to jews jewish institutions or the activities of israel these days
one of my discoveries through this period of crisis is the fact that the thought police agents in the bnai brith equate my call for open debate on the holocaust and indeed open debate on all subjects as the equivalent of socalled holocaust denial how many of my colleagues at the and in other universities have bent before the harsh intimidation how many have made themselves proponents of shutting down open debate and allowing censorship from outside the academy to regulate our research teaching and publication
there is a controversial quote from ayatollah khamenei in which he says may god curse all those who put an end to political thoughts work and endeavor in universities whats your take on that how essential do you think such a perspective is for the academia
i agree wholeheartedly with the supreme leaders observation one of the great gifts of the creator to humans is the gift of reason and rationality our application of reason and rationality to our understanding of society will inevitably contribute to political thought work and endeavor

EdJenner,chelsea for president,"this is the best picture in human history by november   
this is the best picture in human history 
it is the best picture in human history because it tells the entire tale of both parties the republic and why we are where we are 
on the left side of this picture we have donald trump  a reality television star and lifelong vulgarian the new presidentelect of the united states he points his fingers and smiles that apprentice smile as he makes a point 
on the right side of this picture we have barack obama  a man who considered himself a paragon of dignity and rectitude who thought of himself as a transformative figure and an intellectual giant he sits next to the man who maintained for years that his birth certificate was a fraud the man who has the opportunity to undo virtually his entire agenda within the first month of his assumption of office and obama rightly looks like a man with a pole shoved so far up his rectum that the glint of steel is visible behind his eyes 
behind obama sits a bust of abraham lincoln his eyes downcast mourning for his country 
yep 
greatest picture ever 
this is a picture of justice done and karma ascendant barack obamas image of himself is not accurate  to americans obama is a reality tv show star he transformed the presidency from a dignified office into a selfiestick celebrityridden sinkhole of hollywood glitterati hobnobbing with glozell and macklemore cracking wise about the presidency with jimmy kimmel before saying that a reality star like trump could never be president 
this picture looks like the chickens coming home to roost as obamas former pastor might put it 
and then theres lincoln 
lincoln who gave his life and spent his presidency building the groundwork for racial toleration mourning behind barack obama who has spent his presidency polarizing for electoral gain 
lincoln who represented wisdom mourning behind a clown as the clown gestures to the assembled crowd given republicans domination of the senate and the congress i have hopes for trumps presidency  i hope he keeps his promises and that he becomes a better man and a wonderful president and believe he has every obligation to fulfill his conservative campaign promises  but trump occupying lincolns office is at best a jarring visual

Alex Ansary,julian assange to speak prerecorded rt interview,"crack in earths magnetic shield detected  
dna india 
the worlds largest and most sensitive cosmic ray monitor located in india has recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays that indicates a crack in the earths magnetic shield according to scientists 
the burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona struck earth at a very high speed causing massive compression of the earths magnetosphere and triggering a severe geomagnetic storm 
the grapes muon telescope located at tata institute of fundamental researchs cosmic ray laboratory in ooty in tamil nadu recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays of about  gev last year lasting for two hours 
the burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona and moving with a speed of about  million kilometres per hour struck our planet causing a severe compression of earths magnetosphere from  to  times the radius of earth 
it triggered a severe geomagnetic storm that generated aurora borealis and radio signal blackouts in many high latitude countries according to the study published in the journal physical review letters this week 
earths magnetosphere extends over a radius of a million kilometres which acts as the first line of defence shielding us from the continuous flow of solar and galactic cosmic rays thus protecting life on our planet from these high intensity energetic radiations 
numerical simulations performed by the grapes researchers including pravata k mohanty indicate that the earths magnetic shield temporarily cracked due to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection allowing the lower energy galactic cosmic ray particles to enter our atmosphere 
earths magnetic field bent these particles about  degree from the dayside to the nightside of the earth where it was detected as a burst by the grapes muon telescope around midnight on  june  
the data was analysed and interpreted through extensive simulation over several weeks by using the core computing farm that was built inhouse by the grapes team of physicists and engineers at the cosmic ray laboratory in ooty

Mikael Thalen,exstate dept employee sending sensitive info to private email norm under clinton,"get ready for civil unrest survey finds that most americans are concerned about election violence time is rapidly slipping away and november th will be here before we know it michael snyder  economic collapse  october   comments 
could we see violence no matter who wins on november th lets hope that it doesnt happen but as you will see below antitrump violence is already sweeping the nation 
if trump were to actually win the election that would likely send the radical left into a violent postelection temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before alternatively there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by hillary clinton and as i showed yesterday it appears that voting machines in texas are already switching votes from donald trump to hillary clinton  if hillary clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country 
at this moment there is less than two weeks to go until november th and a brand new survey has found that a majority of americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day 
a  majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on election day one in five are very concerned three of four say they have confidence that the united states will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked american democracy for more than  years but just  say they are very confident about that 
more than four in  of trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of clinton as president if she prevails because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square 
but many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence on wednesday donald trumps star on the walk of fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pickax 
donald trump took a lot of hits today and not just in the presidential race with less than two weeks to go before america decides if the ex apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over hillary clinton trumps star on the hollywood walk of fame was destroyed early wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a tinseltown first 
and there were two other instances earlier this year when donald trumps star was also vandalized one came in january and the other happened in june  
this is of course not the first time the gop candidates star has been attacked or defaced since trump announced his white house bid in summer  the most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at  hollywood blvd in late january in june this summer a mute sign was painted on trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign in both cases trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day 
we have seen antitrump violence on the east coast as well earlier this month someone decided to firebomb the republican party headquarters in orange county north carolina on the building next to the headquarters someone spraypainted nazi republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika 
there have also been other disturbing incidents of antitrump violence all over the nation in recent days a recent lifezette article put together quite a long list and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece 
on oct  in bangor maine vandals spraypainted about  parked cars outside a trump rally trump supporter paul foster whose van was hit with white paint told reporters why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars all of this to make their statement 
around oct  a couple of trump supporters were assaulted in zeitgeist a san francisco bar after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for trump gotnews reports the two trump supporters were attacked punched and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back lilian kim of abc  bay area tweeted a photo of the men in which one was wearing a trump tshirt and the other was wearing a blue lives matter shirt 
on sept  in el cajon california an angry mob at a black lives matter protest beat yearold trump supporter feras jabro for wearing a make america great again baseball cap the assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app periscope 
there is a move to get trump supporters to wear red on election day but in many parts of america that might just turn his supporters into easy targets lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating 
of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad and a hillary clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge 
for example this week former congressman joe walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if donald trump loses the election 
former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald trump is not elected president 
walsh a former tea party congressman from illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host tweeted on november th im voting for trump on november th if trump loses im grabbing my musket you in 
and without a doubt many ordinary americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case hillary clinton is victorious the following comes from usa today  
since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards hillary clinton ive been buying a lot more ammunition says rick darling  an engineer from harrison township in michigans detroit suburbs in a followup phone interview after being surveyed the trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election 
today america is more divided than i have ever seen it before and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another 
ironically donald trump has been working very hard to bring america together in fact he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any republican presidential candidate since   
if hillary clinton and the democrats win on november th things will not go well for hillary clintons political enemies the clintons used the power of the white house to go after their enemies the first time around and hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then 
and the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are this is something that i discussed on national television earlier this month  
as i write this it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a hillary clinton presidency would be 
but at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome  
out of all the candidates that we could have chosen the american people are about to put the most evil one by far into the white house 
perhaps donald trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate but time is rapidly slipping away and november th will be here before we know it newsletter sign up",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,7.057613867992074,80,12,7173,1251,4.693045563549161,1251.0,0.5515977490921837,0.3616742515005802,1.1096671463469456,1.18321381694287,-0.3908886880401633,1.2224743109642286,0.0039968025579536,0.0,0.0015987210231814,0,2,0.0,0.0079980294316707,-0.9961,0.1,0.136,0.764,Negative,Very Strong
André du Pôle,more emotions men should master,"gentlemen donald j trump is the new presidentelect of the united states though a a few results may still be unclear trump has captured the perennial large battleground states of ohio florida iowa and north carolina plus georgia and in a change not seen in more than a generation he has seized pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin
pennsylvania and michigan have not voted for a republican presidential candidate since  and wisconsin since way back in  it appears also that states the democrats thought were well and truly in the bag for them such as minnesota maine and virginia have stayed blue with only waferthin or very disappointing margins the nd congressional district of maine a state which divides its electoral votes along with nebraska has been called for the republicans for the first time in nearly  years the last time any maine district voted for a gop presidential candidate was  when george h w bush seized all four electoral votes there
importantly too avowedly liberal states have seen significant turnouts for trump for example counts so far show that some  of voters in connecticut and rhode island states with even more liberal media bias than the nation generally have opted for the racist sexist and homophobic republican candidate their votes ultimately did not change the electoral college map but it is heartening to know that even in the eye of the liberal storm plenty of people are happy to support trump this is despite them facing fierce rebukes and often enough violence if they make their views public
the clown candidate has beaten  more experienced republican challengers and now hillary clinton the most elitebacked candidate in the worlds political history
as tonights results have shown plenty of trump voters in red and blue states alike have been forced to keep their beliefs quiet media airtime for protrump views and stories has been deliberately minimized and frequently demonized by the major networks mainstream journalists such as glenn thrush  wolf blitzer  jake tapper  jessica valenti  and brent budowsky have been caught collaborating with both the dnc and clinton campaign if you believe that these two groups are actually separate this only increases the esteem in which the emphatic resounding trump victory needs to be held
and lets not forget the senate and house races after months of spineless gop cucks rushing to differentiate themselves from trump the donald has still carried them to victory in both houses of congress  the white house senate and house of representatives are all in republican hands until at least the  house midterms can you taste the very salty tears of the liberals and sjws yet
every powerful vested interest not only supported hillary but did everything they could to ruin trump yes its happening
did you see the last major hillary clinton rallies celebritiescumpolitical hacktivists chief among them lady gaga beyoncé jay z bruce springsteen bon jovi and katy perry all fell into clintons corner well before their final appearances for her excoriating anyone who had the gall to support donald trump even longterm republicans who betrayed trump like arnold schwarzenegger were attacked by celebrity sjws such as robert deniro after they joined the never trump ranks as if they were dangerous saboteurs the celebrity paranoia has been palpable for months hollywood that broad industry taking in not just film stars but also singers silver screen actors and comedians has become little more than an overpaid trade union for hillary clinton
likewise every major american company that has come out for a candidate has come out for hillary plenty of neutral corporations have undoubtedly been funneling support to the clinton campaign behind the scenes as well prominent billionaires like george soros and warren buffett have done all they could to drag hillarys stumbling halfcorpse both literally and figuratively across the line whilst trump has been supported by a number of tenfigure businessmen these men are regularly attacked in the media they include the scapegoated but brave peter thiel and carl icahn
and then theres the mainstream media countless studies have indicated that about  of all journalists are liberal this overrepresentation is more salient still in the upper echelons of newsmen and women particularly prominent mastheads such as the new york times  washington post  and huffington post  plus democratic tv surrogates like cnn and nbc the  campaign has inflated this preexisting liberal bias one that plagued the two george w bush administrations but raged even more ferociously against donald trump over the last  months
all of these media elites have lambasted trump for over a year at the same time they give the paltriest coverage of the disgusting hillary podesta and dnc emails everything newsworthy on this front from the overwhelming presence of clinton foundation donors in hillarys secretary of state diary book to more recent revelations about john podestas involvement with satanic rituals has been brushed off the balcony by the wolf blitzers and chuck todds of the american mainstream media yet trump has triumphed nonetheless
the new administration must crush the criminal democratic elites and clinton foundation with the rule of law will hillary now find herself stumbling into jail
inasmuch as the clinton campaign the sjws and their big business and media enablers have been defeated in this years election they retain very welloiled and effective means for trying to undermine president trump once he takes office trumps first priority as commanderinchief must be to remove the bureaucratic apparatchiks preventing a full and frank investigation of the clinton foundation he also needs to clear the way for legal inquiries into the various criminal activities as uncovered by wikileaks perpetrated from within the dnc and hillary clintons campaign
the department of justice in particular has engaged in all manner of skulduggery most notably when attorneygeneral loretta lynch had a private meeting with bill clinton during the most crucial time of the fbi investigation into hillarys emails additionally elements of the state department illegally informed hillary about new developments in that same case enough is enough its time to drain the swamp
election night produced another curveball after weeks of calling donald trump a sore loser for him not saying if he would respect the final result hillary clinton refused to speak to her supporters and the american people it would seem that she only telephoned trump privately so whos the sore loser now
last night we were witnesses to the greatest electoral seachange in americanand perhaps globalhistory we cannot lose sight of the work to be done but for the next  hours we can bask in this unprecedented victory against all odds
hail to the chief donald j trump

Luke Stranahan,donald trump is the candidate for americans not special interests,"gentlemen i am filled to the brim with joy we have successfully thwarted the globalists plans to ruin americaweve fought against the big banks weve fought against the satanic pedophile elites  and weve fought against the corrupt mainstream media
but the battle is not over yet we still have much to do if we wish to make america great again this will not be an easy fight for we will certainly face much resistance along the way expect the cucks and liberals to throw temper tantrums as their safe spaces come tumbling down expect the mainstream media to demonize the altright and expect the elites to do everything they can to stop us
they will not stop us thoughno we are far too powerful the wheels of truth do in fact turn slowly but alas they turn and they are growing in speed as we blaze towards victory here are four goals that we must achieve on our path to victory
 dismantle the mainstream media 
as more and more of us start to wake up the media will begin to sense thisin fact they already have have you wondered why theyve started to cover antihillary stories its because they realize that theyre losing credibility
the mainstream media is very well aware that theyre losing their chokehold on the american publics mind so in a last ditch effort theyre trying to seem unbiased do not buy into their liesits all a giant farce an attempt to regain their former credibility
over the next four years it will be extremely important to start dismantling these outlets its time to call them out for what they are start sharing altright stories on facebook and twitter get our message out there dont watch any mainstream media
dont buy mainstream magazines dont watch their news shows hell dont even pay for cable do everything you can to bleed their pockets dry
as more and more money moves away from the mainstream media it will naturally move towards alternative news sourcessites like return of kings info wars matt forney  and danger and play will become the new media
dont expect this to happen at first however in one final cry before its gory death the media will proclaim that there is a new racist xenophobic enemy that helped donald get into office the altright
expect them to demonize us expect them to lie about us to scream and shout and to protest this is fine howeverfor we are antifragile the altright is in a very unique position
any and all hatred towards the altright will be a net win for us why its simple any publicity is good publicity a single mention of an alternative news site by the msm can and often does net us tens of thousands of new viewers
in other words if they ignore us we continue to grow in power if they attack us we grow even faster they cant win
 drain the swamp 
everything that weve done up to this point to get donald in office will be completely pointless if we dont drain the swamp this is our one chancewe have four years to do this
in order for us to bring about permanent change in this country we need to hold the cucks and libtards accountable for their actions anyone who pushed the proislam agenda rape culture or feminazi philosophy must be called out for the traitors that they are
the elites the corrupt bankers and the globalists must all be brought to light in order for us to bring about true change and to prevent a globalist dictatorship from happening in the near future we must ensure that at least  of americans are aware of the elites conspiracy by the next election
this is a grass roots movement and it is growing in powerbut we must take away power from those who tried so hard to fight us now is the time to cause a ruckus and email your representatives now is the time to demand hillary be thrown in prison
every single person involved in hillary clintons private email server must be thrown in jail pedophiles and satanists such as anthony weiner and marina abramovic and traitors such as huma abedin and comey must be thrown in jail for their crimes
now is the time to clear out the murky watersto sift through the dirt and rotten garbage lurking below i believe that once all is said and done america will enter into a new age of prosperity the patriarchy will return
 normalize straight males 
for too long have men been oppressed by the very civilization which we created we have let the sjws and culture warriors back us into a corner but weve finally started to fight back
more and more men upon being exposed to the manosphere are starting to wake up and take the red pill  were starting to realize as a nation that there is no reason to be ashamed of being white or being a man
once we start to dismantle the mainstream media and drain the swamp most of this should happen naturallyit was only through the artificial social engineering that being a white male became a crime
but we cant stop hereits time to start slowly redpilling our bluepilled friends the best way to do this is simply through osmosis dont try to convince them with logic because they did not arrive at a bluepilled position through logic they did so through emotion
simply be a beacon of masculinity be confident in yourself be assertive and dont cave into ridiculous hr requests or political correctness social pressures again once the mainstream media is dismantled and the manosphere grows in popularity our movement will gain strength exponentially
the normalization of males especially white males is essential for our culture to continuethe second that we started to become ashamed of our heritage and of our nationality was the second that the cucks started closing in we cannot give them an inch or they will take a mile
this is not to say that our country shouldnt accept immigrantsif they go through the legal process how did it get so far that it became socially unacceptable to shame illegal immigrants again illegal immigrants like i said it got this way due to an overwhelming amount of white guilt do not be ashamed of your heritage men
we have made a gigantic step towards national sovereignty with donald trump being elected as president and we cannot let this victory go in vain we must push onward and continue to normalize what is normal being a straight male white or note should be the norm not being a transgender greenhaired sjw
 get the law on our side 
as our grass roots movement picks up more and more steam i believe that the pressure we create will naturally push judges and lawmakers to change our corrupt legal system
first things first we must create laws that treat men and women as they should be treated too many laws are skewed in favor of women now that women have the right to work we must remove alimonyits ridiculous that men should have to pay  a month to their exwives because she got used to a certain living situation
we must remove corrupt antimale divorce laws ridiculous hatespeech laws which infringe on our freedom of speech and ultimately sjw rape laws
i along with many other rok men have been falsely accused of rape  its time to remove all of these ridiculous laws that make it illegal for men to simply talk to women and that were built into the system by the elites in order to wage war against men
the law should encourage freedom of speech the fact that twitter has not been held accountable for banning milo yiannopoulos is absolutely absurd information and social media platforms should be held to the same standards that the american people are
google needs to stop censoring search resultsand if they dont its time for us to create laws against this type of behavior allowing google to filter search results is like a regression back to medieval times for one entity to selectively edit our version of reality is unacceptable
most importantly judges and lawmakers that have taken bribes should be thrown in jailindefinitely anyone who took a donation from george soros or any other member of the bilderberg group should be imprisoned for crimes of treason
summary 
we are on the path towards victory menbut it will not be without many hiccups the first thing that the mainstream media will do is demonize the altright but again this will only make us stronger it will expose our view points to a larger audience
expect it to get darker just before the dawn expect feminists sjws cucks and libtards to protest and scream and shoutbut it will all be in vain too many men are starting to wake up too many men are starting to see the lies that have been shoved down our throats  and there is no going back
the next four years will be more important than ever our primary objective is to dismantle the mainstream media through natural means its time for them to be exposed as the liars that they are simply eliminating the msm will be most of the battleremember this is a war of information and when the altright starts to control the news there will be sanity
we must also focus on draining the swamp we must rid our corrupt political establishment of the people whove betrayed us we must normalize the family unit and white menno longer shall we feel ashamed of our gender or sexual orientation
then from here the laws must change remember this will not be easy there will be much resistance along the way but weve come this far weve beat all odds and elected trump as the president of our nationand its time to make america great again

Paul,captions,"fox news 
the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clintons use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election 
fbi director james comey wrote in a letter to top members of congress friday that the bureau has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation 
click here to read the letter 
comey did not detail those emails saying only that they surfaced in connection with an unrelated case 
he told lawmakers the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation 
he said the fbi could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete this additional work 
a senior law enforcement official separately told fox news the fbi decision is not linked to wikileaks messages or any hack and the newly discovered emails did not come from the clinton server  but from another device from another government official 
the move comes after comey and the justice department decided in july not to pursue charges over clintons email practices saying at the time that the investigation was finished 
comey has since come under criticism from donald trump lawmakers and others who claim the investigation downplayed the mishandling of classified information during clintons tenure 
trump speaking to cheering supporters friday afternoon in manchester nh praised the fbi for having the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made  saying he hopes that is corrected 
hillary clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before trump said we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office 
in a nod to the significance of the fbis announcement trump quipped the rest of my speech is going to be so boring 
other gop lawmakers also weighed in urging the bureau to pursue a thorough new probe 
the fbis decision to reopen its investigation into secretary clinton reinforces what the house judiciary committee has been saying for months the more we learn about secretary clintons use of a private email server the clearer it becomes that she and her associates committed wrongdoing and jeopardized national security house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte rva said in a statement 
republican national committee chairman reince priebus said the discovery must be serious for the bureau to investigate this close to the election 
clinton did not respond to questions from reporters about the development as she landed in cedar rapids iowa and did not address the matter while speaking to supporters in the same city 
the development comes  days before the general election and is the latest shockwave to hit the race clinton had been gaining in the polls over trump in the wake of the release of footage showing trump talking about groping women and subsequent allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him 
however daily revelations from hacked clinton campaign emails obtained by wikileaks have become a headache for the democrats campaign the resumption of the fbi probe poses a potentially bigger problem 
ron hosko former assistant director of the fbi told fox news in a telephone interview that retired fbi officials were livid at comey over the fact that charges were not brought against clinton in round one of the investigation 
he lit her on fire and then walked away hosko said of comey holding a news conference laying out clintons mishandling of classified information but then not pressing criminal charges 
hosko said he still defends comey for not pressing charges because the fbi always has to make a decision based on what they have at the time hosko said he thinks agents were probing a separate matter and found emails that made them say oh my god look at what we have 
house speaker paul ryan called the fbi decision long overdue breaking news  the fbi is reopening its investigation into secretary hillary clinton

Jason Easley,trump campaign admits they are trying to steal the election with voter suppression,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat oct th  at  pm that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released   
coming from people who believe in something called spiritual warfare a nebulous spiritual struggle taking place over and above all the talk about issues and policy positions  it is perhaps no surprise that the religious right should declare that their messiah  donald trump  is being threatened with witchcraft 
lance wallnau whose twitter page claims to be your spiritual warfare guide to the  election appeared on the jim bakker show to push the crazy idea that many christians feel this fog on their head at times and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released 
watch courtesy of right wing watch 
oh sweet baby jesus the mighty lance has struck out what has happened of course is that the religious right not only endorsed but anointed a candidate who embodies the exact opposite of the values they claim to champion its no wonder they feel in a fog  metaphorically or physically theyre selling their souls 
wallnau claims the left is a smaller number of radicals better organized than the larger body of christ who doesnt work together and thats the dilemma that americas in right now even though the left is a disparate alliance of various groups working together and the religious right has been organizing since goldwater lost in   
a hypocrite just cant catch a break it seems 
the web literally is coming down on america and whats sad is how many christians feel this fog on their head at times do you feel that its almost like everythings going wrong we dont realize its a remnant operating strategically through organizations that are intent on shifting the american culture and discipling the country and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released 
wherever theres agreement theres power the more unbelievers agree with the narrative that theyre hearing the more power and authorization satan has to manifest so unless the church has an exposure of what the enemys doing and begins to agree together with a counterstrategy were going to deal with more and more fog and the worst part iswe dont have to surrender nations to the devil 
so if you disagree with wallnau if you oppose trump it can only because youre manifesting the power of satan who in the old testament is gods lieutenant not his adversary so pick your testament i suppose 
lance wallnau insists he is not a big conspiracy theorist buff but this doesnt do anything to convince us hes not some wackadoodle instead this is nothing new as a nonchristian being told that you represent a devil you dont even believe exists 
there are  years of history backing up the accusation and testifying to its usefulness for religious zealots hoping to delegitimize or worse their opponents 
without charges of satanism and witchcraft you dont have the genocide of european and middle eastern paganism you dont have antijewish pogroms and you dont have the crusades or the spanish inquisition you dont have witchburnings 
what this sort of nonsense illustrates for liberals and progressives is that were not fighting on the same battleground as our opponents 
not only do they deal in a conspiracyladen world a world free of facts but a world in which what might be hiding under your bed or in your closet has real power and reason  and lets go ahead and say sanity  do not

admin,get ready for civil unrest survey finds that most americans are concerned about election violence,"record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban 
steve   
a new poll released by gallup has found that a record amount of americans are opposed to gun control measures  
the survey found that  percent of respondents over three quarters believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law 
the findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades 
the poll also found that almost two thirds  percent are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them 
that figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue  years ago 
just  percent less than a third say they support a ban on handgun ownership while only  percent support a semiautomatic ban an eightpoint decline on previous findings 
in addition gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end 
in a summary of the new poll gallup seemed surprised by the findings describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox 
perhaps paradoxically opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles these guns were used in highprofile incidents including the terrorist attacks in san bernardino california and orlando and the mass shootings in aurora colorado and newtown connecticut 
the findings reveal just how out of step hillary clintons position on gun control is with the majority of americans 
hillary is a staunch gun control proponent wikileaks releases have revealed that hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order

republican theodore roosevelt was the first president to invite an africanamerican booker t washington to dine in the white house on oct   a southern democrat newspapers condemned him it as printed in the memphis scimitar the most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen of the united states was committed yesterday by the president when he invited a n to dine with him at the white house it would not be worth more than a passing notice if theodore roosevelt had sat down to dinner in his own home with a pullman car porter but roosevelt the individual and roosevelt the president are not to be viewed in the same light 
in  theodore roosevelt warned the thought of modern industry in the hands of christian charity is a dream worth dreaming the thought of industry in the hands of paganism is a nightmare beyond imagining the choice between the two is upon us 
in  the new york bible society had theodore roosevelt write a message which was inscribed in a pocket new testament  book of psalms given to world war i soldiers the teachings of the new testament are foreshadowed in micahs verse micah vi  what more does the lord require of thee than to do justice and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god do justice and therefore fight valiantly against the armies of germany and turkey for these nations in this crisis stand for the reign of moloch and beelzebub on this earth love mercy treat prisoners well succor the wounded treat every woman as if she was your sister care for the little children and be tender to the old and helpless walk humbly you will do so if you study the life and teachings of the saviour may the god of justice and mercy have you in his keeping  signed theodore roosevelt

armenians  for some centuries have sedulously avoided militarism and war  are so suffering precisely and exactly because they have been pacifists whereas their neighbors the turks have not been pacifists but militarists t roosevelt fear god p   
armenians have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the napoleonic warsthe wars of genghis khan and tamerlane in asia yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged  this course of national infamy  began when the last administration surrendered to the peace atanyprice people and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties individuals and nations who preach the doctrine of milkandwater invariably have in them a softness of fiber which means that they fear to antagonize those who preach and practice the doctrine of bloodandiron t roosevelt fear god p  
american eyewitness of the fearful atrocities mr arthur h gleason new york tribune nov   serbia is at this moment passing under the harrow of torture and mortal anguish now the armenians have been butchered under circumstances of murder and torture and rape that would have appealed to an oldtime apache indian  
even to nerves dulled and jaded by the heapedup horrors of the past year and a half the news of the terrible fate that has befallen the armenians must give a fresh shock of sympathy and indignation let me emphatically point out that the sympathy is useless unless it is accompanied with indignation and that the indignation is useless if it exhausts itself in words instead of taking shape in deeds  if this people through its government had not shirked its duty  we would now be able to take effective action on behalf of armenia 
mass meetings on behalf of the armenians amount to nothing whatever if they are mere methods of giving a sentimental but ineffective and safe outlet to the emotion of those engaged in them  the principles of the peaceatanyprice men of the professional pacifists  will be as absolutely ineffective for international righteousness  this crowning iniquity of the wholesale slaughter of the armenians  must be shared by the neutral powers headed by the united states for their failure to protest when this initial wrong was committed  the devastation of poland and serbia has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the seventeenthcentury europe  
weak and timid milkandwater policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the bloodandiron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world the crowning outrage has been committed by the turks on the armenians they have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of attila and of genghis khan 
it is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks neutral not only in deed but in thought between right and the most hideous wrong neutral between despairing and hunted people people whose little children are murdered and their women raped and the victorious and evil wrongdoers  
i trust that all americans worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful armenian atrocities i trust that they feel  that a peace obtained without  righting the wrongs of the armenians would be worse than any war  
wrongdoing will only be stopped by men who are brave as well as just who put honor above safety who are true to a lofty ideal of duty who prepare in advance to make their strength effective and who shrink from no hazard not even the final hazard of war if necessary in order to serve the great cause of righteousness when our people take this stand we shall also be able effectively to take a stand in international matters which shall prevent such cataclysms of wrong as have been witnesseson an even greater scale in armenia t roosevelt fear god pp  
in his book fear god and take your part  theodore roosevelt wrote 
christianity is not the creed of asia and africa at this moment solely because the seventh century christians of asia and africa had trained themselves not to fight whereas the moslems were trained to fight christianity was saved in europe solely because the peoples of europe fought 
if the peoples of europe in the th and th centuries and on up to and including the th century had not possessed a military equality with and gradually a growing superiority over the mohammedans who invaded europe europe would at this moment be mohammedan and the christian religion would be exterminated 
a contemporary of theodore roosevelt was the english author gk chesterton who wrote of western christian civilization the collected works of gk chesterton volume xx introduction and notes by james v schall ignatius press they seem entirely to forget that long before the crusaders had dreamed of riding to jerusalem the moslems had almost ridden into paris 
theodore roosevelt continued in fear god and take your part  wherever the mohammedans have had complete sway wherever the christians have been unable to resist them by the sword christianity has ultimately disappeared from the hammer of charles martel to the sword of jan sobieski christianity owed its safety in europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and would fight as well as the mohammedan aggressor

Brendan,solar winds spur geomagnetic storm that may affect power," reasons why youre not happy  reasons why youre not happy 
corey is an aspiring iconoclast he believes that the key to life is for men to honour their primal nature

happiness its what we all want as human beings no matter the differences in where we seek them we are motivated to do things to be happy and we avoid things that may detract from it even those who claim that they dont care about happiness or that theyre living for a higher purpose is doing what they do because it makes them happy in that way happiness is beyond a state of feeling it is a state of being 
now although you dont want to be obsessive about happiness and make your life revolve around attaining it there are few things you can do to live a more fulfilling life and improve the quality of your being and as its often the case with selfimprovement i believe that addressing the bad habits will lead to a healthier life than trying to gain the positives 
here are some ways you may be sabotaging your own happiness  you are chasing it ill be happy once i finally 
the more you chase happiness the less you have of it and not only are people today chasing happiness theyre chasing all the wrong things in hopes that it will bring them everlasting joy money women and status may elevate your life but they cant be the source of happiness alone they will especially fail as being compensation for some void in your life that youre trying to fill 
also know that your mood will naturally fluctuate over time constantly obsessing over how you feel and getting stressed over your emotional state will not help you so rather than jumping from one thing to another in hopes that it will boost your mood or dull your pain focus on things that matter to you its far better to work on selfimprovement and enhancing the overall quality of your life than be wavered by feelings  you dont have the basics taken care of good sleep is extremely underrated in our busy society it affects your mood testosterone level mental capacity and more prioritize sleep as much as you do with healthy diet and working out 
its often the basics that are overlooked ask yourself are you sleeping well its harder to tell than you think are you eating healthy are you keeping yourself fit are you getting enough sunlight do you ever take the time to connect with nature do you have a stable life do you have a purpose or a meaning i doubt most people have all of these basic needs checked off but im willing to bet that an improvement in even one area will significantly improve a persons mood and well being  you concern yourself with things you cant control no something bad is happening in the world and i cant do jack shit about it time to complain about it on the internet 
the more you sweat over issues which you can take no practical action over the more helpless you feel and the more unhappy you will be of course being able to tell the difference between what you can control and what you cant is an art in itself that you need to master through experience one thing im personally doing to lower stress is to reduce my news consumption and be less concerned with events around the world that are irrelevant to my personal life ill read enough to get a general awareness of whats happening around the world but i refuse to be emotionally invested in things i have no control over  you lack intimacy and deep human connection if you dont have any friends to be vulnerable with you didnt have any to begin with 
i would argue that this is one of the biggest if not the biggest factor in causing anxiety depression and general unhappiness in the modern world humans are social creatures and we need to bond with others and beyond simply spending time with people to chat and drink deeper connection needs to be made with people the quality matters much more than the quantity 
in todays societyespecially in north americait seems people have all become superficial and afraid of intimacy whether it be for friendship or romance without opening up your true self due to the fear of being rejected or ridiculed all the relationships you have with others will not be genuine and it will not be fulfilling  you are not living in the present reality you may be conscious but are you aware 
if you live in the past or the future you lose touch with the present reality that disconnection will cause longing which can only lead to dissatisfaction and loss of joy 
the lure of nostalgia and daydreaming of a better life or an improved world is actually quite insidious because of how intoxicating it is when your mind drifts to imagining a pleasurable experience or a more exciting life you are tricked into thinking that the longing is happiness itself sort of like how mirages work on the contrary studies have actually shown that you are actually happier and more productive when you focus on what youre doing right now even if the task is boring so stick to the reality and forget about your fantasies either make things happen or accept that youre just wasting your time and energy on wishful thinking  you engage in junk activities im happy im happy im happy 
just as there are junk foods there are junk activities that may feel pleasurable at the time but dissatisfying and even harmful in the longrun 
ask yourself do you really need entertainment ive squandered my youth by immersing myself in long hours of digital entertainment day after day i barely even noticed that i was unhappy the whole time because i was so sedated and what did i even get out of them those were several hours everyday that i could have spent reading working out learning new skills meeting new people and experiencing the world 
the fact is giving up on entertainment has no negative impact on your level of happiness sure you might miss them when theyre suddenly gone but overall as long as you find more valuable things to do your life can only get better when you ditch them learn to enjoy things that give you value rather than seeking enjoyment in things without value conclusion 
unlike what many people today say no one deserves happiness thats something youll have to earn ill go as far as to say that happinessas defined by modern standardsisnt even necessary and hard to come by for certain individuals everyone has their own path towards living life to his unique potential and there is no universal rule that applies to all so while i havent really listed anything specific for the reader to strive towards i hope i laid out some pitfalls that you can avoid in your journey nov   corey savage",projectveritas.com,Fake,english,3.003809664473759,2.2264292892673696,56,9,6635,1197,4.518796992481203,1197.0,-0.1822031951418003,-0.2020278943791856,0.9673275881460938,1.098559054279425,-0.562854939013283,1.1358403531574683,0.0008354218880534,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0012615509194599,0.9301,0.145,0.139,0.717,Positive,Very Strong
"Mike Adams, NaturalNews Editor",clinton crime family must be taken down arrest them all clinton podesta abedin lynch mook stephanopoulos and all the coconspirators,"hillary clinton is keeping her foot on the gas pedal by hammering donald trump for taking the day off to promote his hotel built with undocumented workers instead of campaigning 
video 
clinton said 
hillary clinton could probably spend  hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting trumps hypocrisies 
while trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new dc hotel hillary clinton was winning more early votes in the state of florida there are two competing messages in the media currently about the election the first message is that democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting the second message is that a few state polls have shown trump leading by a little in florida and gaining ground in new hampshire 
it is possible that both of these stories are correct democrats are blowing out republicans in early voting and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news some republicans may be coming back to trump 
the important thing for hillary clinton and democrats is not to let up democrats are very close to generation defining win but victory is not sealed yet more polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend but the polls may not matter 
if most of the ballots in states like north carolina and florida are cast before election day the polls may end up meaning very little

Alex Ansary,wikileaks assange promises hillarys arrest with next release,"carter reveals upgrades to us long range rocket  
sputnik news 
on tuesday us defense secretary ashton carter announced that the armys tactical missile system atacms will be upgraded to strike both land and sea targets such technology will go a long way to defending allies against the chinese menace and battling moscows aggression in the baltics 
the missile system is sponsored by an office created by carter in  the strategic capabilities office which is currently being lead by will roper a protege of the secretarys during a panel at the center for strategic and international studies csis on friday roper told an audience how you offset the adversaries trying to offset your offset its very simple to do that you just dont talk about your best capabilitieswe are keeping our best ideas behind the door and probably always will according to breaking defense 
after the panel he continued we thought it was important to come out in public with atacms for the army because theres been a lot of writing a lot of speeches on the need for the army to go crossdomain high ranking officials in the us military have been calling for the atacms to extend its capabilities seaward for some time and roper responded to these concerns saying its time for us to show it isnt just a theoretical idea its something we can potentially get to quickly with something that we already have 
during a morning session at csis carter spoke of the new innovative features of the atacms and how the sco tries to maximize the potential of existing systems 
a prominent theme of scos work is spearheading creative and unexpected new ways to use our existing missiles and advanced munitions and across varied domains he said adding  by integrating an existing seeker onto the front of the missile theyre enabling it to hit moving targets both at sea as well as on land with this capability what was previously an army surfacetosurface missile system can project power from coastal locations up to  kilometers into the maritime domain 
carter detailed the scos plans to utilize seeker technology that the defense department has already developed so the missile system can hit targets both on sea and land

Raymond Ibrahim,the psychopathic and insincere jihad,"a look at the universitys new mission october   jack kerwick 
jonathan haidt a professor of social psychology at new york university argued in a recently published essay that while its traditional telos end or goal has been truth within the last few decades the university has assumed another social justice 
the university however can only have one telos 
the conflict between these two goals has raged for decades haidt claims last year though it became unmanageable when student groups at  universities and colleges around the country issued  demands  to administrators demands for social justice that by and large were met 
the following statement is posted at blackliberationcollectiveorg  
we demand at the minimum black students and black faculty to be reflected by the national percentage of black folk in the state and the country 
we demand free intuition for black and indigenous students 
we demand a divestment from prisons and an investment in communities 
a statement of principles follows the black liberation collective blc opposes antiblackness sexism ableism capitalism white privilege inequality and heteronormativity it rejects as well nonviolence considered as a principle in contradistinction to a tactic  
antiblack racism is woven in the fabric of our global society says the blc when social systems are racialized by white supremacy whiteness becomes the default of humanity and blackness is stripped of its humanity becoming a commodity becoming disposable 
the blc is antisexist insofar as it affirms the value of all black womens lives whether cisgender transgender or genderqueer in addition to rejecting eurocentric beauty standards that are made to lessen the beauty of black women and black womens features being antisexist also means realizing that police brutality the prison industrial system school to prison pipeline and the like are aspects of structural racism that affect black women as much as they impact black men 
black liberation entails queer liberation and trans liberation we also seek to destroy the heteronormative norms that dehumanize black queer people the blc asserts the homophobia within the black community comes by way of the same hands responsible for white supremacy 
presumably transphobia within the black community is also a legacy of white supremacy in cooperation with cissexism and the gender binary transphobia has been used as a means of invalidating and erasing our trans family members the blc pledges to eliminate such systemic biases 
these social justice warriors sjws are staunch opponents of the capitalist notions of infinite profit homogenized markets and a privatized means of production capitalism they insist is the economic system thats been used to justify the oppression marginalization and exploitation of blacks 
nor is the solution to this oppression to be found in supporting blackowned businesses the blc explains that we cannot adopt the patriarchal exploitative tools of our oppressors as we seek liberation rather the solution is to dismantle antiblack capitalist corporations that benefit from our oppression 
it isnt only the capitalist corporations that these students want destroyed they demand as well the eradication of all institutional practices and policies that discriminate against the black community and the removal of all federal state and local government officials who do not abide by our principles 
the state and all its institutions that deny black humanity and black agency must be dismantled and replaced with those that produce black liberty 
concerning its attitude toward america the blc is clear this country was built to systematically oppress groups of people and the black liberation collective will not stand for it 
haidt misspeaks in characterizing  as the year when the university experienced a crisis of identity an unmanageable conflict of goals to judge from the vast majority of liberal arts humanities and social sciences departments social justice long ago eclipsed truth as the raison detre of the academy interestingly it is these sjw demands from last year that bear this out 
perhaps it is because ive spent the last couple of decades in the academy in the capacity of both student and faculty that i may be more privy to this than are some others but its painfully obvious that these student activists did not come up with these demands on their own if they didnt have their professors actually write the demands for them then the black liberation collective unquestionably derived the concepts and language of their statement of demands from their mentors 
to put it bluntly one must attend college major in the liberal arts and humanities and study under far left professors in order to think in the terms that are characteristic of social justice warriors 
leftist ideologues are training their students to bend the university to their will this is the first point there is though another a rich irony that is lost upon these selfstyled radicals 
for all of their bluster over systemic racism and structural white supremacy ie phenomena that are omnipresent and hence largely unconscious these black students their white collaborators and their professors fail to realize that their thinking for lack of a better term on these issues is about as eurocentric as one can get the  critical race theory  to which the blc subscribe is a version of marxism the philosophical vision of a  th century germanjewish man the marxist tradition within which they are enmeshed was fleshed out over a span of generations by mostly white heterosexual men 
but theres more to it than this 
the idea that racism sexism homophobia transphobia ableism and the like against which sjws rail are evils to be defeated is itself peculiar to the moral traditions of european civilization if these isms and phobias are immoral it can only be because those who are guilty of them fail to judge the individual as an individual color gender sexual orientation ability and so forth are neither constitutive of nor essential to the moral identity of the individualbut only if the framework of the doctrine of individualism is accepted 
yet this conception of the sacrosanct individual is as eurocentric as the proverbial apple pie is american 
the social justice warriors intellectual landscape is as much a european colony as was any west african country in the  th or early  th centuries those in the black liberation collective have most definitely internalized the modes of thought of their oppressor

Theodore Shoebat,french political leader france is about to enter a holy war with islam  embrace christianity never accept the religion of satan,"posted by michael snyder 
in the world of politics the coverup is often worse than the original crime it was his role in the watergate coverup that took down richard nixon and now hillary clintons coverup of her email scandal could send her to prison for a very very long time when news broke that the fbi has renewed its investigation into hillary clintons emails  it sent shockwaves throughout the political world  but this time around we arent just talking about an investigation into the mishandling of classified documents i havent heard anyone talking about this but if the fbi discovers that hillary clinton altered destroyed or concealed any emails that should have been turned over to the fbi during the original investigation she could be charged with obstruction of justice that would immediately end her political career and if she was found guilty it could send her to prison for the rest of her life 
i have not seen a single news report mention the phrase obstruction of justice yet but i am convinced that there is a very good chance that this is where this scandal is heading the following is the relevant part of the federal statute that deals with obstruction of justice  
whoever knowingly alters destroys mutilates conceals covers up falsified or makes a false entry in any record document or tangible object with the intent to impede obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or any case filed under title  or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case shall be fined under this title imprisoned not more than  years or both 
if hillary clinton is sent to prison for  years that would essentially be for the rest of her life 
i have a feeling that the fbi is going to find a great deal of evidence of obstruction of justice in huma abedins emails but unfortunately there is not likely to be a resolution to this matter before november th because according to the wall street journal there are approximately  emails to search through 
as federal agents prepare to scour roughly  emails to see how many relate to a prior probe of hillary clinton s email use the surprise disclosure that investigators were pursuing the potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside the bureau and the justice department over how to investigate the democratic presidential nominee 
metadata found on the laptop used by former rep anthony weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin a close clinton aide suggests there may be thousands of emails sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter it will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are workrelated from the time ms abedin served with mrs clinton at the state department how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the federal bureau of investigation and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the clinton email probe 
of those  emails an inside source told fox news that  at least   would be of interest to the investigation 
at this point fbi officials have not even begun searching through the emails because a search warrant has not been secured yet the following comes from cnn  
government lawyers havent yet approached abedins lawyers to seek an agreement to conduct the search sources earlier told cnn that those discussions had begun but the law enforcement officials now say they have not 
either way government lawyers plan to seek a search warrant from a judge to conduct the search of the computer the law enforcement officials said 
but the fbi is reportedly already searching a laptop that was coowned by anthony weiner and huma abedin and no warrant was necessary for that search because weiner is cooperating with the fbi 
many have been wondering why fbi director james comey would choose to make such a bold move just over a week until election day surely he had to know that this would have a dramatic impact on the election and it is unlikely that he would have done so unless someone had already found something really big in addition comey was reportedly eager to find an opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his peers at the fbi the following is an excerpt from a daily mail article that was written by ed klein the author of a recently released new york times bestseller about the clintons entitled  guilty as sin  
the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week 
some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 
according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice 
he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom 
so what happens next 
in the most likely scenario the fbi will not have time to complete the investigation and decide whether or not to charge hillary clinton before the election this means that we would go into november th with this scandal hanging over the clinton campaign and that would seem to be very good news for donald trump 
however it is possible that once the fbi starts searching through these emails that they could come to the conclusion very rapidly that charges against clinton are warranted and if that happens we could still see some sort of announcement before election day 
in the unlikely event that does happen we could actually see hillary clinton forced out of the race before november th 
once again this appears to be very unlikely at this point but it is still possible 
if clinton was forced to step aside the democrats would need to come up with a new nominee and that process would take time in an article later today on the most important news i will reveal who i believe that nominee would be 
in such a scenario the democrats would desperately need time to get their act together and so we could actually see barack obama attempt to delay or suspend the election  the legality of such a move is highly questionable but barack obama has not allowed a little thing like the us constitution to stop him in the past 
this week is going to be exceedingly interesting  that is for sure 
the craziest election in modern american history just keeps getting crazier and i have a feeling that even more twists and turns are ahead 
it sure seems ironic that anthony weiner is playing such a central role this late in the story and i cant wait to see what is in store for the season finale

my dad and bill clintons step dad were like brothers they often visited us on the holidays when i was a kid bill even knew the cows names by heart that always surprised me recalls the yearold thirdgeneration dairy farmer 
 my father was a strong democratic party supporter all his life and a big bill clinton fan so i never found the strength to tell him the truth before he passed away  
sex drugs and cattle 
during the  iowa caucus the clinton campaign stopped by for a night of festivities at the bradys farm a night tom brady says he will never forget 
the clinton team came by and we drank a lot and all was merry before they started indulging in hard drugs thats when everything went wrong he recalls visibly distraught by the whole affair 
i dont know about all those stories about him sexually assaulting women but i sure as hell know he assaulted one of our cows because i was there and i saw him do it with my own eyes and believe me its not something id wish my worst enemy to live to see he told local reporters 
im sorry for the clinton family but as a godfearing christian i just had to let the truth be known he adds

Sasha Brown,why marijuana should be legalized across the globe,"keywords complimentary medicine  holistic health  homeopathy  nhs 
the department for health is currently reviewing whether or not homeopathy in the nhs should continue to be available through doctor referrals against a backdrop of funding cuts and increasing pressure to reduce costs the government and health managers are looking at whether to add homeopathy to the nhss schedule  blacklist a selection of products that nhs doctors are banned from prescribing 
however despite consistent claims that there is a lack of quality evidence into the positive health benefits of homeopathy the nhs has spent more than m on homeopathic treatments over the last  years and any proposed ban is likely to have its fair share of detractors 
almost six million brits seek the help complementary and alternative medicine of which homeopathy is a part with one in four wanting access to be universally available through the nhs 
the lead argument for the exclusion of homeopathic treatment is lack of evidence that supports its effectiveness with research often being labeled as inconclusive however proponents for the inclusion of homeopathy argue that this doesnt necessarily mean that there is no evidence 
dr helen beaumont a gp and the president of the faculty of homeopathy has recently stated that homeopathic treatment has a profound effect on patients 
its disappointing that at a time when the nhs is facing a funding crisis the department of health is embarking on a costly consultation that could prevent highly skilled clinicians prescribing a course of treatment that benefits thousands of patients each year if the department were serious about saving money surely it should be looking at ssris selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors prescribed for mild to moderate depression in vast quantities at considerable cost to the nhs but which studies have found to be ineffective for those conditions 
george freeman the minister for life sciences has stated that in a time of rising demand the government has a duty to ensure nhs funds are spent only on the most effective treatments however an article in the british medical journal bmj that examined the scientific evidence behind nhs treatments found that  of  commonly used nhs treatments are of unknown effectiveness and only  are known to be beneficial the argument is being made that the principals being applied to homeopathy are consistent for all forms of treatments throughout the nhs 
collating research itself has also proved to be difficult with the positive effects of homeopathy often a challenge to fully quantify the nhs is driven by targets and trial evidence using hard data like death and disease to determine the effectiveness of a particular treatment researching and recording a patients quality of life happiness and emotional satisfaction has always been much more difficult to quantify but a wealth of anecdotal evidence and studies from other european countries continue to support the use of homeopathic treatment 
for example in  over a hundred homeopathic gp practices in germany and switzerland took up the challenge  of demonstrating the health of chronically ill patients after eight years of homeopathic treatment it concluded that homeopathy is clinically effective costeffective and safe  with the results playing an important role in the inclusion of homeopathy as part of their national healthcare scheme 
similarly the largest study at bristol homeopathic hospital  followed the effectiveness of homeopathy on  consecutive patients over a sixyear period  of followup patients reported improved health with  reporting major improvement 
the debate whether homeopathy in the nhs will no doubt continue the homeopathic profession has had to face increasing criticism and hostility over recent years but with an average annual spend of  on homeopathic treatment the equivalent of  of the total nhs drug budget it should be remembered that if these patients were not treated with homeopathic medicines they would have to be treated by other nhs departments with potentially more expensive conventional drugs   bmc public health bmc series    doi

Robert Spencer,selective outrage over splcs antimuslim extremist list," reminders to ignore the trump is doomed polls   
weve recently had two object lessons in the worthlessness of the trump is doomed polling saga a few days ago the media was loudly trumpeting that hillarys victory was inevitable that the polls were in and she was going to ignore trump and focus on building her administration and winning downticket races and then just like last time around the numbers turned around again 
i was recently asked to predict the race i answered that the one thing i could predict is that the media will claim a landslide for hillary right before the election that much is very likely 
its in the medias interest to spread fud by promoting polls that predict not just a hillary win but a landslide creating the perception that voting is useless the more republicans feel that the outcome is futile the less likely they will be to go out and vote but the scandal polling numbers have a history of rebounding this remains a challenging and very unusual election

Pamela Geller,wikileaks bill clinton boasts of hillarys working relationship with muslim brotherhood,"former united states attorney for the district of columbia joe digenova suggested friday james comeys reopening of the investigation into hillary clintons emails was the product of a revolt inside the fbi 
while speaking with wmals larry oconnor  digenova was asked what comey meant by saying newly discovered clinton emails from anthony weiner and huma abedins devices appear to be pertinent to the fbis prior investigation 
it tells me that the original investigation was not thorough and that it was an incompetent investigation digenova said otherwise they would have discovered this  and ill tell you why 
these were found on the phone that was used by anthony weiner and huma abedin he said why was that phone not looked at originally 
there could be one explanation huma abedin may have denied that any other phone existed and if she did she committed a felony she lied to the fbi just like general cartwright and if she did shes dead meat and comey knows it and theres nothing he can do about it 
digenova continued and why this letter was sent today was very simple the agents came to comey yesterday they told him about the evidence and he said oh s and realized that his goose was cooked that this would prove conclusively that his original investigation was incompetent and he knew that the agents running the weiner case would leak it if he did not send this letter to congress 
and ive also been told something very significant its been reported that those laptops belonging to clinton aides cheryl mills and heather samuelson were destroyed they were not and the reason is the fbi agents refused to do it 
digenova went on to say he believes there is a quiet but serious revolt against the director right now 
he sent those letters today because he is in deep trouble inside the bureau he said comey sent this letter today because he had to he has no moral authority inside the agency right now hes a joke hes a laughingstock of the agency and among former fbi agents he has become an anathema

having the two most hated politicians running for president of the us representing the two largest political parties has made a mockery of our democracy and electoral process hoenig told press tv on friday

for the third parties we have gary johnson of the libertarian party who has been made a laughing stock for his ignorance of foreign policy his poll numbers are dropping the other rd party candidate is jill stein of the green party who is seeing an actual rise in her numbers in spite of lies and smears coming from mostly the democrats with assistance from the main stream media he said 
that the race is tightening is no surprise it often happens at this time but the reasons now are not because people are becoming more assured of who they want but more and more disgusted in the choices they have he stated 
regardless of who wins and its most probable that itll be either clinton or trump this countrys nightmare will only begin on jan st the day after the inauguration if its clinton one wouldnt be surprised if the ink on the articles of impeachment isnt already dried by then its possible that criminal charges will have been presented to her or that she had received by then a presidential pardon from the outgoing president obama the analyst noted 
president ford once said when he was a leader in the house of representatives that impeachment is for whatever the congress wants it to be simply the whiff of impropriety or criminal behavior would make any partisan congressman see that as reason enough for such an article of impeachment compound that with an actual indictment and its guaranteed he said

you know i dont want to get into it because  if i win i dont want to be in a position where im saying to you and the other side now says we dont want trump involved trump said 
let me be sort of a neutral guy he continued a lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal so i dont want to say whose fault is it i dont think it helpstrump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a twostate solution given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time 
its possible its not makeable because dont forget it has to last  its wonderful to make it and it doesnt work but it has to last he said to make lasting peace there probably the toughest deal of all but im going to give it a shot 
though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate and what he considers the root of the conflict 
a lot of people say an agreement cant be made which is okay i mean sometimes agreements cant be made not good but you know you have both sides really but one side in particular growing up and learning that these are the worst people he said i was with a very prominent israeli the other day he says its impossible because the other side has been trained from the time theyre children to hate jewish peoplein the past trump has questioned israels commitment to peace while at the same time suggesting the jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the palestinians he has also called prime minister benjamin netanyahu a good friend 
at a presidential candidates forum hosted by the republican jewish coalition in december  the real estate magnate said i dont know that israel has the commitment to make it and i dont know that the other side has the commitment to make it 
he made the same point in an interview with ap earlier that day a lot will have to do with israel and whether or not israel wants to make the deal  whether or not israels willing to sacrifice certain things he said they may not be and i understand that and im okay with that but then youre just not going to have a deal

just as chemical sensitivities were discredited and denied by medical doctors for yearsnow referred to as sick building syndrome or multiple chemical sensitivity mcsso too is ehs now being recognized by many including the world health organization i introduce exhibit w electrohypersensitivity a functional impairment due to an inaccessible environment printout available here httpsdocsgooglecomvieweravpidforumssrcidmdgxodkwotknjuotuodqwntybmtuntizmdamtqxntynzintcbtvrzdgfeounbuufkataumqebdji 
as exhibit x i introduce a study no one can refute a review on electromagnetic fields emfs and the reproductive system which outlines science the microwave industry peco and all utilities utilizing ami smart meters plus public utility commissions across the usa need to factor into the inevitable legal liability that they are assuming by committing crimes against humanity by exposing the population to unsafe microwave electromagnetics  from dirty electricity pulsed by ami sms onto home wiring and into private residences and all buildings retrofitted with ami smart meters 
before i include my previously submitted testimony i find it necessary to impress upon the court that it should not be frompovichs obligation to prove the medical consequences beyond a reasonable doubt especially in light of the ada amendments act as it applies to those receiving federal funding or even that the consequences of medical problems are more probable than not since the adaaa provides frompovich with disability rights and protections which peco and the pa puc must abide by 
furthermore it should be the indisputable duty of peco and all pennsylvania utility companies  but more specifically that of the pa public utility commissions stated mission for being  to provide safe and nonradiating innovations in utility technology and appliances with  certainty which ami smart meters fail on numerous levels especially with their proclivity for hot sockets fires and explosions emfrf constant emissions and dirty electricity pulses as frequent as  times a day 
no medicalscientific testing has proved ami smart meters emfs safety regarding nonthermal adverse health effects that i know of wheres the science 
therefore frompovich should not be forced to allow a provenfireprone ami smart meter electric service on her property that would radiate dirty electricity into her residence with high rfr pulses every fifteen seconds 
just to add more salt to the wound as they would say there are no assurances that monitoring is not part and parcel of the ami smart meter agenda and an integral surveillance device of the internet of things or that information will be shared with unknown third partiesfor whatever reasonsand for which frompovich does not approve nor give her permission to peco the pa puc or any government agencies or agents 
therefore frompovich feels her privacy as well as her home and personal physiology will be subjected to unlawful unconstitutional and unnecessary interventions at various levels and specifically without proper legal processes eg courtissued warrants in order to surveil her home that automatically will occur from the twoway zigbee radio transmitter system of ami sms and all smart appliances which are built to interact with the coming surveillance technology of the internet of things the times frompovich makes tea in the morning and shuts off her lights for the night are no ones business but her own 
ive been researching consumer health issues and whatsoever affects human health negatively  including technologies since the late s during my career i was considered an expert witness providing testimony before several states legislaturelegislative hearings on health issues for numerous years i was ahead of both the popular curve and the allopathic paradigm of medicine regarding the role of diet nutrition epigenetics and lifestyle issues in maintaining optimum health avoiding disease and regaining health utilizing holistic health principles 
i am in my  th year thank god since the early s when i almost lost my life due to unfortunate medical mistakes and had to remove myself from mainstream allopathic care in order to save my life ive been immersed in whats called the holistic lifestyle ive beaten the odds including being a breast cancer survivor using holistic healthcare modalities for the record  of us adults and  of us children used whats referred to as cam in  per nih statistics complementary and alternative medicinecam as its called is popular throughout the world while in the us there is the national center for complementary and integrative health at the national institutes of health 
however the allopathic paradigm considers it quite frankly a pain in its professional butt since cam has become the go to healthcare system when allopathy fails one 
therefore i expect that i probably will educate misinformed individuals on the negative health consequences of electromagnetic frequencies from microwave energy producing technologies like cell phones and towers wifi smart gadgets and in particular ami smart meters which are being bullyforced onto electric natural gas and municipal water utility customers most state legislators the media and the public are undeniably ignorant of the damage being done to their health fortunately i am not one of those people thus my refusing an ami smart meter on my house but first i think you ought to know some of my background im a wellinformed plus over  years published consumer health researcher advocateactivist journalist and author 
that i should be taken seriously i offer some of my professional background retired practicing natural nutritionist former registered lobbyist with the us congress for five years representing holistic healthcare issues executive director for the national coalition for alternatives in nutrition and healthcare canah for five years and as such presented fdasolicited expertise input regarding holistic health practices for its  ota report otah ntis pb unconventional cancer treatments  expert nutrition witness before a congressional subcommittee opposing food irradiation government relations specialist for a consortium of natural nutrition supplement makers before the us food and drug administration the first government relations specialist for the life extension foundation who set up lefs government relations department a published journalist author of numerous books regarding health and lifestyle issues with several books available on amazoncom and my  book eat to beat disease foods medicinal qualities 
additionally i wrote and produced two tv shows one called  turn off the violence  was nominated for a telly award that hourlong show was instrumental in securing the giraffe award given to persons who stick out their necks for the common good the recipient was george mason university staff member connie kirkland who founded a hour crisis center for rape victims and promoted oncampus nonviolence educational campaigns specifically relating to rape and domestic violence what ive shared is much less than half of my background more would take too much of your time however i feel compelled to ask how many people can match my qualifications to discuss consumer health issues 
furthermore i want to underscore upfront that if i were a habitual drug addict rather than an informed concerned healthconscious researcher and consumer being harassed for trying to protect and preserve my health i probably would be welcomed with open arms plus there would be all types of programs and subsidies available for help because i am opposing faulty and healthdamaging rfemf science plus vestedinterest snooping surveillance and customer data marketing agendas using ami smart meters i am harassed and even threatened with termination of electric service even though all my bills are paid in full that leaves me with no options but to dutifully invoke and defend my state and federal constitutional rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness isnt there something radically wrong with such a construct especially in the usa if i have to do that 
attorney ward smiths interrogatory requesting frompovichs cancer health records quite frankly leaves everyone with whom ive shared that fact totally aghast and amazed why because frompovichs medical records are her personal information protected under hippa and i must protect them furthermore since the puc administrative law court hearing is of public record frompovich does not want her personal medical records made public information during any level in these proceedings as that is her fundamental right 
i respectfully bring to this courts attention that my breast cancer and medical records are not the issue whats the issue problem and at stake not only for me but for all pennsylvanians is the total callous disregard by utility companiespeco included the pa puc and the commonwealth for health hazards safety and the wellbeing of all pennsylvanians especially those with health issues compromised immune systems disabilities and especially young growing childrenfetuses in particularwhom rfemf and dirty electricity produced by ami smart meters affect and impact negatively 
before presenting into the record additional reams of recent research with documentation and annotationsnot s vintage radar safety researchfor rfsemfs and microwave electromagnetic energies impacts upon cancer and health i feel it necessary to introduce something no one probably has thought about nor factored into the ami smart meter hidden costs continuum  and that is healthcare services and ancillary costs stemming from nonionizing radiation rfsemfs smart meters impact upon human tissue 
there are mounting underlying longterm adverse health effects accruing as we speak from pa pucpeco forced ami smart meter  rfemf electromagnetics pulses harmonics and dirty electricity specifically adverse nonthermal health effects impacting children and an ageing pa population which will generate dire fiscal consequences plus responsibilities upon penna medicaid health cost line items in each years operating budget for the commonwealth 
to cement that forewarning i offer the world health organizations statistic approximately  of reported cases of ehs electromagnetic hypersensitivity were considered severe which means specialized caregiving that however does not include cancerinduced health issues from rfsemfs what kind of budget shortfall will ami smart meters adverse health effects eventually generate for pas legislature and governor to haggle about when weve seen whats been going on recently to get a state budget passed has anyone thought about that very real problem

usa usa usa they chanted together in the hilton ballroom as the results came in who needs polls they never gave him a chance but now we have it president donald trump not only were the polls spectacularly wrong who will ever trust this particularly bankrupt form of moralising presumptive analysis and telling us how we do and should feel but also the pundits who were not just arrogant about the fact that trump had no chance but also were hopelessly out of touch with what america was thinking across its societal spectrum what it wanted what was felt deep in its blood
it is a rejection of the liberal consensus the entire west has wallowed in since the s and a rejection of obama and the false hope he decried the impotent nature of us political leverage around the world and the rejection of brazen corruption and questionable ethics as typified by crooked hillary
the world must live with it democracy has spoken and theyre going to have to get over the words president trump some will head for the hills some will run to canada others will continue to cry but as obama said yesterday regardless of the result tomorrow the sun will still shine
this is a cry for american exceptionalism and like him or not trump typifies that he is committed to education and demands high performance selling well is an admirable skill for a president to have negotiating with congress internationally etc is exceptionally useful trump has taken beatings financially and come out smelling like a rose
trumps business experience involves negotiations with business leaders and even governments around the world and he likely has connections behind the scenes that surpass those of simply purely political candidates  this gives him keen realistic insights into economics in different parts of the world as well as additional avenues to pursue trade agreements and even perhaps some nuanced insights of particular financial weaknesses of possible global competitors not to mention experience and insight into the partnerships andor antagonism between different industries and particular governments
more trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired the significance of the gops attempted purge of donald trump trump turkey and police tyranny the crisis of imperialism finds political expression an america in denial this vote comes down to the reckoning that for too long politicians have sold the american people out to foreign nations and global industry what donald trump is doing is representing the absolute heartbreak and anger and frustration at a government gone mad and it seems the left completely underestimated that in their vitriol in crying nevertrump and portraying him as the devil incarnate
although it is entirely true that trump is ostentatious and has his mistakes he brings something to the presidential table no other candidate had before he speaks his mind
america clearly is sick of weasel politicians who are too afraid to say what people want to hear they want the facts straight
president trump isnt cut from the political class that class which is entrenched in its selfinterest and has let the country down time and time again ross perot once said that we need somebody to clean out the stables a corrupted ethically questionable president is therefore not the answer in order to accomplish that and im not talking about donald trump
trump is a pragmatist in an era of rapidly approaching chaos he is not a social engineer a think tanker who wants to please those lining his bank accounts the liberal democratic policies of obama us rep nancy pelosi us sen harry reid and their company created a climate that has led to this decision today
so what if his language is intemperate and insulting even lacking in nobility from time to time how can a true changemaker be straitjacketed by politically correct chains if he or she must express the will of the people uncomfortable concerns that lie dormant for far too long
obama won because conservative voters stayed home he had promise and he let so many down what did clinton have and that is why conservative voters had to get out and vote
trump prefers isolationism on a world scale clinton voted to take us to war in iraq and to overthrow libyas gaddafi all in the guise of being muscular

theodore roosevelt was born oct   his wife and mother died on valentines day feb   he wrote in his diary the light has gone out in my life depressed he left to ranch in the dakotas 
returning to new york he entered politics and rose to assistant secretary of the navy he resigned during the spanishamerican war organized the first volunteer cavalry the rough riders and captured cubas san juan hill elected vicepresident under william mckinley he became americas youngest president in  
republican theodore roosevelt was the first president to invite an africanamerican booker t washington to dine in the white house on oct   a southern democrat newspapers condemned him it as printed in the memphis scimitar the most damnable outrage which has ever been perpetrated by any citizen of the united states was committed yesterday by the president when he invited a n to dine with him at the white house it would not be worth more than a passing notice if theodore roosevelt had sat down to dinner in his own home with a pullman car porter but roosevelt the individual and roosevelt the president are not to be viewed in the same light 
in  theodore roosevelt warned the thought of modern industry in the hands of christian charity is a dream worth dreaming the thought of industry in the hands of paganism is a nightmare beyond imagining the choice between the two is upon us 
in  the new york bible society had theodore roosevelt write a message which was inscribed in a pocket new testament  book of psalms given to world war i soldiers the teachings of the new testament are foreshadowed in micahs verse micah vi  what more does the lord require of thee than to do justice and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god do justice and therefore fight valiantly against the armies of germany and turkey for these nations in this crisis stand for the reign of moloch and beelzebub on this earth love mercy treat prisoners well succor the wounded treat every woman as if she was your sister care for the little children and be tender to the old and helpless walk humbly you will do so if you study the life and teachings of the saviour may the god of justice and mercy have you in his keeping  signed theodore roosevelt

theodore roosevelt in his book fear god and take your own part ny george h doran co  wrote 
armenians  for some centuries have sedulously avoided militarism and war  are so suffering precisely and exactly because they have been pacifists whereas their neighbors the turks have not been pacifists but militarists t roosevelt fear god p   
armenians have been subjected to wrongs far greater than any that have been committed since the close of the napoleonic warsthe wars of genghis khan and tamerlane in asia yet this government has not raised its hand to do anything to help the people who were wronged  this course of national infamy  began when the last administration surrendered to the peace atanyprice people and started the negotiation of its foolish and wicked all inclusive arbitration treaties individuals and nations who preach the doctrine of milkandwater invariably have in them a softness of fiber which means that they fear to antagonize those who preach and practice the doctrine of bloodandiron t roosevelt fear god p  
american eyewitness of the fearful atrocities mr arthur h gleason new york tribune nov   serbia is at this moment passing under the harrow of torture and mortal anguish now the armenians have been butchered under circumstances of murder and torture and rape that would have appealed to an oldtime apache indian  
even to nerves dulled and jaded by the heapedup horrors of the past year and a half the news of the terrible fate that has befallen the armenians must give a fresh shock of sympathy and indignation let me emphatically point out that the sympathy is useless unless it is accompanied with indignation and that the indignation is useless if it exhausts itself in words instead of taking shape in deeds  if this people through its government had not shirked its duty  we would now be able to take effective action on behalf of armenia 
mass meetings on behalf of the armenians amount to nothing whatever if they are mere methods of giving a sentimental but ineffective and safe outlet to the emotion of those engaged in them  the principles of the peaceatanyprice men of the professional pacifists  will be as absolutely ineffective for international righteousness  this crowning iniquity of the wholesale slaughter of the armenians  must be shared by the neutral powers headed by the united states for their failure to protest when this initial wrong was committed  the devastation of poland and serbia has been awful beyond description and has been associated with infamies surpassing those of the dreadful religious and racial wars of the seventeenthcentury europe  
weak and timid milkandwater policy of the professional pacifists is just as responsible as the bloodandiron policy of the ruthless and unscrupulous militarist for the terrible recrudescence of evil on a gigantic scale in the civilized world the crowning outrage has been committed by the turks on the armenians they have suffered atrocities so hideous that it is difficult to name them atrocities such as those inflicted upon conquered nations by the followers of attila and of genghis khan 
it is dreadful to think that these things can be done and that this nation nevertheless remarks neutral not only in deed but in thought between right and the most hideous wrong neutral between despairing and hunted people people whose little children are murdered and their women raped and the victorious and evil wrongdoers  
i trust that all americans worthy of the name feel their deepest indignation and keenest sympathy aroused by the dreadful armenian atrocities i trust that they feel  that a peace obtained without  righting the wrongs of the armenians would be worse than any war  
wrongdoing will only be stopped by men who are brave as well as just who put honor above safety who are true to a lofty ideal of duty who prepare in advance to make their strength effective and who shrink from no hazard not even the final hazard of war if necessary in order to serve the great cause of righteousness when our people take this stand we shall also be able effectively to take a stand in international matters which shall prevent such cataclysms of wrong as have been witnesseson an even greater scale in armenia t roosevelt fear god pp  
in his book fear god and take your part  theodore roosevelt wrote 
christianity is not the creed of asia and africa at this moment solely because the seventh century christians of asia and africa had trained themselves not to fight whereas the moslems were trained to fight christianity was saved in europe solely because the peoples of europe fought 
if the peoples of europe in the th and th centuries and on up to and including the th century had not possessed a military equality with and gradually a growing superiority over the mohammedans who invaded europe europe would at this moment be mohammedan and the christian religion would be exterminated 
a contemporary of theodore roosevelt was the english author gk chesterton who wrote of western christian civilization the collected works of gk chesterton volume xx introduction and notes by james v schall ignatius press they seem entirely to forget that long before the crusaders had dreamed of riding to jerusalem the moslems had almost ridden into paris 
theodore roosevelt continued in fear god and take your part  wherever the mohammedans have had complete sway wherever the christians have been unable to resist them by the sword christianity has ultimately disappeared from the hammer of charles martel to the sword of jan sobieski christianity owed its safety in europe to the fact that it was able to show that it could and would fight as well as the mohammedan aggressor

thousands of angry chinese immigrants demonstrated in a paris suburb yesterday sun to demand police protection from muggers who they say prey on them because they are seen as easy targets 
the death of a yearold chinese tailor after being badly beaten in a robbery earlier this month has lent new urgency to the long running complaint that asian immigrants are systematically attacked and robbed in the french capital 
the chinese community is dying in silence read a slogan on a tshirt splashed with red to symbolise bloodstains worn by one demonstrator maike song 
he said he joined the protest in aubervilliers to pay homage to chaoling zhang the father of two who died on august  after being punched to ground in the northeastern suburb that is home to some  chinese immigrants 
no arrests have been made over the attack 
about  chinese residents of aubervilliers have been attacked and robbed since november according to the francochinese friendship association 
it is because of prejudices that chinese people are weak docile and wealthy said fang a young female student ive been attacked three times in three years and my friends are suffering the same thing some have moved away from this area because of it i dont go out with a handbag any more 
community workers say many muggings are committed by members of other minorities living in the area generally of arab or african origin 
paris officials corroborated the figures but declined to identify the robbers by ethnic origin 
many chinese immigrants own restaurants or shops and tend to be relatively welloff but are often reluctant to go to the police some victims have been illegal immigrants said dominique darden a social worker 
the chinese community of paris has held other protests in recent years over the attacks

David G. Brown,ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women,"why socalled intellectuals do more harm than good to society why socalled intellectuals do more harm than good to society 
andré is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   culture 
the existence of intellectuals is more ubiquitous today than ever many are those who contend for public attention credibility and money as a reward for their wits not to mention the very status of intellectual yet the existence of such people is far from selfevident for centuries traditional societies barely had anything or anybody that looked like modern intellectuals and this did not prevent them from lasting hundreds or even thousands of years 
so as we elaborate projects and ideas for reforming the depraved societies of the empire of nothinga necessary step if we want a lasting victoryan important question must be confronted do we need at all what has been called intellectuals during last centuries and if we do not what should we have instead the origin of modern intellectuals 
at the heart of modernity lies a deep crisis before it western europe was united by the same christian faith and a basic agreement on the place of economysubordinated to guilds and the rights of the average producer 
when modernity reared its philosophical head through rené descartes a prominent thinker of the seventeenth century the old continent was in a much more problematic state christianity had splintered into various opposing faiths whose intellectual opposition was shaking everything to the core we have been told that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a glorious new flourishing of intelligence but in fact thinkers who actually lived at this time had quite a different impression 
the irish bishop george berkeley  criticized how the practice of philosophy had become on his age synonymous with getting embroiled into thousand scruples prejudices and errors of sense a situation he attributed to the wrong use we make of our faculties likewise the scottish philosopher david hume  scolded his contemporaries for being too eager to criticize the systems of others for the sake of pushing their own on the scene that is a mutual hypercriticism that led to a general lack of certitude about everything 
there is nothing which is not the subject of debate and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions the most trivial question escapes not our controversy and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision disputes are multiplied as if everything was uncertain and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth as if everything was certain amidst all this bustle it is not reason which carries the prize but eloquence from hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds 
the first precursors were honest in their endeavour to solve the crisis descartes berkeley hume and many others genuinely sought a grand encompassing theory that could resume with all controversies but soon the very controversy became an institution a whole market of ideas was growing in which more and more lettrés started to see an opportunity to make a name thus earning fame social standing and sometimes money hume could not help himself soon after criticizing those who fed the crisis by attacking the others systems while promoting their own he was doing the same 
such was the socalled enlightenment the further undermining of any spiritual philosophical or cultural unity by ambitious individuals ready to hustle for notoriety they would be experts at flattering the powerful mocking the catholic church fiddle fashionable themes and witty prose and more than everything else rationalizing their activity as a progress the very expression enlightenment stems from their willingness to market themselves to the posterity the intellectuals bread and butter 
it can be noted that from the amateur gentlemen of the eighteenth century generations of scientists have sprang up some of these characters were mathematicians engineers doctors or dedicated observers of nature and they all contributed to improving general human power over matter  but make no mistake even science needs problems and unknown stuff to justify careers and research thus following a headlong rush dynamic at its side the literary intellectuals need more problems so they can have the opportunity to sell themselves through claiming they want to solve them 
the momentous crisis turned into a crisis structure and the structure turned into a mark of the modern west where god ceased to speak the modern talking head took more and more territory and wrote dozens of books trying to prove he was the embodiment of progress it doesnt matter if problems are genuine or artificial intellectuals need them like a blacksmith needs iron 
two typical intellectual characters are voltaire and émile zola both were gifted writers both were charming and witty both managed to write about matters that were actually relevant to their times and both have used a trial with political overtones to make a show of themselves not so incidentally both were french and participated to the furthering of a twisted literary chauvinism 
voltaire took advantage of various trials to claim that the defendants were accused because they were protestants inside a catholic country the infamous affaire calas  from the name of a father who was accused of having murdered his own son was used by the shrewd philosophe to sending pathetic letters to the upper crust of the society stirring the public opinion pressuring magistrates until the fatherwho had been convicted and executed after a thorough investigationwas rehabilitated two centuries and a half later young frenchmen are still taught voltaire was a champion of truth justice and reason whereas he was more like a playwright who peddled influence 
zola more than a century later did the same a jewishfrench captain alfred dreyfus  was convicted for high treason after he allegedly communicated secret documents to prussia years later some new evidence seemed to indicate that dreyfus was innocent and that another officer had leaked the documents at this very moment zola published an incendiary article jaccuse  where he spat on the judges and cried about the injustice of the affaire  eventually dreyfus was rehabilitatedand the army the patriots and the catholics were shamed through a neverending media discourse that casted them as villains of the whole story 
voltaire and zola played the same role in a narrative of the exact same kind we are taught about a situation of injustice where the majority of the population is oppressing an innocent group through an innocent individual and crooked institutions fortunately a heroic talking head rises miraculously converts the opinion to recognize the poor innocent victim as such the talking head is crowned as an awesome thinker beyond boundaries whereas some are fairly vilified as oppressors and the poor victims rehabilitation is also the victory of reason justice and progress 
thus the intellectuel in the most typical sense is a highly paradoxical creature who becomes taught in classes after having seemingly rebelled against dominant institutions teenagers are led to think that heroic and highly intelligent individuals can turn the tide of unfavourable opinion provided they follow a mysterious sense of history there have been a lot more intellectuals than the mere classics and often those rejected by the official narrative are more interesting than those inside whos gonna pay 
even if you are gifted with words and language being a talking head does not pay much would anyone be ready to pay you for giving an opinion no matter how elaborate on anything the problem of money is a good starting point to connect the dots voltaire was close from wealthy protestants bankers one of whom even helped him to obtain a house in geneva and zola was a rotschild protégé  both of them contributed to tarnish catholicism and most of their own people in other words they served interests that could pay themthey were sellouts 
today some bloggers happen to earn money as independents especially when they found themselves a niche yet independence is scarce way too many people would like to live from their wits and even more obtain recognition as intellectuals more than often intellectual types turn into teachers journalists or even marketersthus depending upon an institution that pays them 
in north america the war against whites and masculinity is massively subsidized  whether in the academic or in the media you wont easily find a job there if you take a critical stance on cultural marxism and in case you wouldnt be selfhating enough they are already replacing you with minority individuals who are rewarded for spewing wordy venom daily 
old marxism was wellaligned with the interests of intellectuals as a class not as individuals it handed them an official status and flattered their ego by casting them as the vanguard of progress keynesianism triumphed for the exact same reason as it justified the creation of a bloated state where modelobsessed nerds enjoy a tremendous power over those who produce actual wealth intellectual types historically joined the left because it gave them a status money and moral recognition 
but the whole marxist vocabulary of progress and emancipation dissimulated what seems glaring today namely that intellectuals were recognized and paid not because they were enlightened or bright but because they were an efficient tool of destruction 
the conservative right has often lacked a milieu for intellectual types the average conservative was reluctant to pay someone he saw as a parasite such a lack pushed a number of high iqs to the arms of the left who made an establishment out of them and paid them to enforce globalism antiwhiteness antimasculinity pathological altruism transgender madness politically correct repression and so on intellectuals were never paid to say the truth they were paid as tools who performed a primarily destructive social function 
if we happen to beat cultural marxism what shall we do with intellectual types if we are to dismantle globalism and build healthier societies we have to think about what we will replace the bobo leftist establishment the intellectual mediocrity and spinelessness of the average conservative is no solution a truly traditional society would likely have initiates something akin to high priests and knights in lieu of vacuous and coward talkers how exactly we go there or how exactly this could look today is another question conclusion 
the french essayist alain soral once famously said a journalist is either a whore or without a job this is even truer for most intellectuals sold as they are to a destructive left or more seldomly to the inefficient right 
culture is overrated what the mainstream refers to under that name is a giant matrix full of lies taboos and the snobbery of talking heads who end up lying to everyone or believing into their own bullshit no wonder why the shrewd robert greene advised to be an intense realist one must cultivate inner intuition and situational awareness not to fall prey to some of the claptrap that constitutes at least eighty per cent of current mainstream culture 
the previous generations could join the cultural marxist establishment and pretend their destructive egoladen works were progress to our generation this is impossible either we stand up for our very existence even if we must go against more than two centuries of manipulations and lies or we resign ourselves to an ignominious death before we take the power back a shared awareness must be stimulated and this is where we enter in direct conflict with the wellfunded antiwhite antimasculine establishment types whom we must beat on their own field once and for all bonus  quotes about the intellectuels 
some of the problems that modern philosophical thinking puts forward appear void of any importance and meaning modern philosophy features a range of issues that merely stem from an equivocal stance and the confusion of different viewpoints these issues only exist because they are poorly framed they have no fundamental reason to exist in many cases defining their statements more precisely may be enough to make them disappear plain and simple if modern philosophy did not strive to maintain them because it makes a living out of ambiguity  rené guénon introduction to the study of the hindu doctrines  chap rené guénon young 
philosophers care much more about putting forth problems no matter how artificial and illusory than about solving them they also strive to link their name to a system that is to a strictly bounded set of theories they would own and consider as their nothing more than their own work hence the desire to be original at any price even if the truth must be sacrificed on the altar of said originality a philosopher who cares about his repute does better by making up a new mistake than by repeating some truth that has already been expressed by others rené guénon the crisis of the modern world  chap rené guénon older 
the most evident feature of modern critique is the lack of principles and of authenticity its greater preoccupation consists in being brilliant in appearing original from the point of view of those who embody this intellectuality the catchy line the dialectical or polemical posturing well noticed by others have a much greater value than truth ideas when they use them are nothing but a pretext what matters is to look intelligentjust as to the mainstream politician the ideology of a party is essentially a means for career the vanity fair the most deleterious subjectivism often verging on pure and unmitigated narcissism are essential components of this phenomenon the critique is a scourge of modern culture an epidemic that was born out of bourgeois society concomitantly with the commodification of culture in normal traditional civilizations one could find creators artists and those who would judge the works without intermediaries the sovereigns the patrons and the people our times have witnessed the appearance between the public and the creators that cultural pimp that cheeky and presumptuous parasite we call a critique  julius evola the bow and the club baron giulio cesare evola

nato and washingtons activities in eastern europe and the baltics de facto amount to permanent military presence sergei ermakov a senior analyst at the russian institute for strategic studies told rt adding that we have seen only the tip of the iceberg so far endless wargames and rotational deployments essentially amount to permanent military presence nato is testing a drastic military buildup we have witnessed the alliance deploy expeditionary forces and assault troops to eastern europe these are offensive not defensive forces what we have seen is only the tip of the iceberg ermakov said 
the north atlantic alliance has pledged to refrain from deploying substantial forces along the natorussia border on a permanent basis but has been increasingly active in the region the bloc approved its largest military buildup in eastern europe and the baltics since the end of the cold war at the  warsaw summit a development viewed with deep concern in moscow 
as part of this initiative canada germany the uk and the us will establish and lead four battle groups expected to be deployed in poland estonia latvia and lithuania each will total up to  soldiers these battalions are said to become operational in early  the alliance has justified its massive buildup by blaming russia for its ostensibly assertive behavior moscow has consistently denied these groundless claims 
ermakov further explained that forces of natos european members are not as lethal as they might seem on paper this is a force exceeding russias military potential by several times but it lacks real combat power this is why americans need to be everywhere the us was forced to boost us european commands budget he said 
earlier this year the pentagon requested bn for its operations in europe in  a fourtime increase compared to its million budget this year a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
russian officials and experts have repeatedly pointed out that nato increasing assertiveness has put regional stability at risk 
the blocs muscle flexing and aggressive rhetoric greatly reduce european security and the chances for a revival of constructive dialogue between russia and nato something russia has been calling for so many years instead the bloc is doing its best to provoke an arms race with unpredictable results peter korzun an expert on wars and conflicts wrote for the strategic culture foundation ermakov also said that the united states wants to increase its presence in the black sea region to counter russia americans can no longer count on turkey due to the failed coup attempt ankara has become a complicated partner washington is instead focusing on bulgaria and romania he said 
nato secretary general jens stoltenberg mentioned romania during a press conference held following the latest meeting of natos defense ministers he said that romanian troops will join the usled battle group in poland he also said that the ministers discussed progress made in strengthening natos presence in the black sea region in the air at sea and on land this initiative will include among other things a romanianled multinational framework brigade on land he observed providing no additional information on the subject

Mike Rivero,snow reports from around the northland duluth through  am saturday,"election crossroads socialism or capitalism exclusive jane chastain explains impact of dems living wage proposal published  mins ago about   archive jane chastain is a southern californiabased broadcaster author and political commentator despite her present emphasis on politics jane always will be remembered as the nations first female tv sportscaster spending  years on the sports beat jane blogs at janechastaincom she is a pilot who lives on a private runway print 
our country is at a crossroads never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road one road the one favored by politician hillary clinton and her democratic colleagues promises to lead us to a socialist utopia the other favored by businessman donald trump and some of his republican colleagues promises to get us back on the road toward freemarket capitalism 
it is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system in this system they control the lions share of our money and in turn hand out favors in this system they make the major decisions that affect our lives as the government accumulates more and more power we invariably end up with less statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power the more of our hardearned money he or she spends yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again expecting a different result 
weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the freemarket system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world no it isnt perfect but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life 
notice what i didnt say is simply willing to work hard there is the belief by some that if you simply work hard you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs which is around  a year in some parts of the country the democrats want to replace the minimum wage which is a training wage with this living wage that completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently 
ideally it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does 
unfortunately this socalled living wage will destroy jobs it will cause companies to automate and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate 
but this living wage is only part of what the democrats want to do in the name of fairness 
this no doubt appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better 
wages have remained flat for far too long but the democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators 
most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes they are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices and when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high such as weve seen in obamacare there is a large outcry thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services thats when the door to socialismcommunism slams shut 
they tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear our benevolent government will take care of us they are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve and if we dont get that job the government is going to give us free health care free food and free housing under president hillary there will be free child care free preschool and paid family leave what a country 
if we dont reach our goals everything will be ok because social security and medicare will be there to finance our retirement and if that isnt enough the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television 
what about the fact that social security and medicare are going broke how long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses they never talk about that 
as british prime minister margaret thatcher once said the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money 
dont be fooled this election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket its an important fork in the road one fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom the other offers a free lunch

Jason Easley,the top democrat in the senate just accused fbi director james comey of breaking the law,"society naza says the upcoming full moon will appear up to  percent bigger and  percent brighter than usual 
the brightest moon in almost  years will be lighting up the night sky this week in a treat for star watchers around the globe 
the phenomenon known as the supermoon will reach its zenith in asia and the south pacific on monday night 
it will then reach its most brightest mode in north america before dawn on monday 
across the international dateline in new zealand it will reach its brightest after midnight on tuesday local time 
if skies are clear the upcoming full moon will appear up to  percent bigger and  percent brighter than usual according to nasa this image shows a near full moon in aravica arizona on october   photo by afp 
the moons distance from earth varies because it is in an eggshaped not circular orbit around the planet 
since the moons orbit is elliptical one side perigee is about  kilometers closer to earth than the other apogee 
the word syzygy is the scientific term used for when the earth sun and moon line up as the moon orbits earth 
when perigeesyzygy of the earthmoonsun system occurs and the moon is on the opposite side of the earth from the sun we get a perigee moon which is more commonly known as supermoon 
this coincidence already happened one time on october  
on november  and december  it happens again as the moon becomes full on the same day as perigee on november  it becomes full within about two hours of perigeearguably making it an extra supermoon

Letsbereal,no title,"lately gunfree zones and gun control laws are all the rage among the globalists and liberals of all shapes usually circular and sizes 
those measures solely aimed at disarming the people and depriving them of the sacred right to defend themselves has shown its vast ineffiency with gun victims and terrorist attacks on the rise in those zones since no honest citizen can shoot back to stop the massacre
here is why i propose once a conservative government reaches the white house to create fat control laws fcl and obesityfree zones ofz as obesity is indeed a more serious threat to the lives of americans than honest citizens carrying legally purchased guns here are six potential benefits
 simple philanthropy 
obese people are delusional thinking that it is great to be a useless sack of shit nowadays they get fed a distorted reality saying that big and round is beautiful when the natural reaction deeply branded in our dna is disgust mockery and suspicion
fat and sedentary lifestyles kill much more than guns  the war against obesity is as important as the war on crime or drugs bovine people not only harm themselves but others too by creating measures to prevent them from becoming fat or exhorting them lose weight we are helping our common man to preserve his dignity as a human being
in their case sugar and salt create a dopamine rush and an addiction loop very similar to an addiction to opiates we must show our potbellied or barrelbellied junkies the way as they cant take the steps themselves
just like with restrictions on cigarettes if they are stupid enough to gorge themselves on calories we must conclude that there is a severe lack of judgement on their part and prevent them from purchasing the source of their misery
 preserving aesthetics and other senses 
no more eyesore of seeing fatties rolling around everywhere you go imagine a beach with a plethora of more feminine attractive and thin women by banning whales in bikinis
our nostrils would also be free of the olfactory offence that they throw in our faces say goodbye to the pungent smell of fat rolls sweat at your local grocery store
no more lb sjw land whales with laboured breath sounds in waiting rooms or uncontrolled farting in the public transport like you are in a cattle train it could be tomorrow
 positive impact on children 
i do not want these people to roam free and that my future progeny can witness it and think that this is normal worse if the pc politburo tells them it is beautiful to be a beached whale lets send them far until they get better out of sight out of mind as they say
legal elements should be implemented against pernicious publicity aired on television and directly aimed at children whether by the time chosen to air it or the promotion it makes of unhealthy eating
of course with fat control policies kids will get bullied at school some will cut themselves for being called fattie so what adapt and overcome or crawl in a ball and cry the weakest has to be left behind if he does not want to save himself
 a healthier population you are under arrest for being an immovable gargantuan arsehole
fat is not a silent killer hundreds of thousands of people die with a loud thud every year of obesityrelated diseases a largely preventable cause of death worldwide today  in  americans and  in  britons dies from being a fat arse with no selfcontrol
it is a fact that obesity causes death by cardiac arrest diabetes coronary and liver diseases cancer and hypertension among others promoting a healthy lifestyle and physical activity will create a longer life expectancy
physically healthier people are mentally healthier too boost of selfesteem and confidence fat control laws will reduce mental health issues such as depression inferiority complex or suicidal tendencies caused by obesity that is also less money spent by the taxpayer
 a boost for the economy 
according to a  report ham planets cost the economy  billion a year  and that is for the american economy alone the number of human cattle is still growing exponentially it inflicted more than a  billion loss to the economy in 
in  we can reasonably assume that the number of obese people has grown and has impacted the wallet of your average american even harder
a fitter population with its nutritional choices would result in a more natural higherquality food industry smaller amounts of food produced and needed resulting in reduced resources and materials wasted during and after its production
we could see the end of excessive fossil fuel used to transport land walruses and their fat arse across long distances and hogging the space that could be use by three normal individuals
healthier more active people are happier more productive and successful since the cogs of the machinery are not coated in fat an age of stronger selfgoverned highenergy men bringing a healthier society its yuge
 a new sexual and romantic market 
it will bring a more balanced sexual arena to limit the accumulation of fat a radical answer to the phenomenon of plummeting testosterone levels caused by high fat percentage trimming the numbers of plump omegas and sexual market voluntary rejects
lets impose a healthier diet for higher numbers of attractive thin and pretty women greater numbers of quality girls to choose from reduces aggressive competition which decreases the bitch shields of thin entitled girls
endless supplies of betas queuing to capture crumbs of their attention would be a thing of the past as i said it before male thirst is the root of all evil when it comes to romantic competition
sexier citizens means more relationships a peak in libido and reproduction of physically and mentally balanced individual helping nations suffering from low birth rate
one more element for the protection of western society being the most affected one and its people cementing the bases of a strong future fighting globalism and the myth they try to sell us about global overpopulation
by logical natural process bronies corpulent manchildren and manga conventions should also disappear soon
the fat control laws  segregated obesityfree zones 
our diabetic mammoths must be isolated from further propaganda and tasty treats
this is why we should create large very large fenced areas to protect the healthy subjects as fat is more dangerous than guns
lets pen the bigboned rejects in separated zones where access to junk food and other harmful products would be forbidden fresh water open spaces salad and treadmills as far as the eye could see
build that fence
we shall call it the david fatrelle center for porcine rehabilitation
 permits 
a permit would have to be issued similar to a guncarrying permit for the purchase of junk food highcarb snacks soda drinks etc after a doctors physical exam of the patient slim citizens would be delivered a permit with a stamp of approval granting them access to supermarkets or venues where processed or junk food is served
 mandatory workouts 
compulsory exercise would be imposed to obese people to reach a standard bmi we could bring it up a notch where a fine could be issued after a determined period of time if the weight loss target has not been reached
a steps counter activity tracker would have to be worn or installed on their smartphone and a quota of physical activity would have to be reached on a day to day basis
just like the programs for convicted criminals or drug abusers with reports to the local police station on a regular basis the stubbornly chunky would be followed during a rehabilitation stage and their progress monitored
 fat shaming 
fat shaming works great as we have seen before  remember the shitstorm of the beach body campaign  immediately declared thought criminals by the body positive lobby or islamic thought tribunal of londonistan
or the coldblooded leaflets given by anonymous though criminals to particularly adipose london tube passengers yuge success
pourquoi ça nexiste pas 
fat people are a dead weight to society in all senses of the term and to compensate this burden they must chip in one way or another and repair the harm they cause
fitter people means a selfaware powerful mass that strives for greatness
but the liberals in charge dont want that this is why they produce massive amounts of harmful processed food and encourage the pleb by manipulating publicity and promoting makebelieve to remain fat weak and above all docile
its all part of a plan fat control laws are the answer to that great evil

Dr. Majid Rafizadeh,weird bans on women in iran,"bill clinton inc billions for the foundation  million for the clintons october   
call it the unintended revenge of doug band 
band used to be bills huma the guy that the big guy couldnt go to the bathroom without let alone perform the simplest tasks the clinton foundation was a band project the waters grew murkier but the recent email leaks revealed a rather devastating doug band memo on how he was making money for the whole infrastructure of what he called running bill clinton inc 
and band was also organizing personal income directly for clinton under the heading forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc band wrote we have dedicated our selves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activitiesincluding speeches books and advisory service engagements in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his familyfor personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president clinton to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements 
band mentions four such arrangements without naming them bill clinton was paid nearly  million to be honorary chancellor of a forprofit college laureate international universities according to reports and the familys tax returns a dubaibased firm gems education paid bill clinton more than  in  according to the tax returns band also lists a variety of speaking fees previously disclosed by the clintons including hundreds of thousands of dollars each from ubs ericsson bhp and barclays in  alone according to the clintons tax returns bill clinton earned  in speaking fees 
of course there was lots of synergy between the for profit stuff and the non profit stuff between dougs teneo interests and the entire clintonworld octopus 
we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities band wrote he also said he had sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation 
bands memo provided data showing how much money each of teneos  clients at the time had given to the clinton foundation how much they had paid bill clinton and in some cases how he or kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments 
band wrote that teneo partners had raised in excess of  million for the foundation and  million in paid speaking fees for bill clinton he said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out  million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place 
band also described how kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with ubs global wealth management introducing bill clinton to a top executive at a  charity dinner in the ensuing years ubs upped its giving to the foundation signed on as a teneo client and agreed to pay bill clinton for speeches band wrote 
band was actually making the case that the entire network of the clinton foundation is completely entangled with the private financial interests of the clintons not to mention the interests of people around them 
banks and major corporations were doing business with bills toady paying bill money and donating to the clinton foundation through arrangements made by the party of the first part 
band described in the memo how he combined his work for cgi and teneo he wrote that he had used a hotel room upstairs from the  cgi gathering to meet with teneo clients he also acknowledged giving free cgi memberships to target teneo clients being cultivated as potential foundation donors memberships generally cost  a year 
teneo meanwhile named bill clinton its honorary chairman clinton had been initially tapped for a threeyear arrangement in which he would provide advice to teneo regarding geopolitical economic and social trends according to a separate june  memo that band wrote to the state department seeking ethics approval for the former presidents employment 
bill clinton was initially paid  million by teneo according to man of the world a book written with the former presidents participation by author joe conason 
and heres where it gets appropriately entertaining 
but band outlined that kelly his teneo cofounder had served simultaneously between  and  as an unpaid economic envoy to northern ireland appointed by thensecretary of state hillary clinton and as head of a separate consulting company whose clients included coke ubs and dow band wrote that the arrangement was consistent with kellys state department ethics agreement 
kellys multiple roles came together during one state department event in  when thensecretary clinton recognized dow among other companies for creating jobs in northern ireland and thanked kelly for his work on the issue

by roberta rampton 
daytona beach fla reuters  heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign democratic candidate hillary clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states 
jennifer lopez will headline a free concert for clinton supporters in miami on saturday giving the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach  and some visual counterprogramming to the latest email controversy to roil her race for the white house 
the federal bureau of investigation said on friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into clintons use of a private email system  a latebreaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up to the nov  vote 
celebritydriven events like the concert can serve as a bit of a distraction from the controversy said eric kasper a political scientist at the university of wisconsineau claire 
it is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive kasper said 
the jlo concert is the first in a series next week clinton will take the stage with jay z in cleveland and then with katy perry in philadelphia on nov  
a harvard university poll this week showed that among likely voters aged  to  clinton is leading republican rival donald trump a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show the apprentice 
but turnout is a concern the exceptionally negative tone of this years race for the white house has soured young americans on politics reutersipsos polling shows 
presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals said tevi troy who chronicled the strategy in his book what jefferson read ike watched and obama tweeted  years of pop culture in the white house 
campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture said troy a presidential historian who worked in the george w bush white house 
the events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign a way to show a groundswell of support behind a candidate  and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians said kasper who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics 
it can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate for instance kasper said

two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered nfl fan the game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage 
democrats can be counted upon to call the republican opponent racist whether the opponent is the priestly mitt romney or the supreme court justice who wrote the dred scott decision donald trump you see is racist because among other reasons at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my africanamerican hillary clinton on the other hand is not antisemitic even though three witnesses one of whom took and passed a polygraph claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a fing jew bastard 
with a republican candidate the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small real or imagined  while giving the democrat a pass so trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of clintons flatout lie during the third debate when she insisted that the supreme court heller case was about toddlers as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms 
in heller nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear clinton a year ago flatout said the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment to normal people this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on which again was whether we as individuals have a right to keep and bear arms 
meanwhile we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal when the accurate description is national security scandal the espionage act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters the law does not require as fbi director james comey falsely stated an intent nor is it relevant as clinton insists whether or not her private server the one she maintained in her basement was hacked 
five people who worked with or for clinton including her chief of staff all received immunity deals something normally given to get someone to flip on a target some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed but the target that is to say hillary clinton was deemed by comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted so why the immunity deals who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned who cares 
clinton insists that president obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy this would be the economy in which for the first time in history a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least  percent growth in gross domestic product this would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that gallup ceo jim clifton calls the big lie given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are underemployed 
meanwhile its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed groped touched or made fun of by trump has appeared with her attorney feminist gloria allred allred a clinton supporter sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of trumps sexual misconduct and her support for clinton who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers one such accuser juanita broaddrick claims not only that she was raped by bill clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape hillary clinton verbally threatened her 
hillary clinton mind you has never been asked by anyone in the media about broaddricks allegation never and only one national reporter sam donaldson has ever asked bill clinton about juanita broaddricks allegation ever clintons answer he referred donaldson to his lawyer david kendall donaldson quickly tried again asking the thenpresident to simply deny it same answer my attorney  speaks for me and that was that 
so hillary clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since  who has clearly violated the espionage act and placed the nations security at risk who told the benghazi victims families that the death of four americans was inspired by a video while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different whose charitable foundation engaged in paytoplay in haiti so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and nondonors went to the back of the line who wants to gut the second amendment who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of isis russia and the chinese and whose media compadres including scribes with the new york times washington post and cnbc have been outed by wikileaks as colluding with her campaign and she is now oddson favorite to become the next president of the united states receive larry elders commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for larry elders alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",wnd.com,Real,english,97.12303591710229,83.52880693399604,93,14,5334,911,4.835345773874863,911.0,0.9490732605522584,0.7374756820870908,0.62311984610277,0.6502023483211784,-0.2504523359230851,0.677001243292034,0.0021953896816684,0.0,0.0,0,2,0.0,0.0054379069413811,-0.9851,0.092,0.115,0.793,Negative,Very Strong

saturday night live has helped bring quite a bit of levity to this otherwise horrific election year but in the final episode before the election before we as a nation go to the polls and decide if we want to be extraordinary or deplorable the cast of saturday night live could not help but drop the act and get real with america 
it began as it normally does with alec baldwins masterful donald trump character and kate mckinnons excellent portrayal of hillary clinton if she spent all day every day mainlining a dangerous mixture of sugar and caffeine 
i never use emails trump says in the cold opener i use a very private very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it its called twitter 
after he is informed that everyone can see his tweets trump replies 
really and im still in this thing america you must really hate this lady 
after a scathing rebuke of the medias decision to ignore trumps cozy relationship with putin the kkk and the fbi and instead focus on something as meaningless as hillary clintons emails something magical happened mckinnon and baldwin dropped the facade and got serious 
im sorry kate i just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this baldwin says i just feel gross all the time about this dont you all feel gross he added addressing the audience 
mckinnon agrees and the two embark on a friendship montage through the city before returning to the stage then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year none of this would have mattered if you dont vote baldwin says 
we cant tell you who to vote for but on tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in mckinnon finishes

Truth Detector,comment on if clinton goes down loretta lynch will go down with her by truth detector,"posted by michael snyder 
i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate 
in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  
so what should the democrats do now 
if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process 
they would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place 
democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea 
but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th 
if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill 
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed 
so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee 
who would they choose 
lets take a look at the top five options 
 tim kaine 
he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him 
and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens 
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee 
 joe biden 
vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it 
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run 
but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau 
unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does 
biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers 
biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice 
 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders 
first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over 
secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this 
thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election 
so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list 
 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman 
so she is definitely a possibility 
but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies 
 michelle obama 
one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton 
and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think 
michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  
the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title 
when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her 
if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump 
of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point 
and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her 
in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen 
and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down

Alex Ansary,carter reveals upgrades to us long range rocket,"half of russians fear syria could spark ww  
russia today almost half of all respondents in a recent russian opinion poll said they feared that the aggravation of relations between russia and the west caused by the ongoing crisis in syria could develop into a global military conflict 
the share of those who see the probability of world war three in the near future as high or very high is now at  percent and those who appraise it as low or very low comprise  percent of society the privatelyowned public opinion research center levada reported on monday the remaining  percent of respondents said they couldnt give a simple answer to the question 
when researchers asked citizens if they considered it possible that russia and the west would eventually find a mutually acceptable solution to the crisis  percent answered that this scenario was likely or very likely thirtynine percent evaluate the probability of such an outcome as low or very low and  percent said that they couldnt answer the question 
just over half   percent  of russians said they approve of their countrys involvement in the syrian conflict and  percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this just under a quarter   percent  couldnt answer the question about their personal view on the subject those who thought that russia should continue the operation and those who thought that airstrikes should be stopped were divided  percent against  percent respectively with  percent finding the question too difficult to answer 
the level of awareness about the situation in syria and the russian air force operation against islamic state is formerly isisisil terrorists there remained fairly high eighteen percent said they were very closely following developments in syria and  percent revealed partial familiarity with the issue just under a fifth   percent  said that they were not interested in news about syria 
a similar poll conducted a year ago by the independent levada center showed that over  percent of russian citizens supported the air operations against is terrorists in syria and almost a half of them agreed that it was right for russia to support the government of syrias democraticallyelected president bashar assad

Mike Rivero,flashback  hillary clintons kkk smear against trump was democrat strategy,"november   by wire leave a comment 
the person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the white house it may well be donald j trump but further due diligence is required to ensure that american democracy is not threatened 
st century wire says 
although the election was called on nov th the democratic partys ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming president is still ongoing 
for those of us with long enough memories the democratic party their media operatives and the clinton campaign were claiming that trump and the gop would be engaged in this very same behavior after hillary clinton won the presidency as expected 
notice how the shoe is now on the other foot 
its interesting reading past stories by news sources linked to the clinton campaign and john podesta as politico has who ran a feature on aug th entitled why the gop will never accept president hillary clinton which lays out the case of hillarys lock on the white house and how the evil republicans will not accept her eventual election victory 
will donald trump respect the peaceful transition of power howled cnns wolf blitzer in the runup to the election the question now is will the democrats respect the result and simply move on as they say 
of course we now know that journalists like wolf at cnn were getting their talking points directly the clinton campaign  
as it turns out the only thing illegitimate about the  election was the mainstream corporate media

a growing number of academics and activists are calling for us authorities to fully audit or recount the  presidential election vote in key battleground states in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers 
the loose coalition which is urging hillary clintons campaign to join its fight is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week according to two people involved 
the document which is currently  pages long focuses on concerns about the results in the states of michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin 
im interested in verifying the vote said dr barbara simons an adviser to the us election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting we need to have postelection ballot audits simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement 
a second group of analysts led by the national voting rights institute founder john bonifaz and professor alex halderman the director of the university of michigans center for computer security and society is also taking part in the push for a review and has been in contact with simons 
in a blogpost early on wednesday halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching 
unfortunately nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now in the next several days to petition for recounts he said 
the developments follow clintons surprise defeat to donald trump in the  november vote and come after us intelligence authorities released public assessments that russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from democratic officials before the election

one of norways nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine monday morning according to the norwegian radiation protection authority nrpa  
in a statement released today the nrpa said 
the radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall emissions are low 
experts say contamination levels around the institute for energy technology in the southern town of halden were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public 
said per strand deputy directorgeneral at the nrpa a government regulator 
of course its an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk this is not the sort of leak we want  
the radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility 
staff were evacuated from the institute but later returned donning protective gear to assess the cause and extent of the leak and halt it 
a senior nrpa official said the incident would maybe be rated a  on the international nuclear event scale which rates nuclear incidents from  to  by comparison the incidents at fukishima and chernobyl were ranked   source the government of the hong kong special administrative region 
regulatory officials were frustrated that they were not notified about the leak until today  atle valseth a research director at the institute for energy technology agreed he said 
i dont sit so close to those decisions but i think we should have informed the authority yesterday we will have to go through why it wasnt reported  it wasnt good enough that we didnt report it yesterday  
strand the head of safety preparedness and environment at the nrpa expressed the regulators frustration 
we need to gather more information  but we are not happy with the situation that we were not warned immediately we will investigate further  
the swiss radiation safety authority srsa said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility which sits close to the swiss border 
mark foreman a nuclear expert at the chalmers university of technology in sweden stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel which is contained within a ceramic material the ceramicwrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut the tube is inside the reactor 
the iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall

Alex Ansary,china airport security robot gives electroshocks,"suspect captured in ambushstyle killings of two iowa cops  
usa today 
authorities captured a yearold male suspect without incident wednesday hours after an earlymorning ambushstyle killing of two police officers in the des moines metro area 
the suspect in the backtoback killings was identified as scott michael greene said urbandale police spokesman sgt chad underwood before capturing him police had described greene who was last seen driving a blue ford f with an iowa license plate as armed and dangerous 
greene was taken into custody by the dallas county sheriffs department while walking along a rural road in redfield about  miles west of where the shootings occurred 
according to police greene flagged down a passing department of natural resources officer handed over his id and told the officer to call police no shots were fired and there was no struggle according to police 
the suspect was taken by ambulance to a des moines hospital with an unknown injury 
in a late morning news conference police identified the slain officers as urbandale police officer justin martin and des moines police sgt anthony tony beminio 
the attacks began around  am ct when police departments from both cities responded to reports of gunfire at the intersection of th street and aurora avenue in urbandale 
the first officers arriving on the scene found martin fatally wounded about  minutes later some two miles away beminio was was shot near the intersection of merle hay road and sheridan ave while responding to reports of the first officers shooting beminio was transported to iowa methodist medical center where he died scott michael greene photo des moines police 
both officers were gunned down in their patrol cars 
it doesnt look like there was any interaction between these officers and whoever the coward is that shot them while they sat in their cars a visibly emotional parizek told reporters 
in all appearances it looks  that these officers were ambushed he added officer from des moines and another from urbandale were shot and killed in their cars dmpolice said officersdown 
 daniel p finney newsmanone november   
des moines police fearing officers were being singled out paired up its patrol officers so none were on the street alone parizek said 
theres literally a clear and present danger if youre a police officer he said 
police did not offer many details on how investigators identified greene as a suspect underwood said he was identified through a series of leads and a series of investigative tips 
as of an earlymorning news conference police were still notifying the family members of the slain officers and planned to withhold the officers names years of service and other details until later in the day parizek said 
attorney general loretta lynch condemned the killings saying violence has no place in the united states of america 
let me be clear there is no message in murder the attorney general said referring to simmering distrust between law enforcement and many communities across the country violence creates nothing it only destroys a des moines police officer was found fatally shot in a vehicle near the intersection of merle hay road and sheridan avenue in des moines on wednesday nov   photo brian powers the des moines register 
its the first time des moines has seen a police officer shot and killed in the line of duty since two officers were gunned down in separate incidents in  
two des moines officers susan farrell and carlos puentemorales died earlier this year when their vehicle was struck headon by a wrongway drunk driver 
the killing of the urbandale officer appeared to be the citys first for an officer shot in the line of duty underwood said at the news conference 
parizek thanked the community for its support when the department lost farrell and puentemorales as well as with this tragedy 
i dont even know where to begin on how bad this year is he said but this is what we do we come in day in and day out we go out there and provide the same level of service regardless of whats going on in our personal and professional lives officers investigate the scene at merle hay and sheridan ave where an officer was found shot at about  am on on wednesday nov   in urbandale 
in a statement iowa gov terry branstad called the attack on the officers an attack on the public safety of all iowans 
we call on iowans to support our law enforcement officials in bringing this suspect to justice he said our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the police officers who were tragically killed in the line of duty as well as the officers who continue to put themselves in harms way 
iowa sen joni ernst extended her thoughts and prayers to the families of the officers killed 
although the investigation is still unfolding what appears to be an ambush attack of police in the line of duty is an attack on the community at large and all of the men and women who risk their lives every day to protect us ernst said this was a senseless act of violence and it cannot be tolerated

democratic us vicepresidential nominee tim kaine announced saturday that he believes the catholic church will change its position on samesex marriage the virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue the catholic church is also likely to follow suit speaking at the th annual human rights campaigns national dinner in washington the roman catholic senator reportedly said i think its going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who in the first chapter of genesis surveyed the entire world including mankind and said it is very good 
and besides he continued we are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value by definition that means that every single person and every single citizen is able  no scratch that  encouraged to practice his civil religious and above all sexual liberties to the best of their abilities and im sorry that some people dont like it but to deny samesex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless and the catholic church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it which is what its doing right now 
kaine also added that if all else fails there are ways of making the catholic church listen to the voice of reason which is how he dubbed all those who advocate lgbt equality at the end of the day you know were a civilized people of course the first thing well do is act nicely and ask nicely he said then if that doesnt work well use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are or rather the lbgt community will do that  and it has the supreme courts ruling on samesex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works it actually functions 
so what im saying here he argued is that while i respect the catholic church as im sure millions of americans do you know at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the christian faith and were talking about an institution thats supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it so when that happens and thats whats happening with condemning lgbt rights well state an ultimatum the united states of america more precisely the future president of the united states of america hillary clinton will state an ultimatum and that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on samesex marriage or pack its bags and get out of america and yes  the president of the country can do that 
and in case anybodys wondering  no donald trump wont do the same because he doesnt care about anyone other than donald trump on the other hand hillary clinton is a shining example of honesty integrity and democracy and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout america are loved respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term what happens after that is not our problem kaine concluded",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,74,12,2937,525,4.575238095238095,525.0,0.3681475130336877,0.3616742515005802,-0.0110584457326234,0.0450775633565519,-0.5071531058079708,0.0577288782288952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9975,0.166,0.032,0.802,Positive,Very Strong

the signing of the comprehensive economic trade agreement with canada ceta on the th of october marks the beginning of north americas annexation of europe the negotiations for the treaty were carried out behind closed doors for over  deputies in the european parliament there are more than  thousands lobbyists the society for european affairs professionals seap  the organisation which lobbying on behalf of multinational corporations  this is the real power block in europe the european worker has absolutely no say and henceforth he will lose the right to form join unions multinational corporations will have unlimited power over european workers who will see the destruction of what is left of social gains won from over a century of class struggle
will european workers lie down and accept this imposture what concrete policies would weaken the stranglehold of corporations over european workers which parties in the current political landscape hold policies which if implemented would weaken the transatlantic stranglehold
there are currently no political parties running in the major european elections with candidates who genuinely represent workers interests but there are some political movements which threaten the corporate powerelite we will mention them below
there are two important geopolitical processes to consider here the first is the eastwest corporate  geopolitical axis america is pulling the european peninsula away from the eurasian continent with the installation of a neonazi regime in kiev washington attempted to recreate an intermarium from the baltic sea to the black sea and down to the eastern mediterranean  driving a permanent wedge between russia and germany
in order to facilitate the social transformation of europe into a america minor millions of pilgrims are necessary hence the deployment of coercive engineered migration as a tool to replace class conscious european workers with deracine youths  in some instances educated enough to do the lowpaid work assigned to them and acculturated enough to pose no problem to the powerelite
in the new trotskyite language of this imperial order any leader who attempts to stem the tide of globalisation through populist appeals to tradition and national identity is fascist fascist is a loaded term which generally connotes evil in the public mind in each european country there is a readymade army of youths from wealthy families whose job is to don hoddies attack police and scream fascist and racist at workingclass people desperately trying to find a way out of this nightmare these antifa are the modern equivalent to oswald mosleys fascist gangs in the s they represent the same class interests pettybourgeois leftism is the new world orders avantgarde
a favourite passtime of the antifa mob is throwing stones at police officers one can only gain acceptance in the antifascist gang by showing how much one hates the pigs so police officers from honest workingclass families get burned alive while the antifa mob chants slogans from the spanish civil war such violence is now a regular occurrence in demonstrations the agents provocateurs often receive help from the intelligence services french police are finding it hard to cope with the chaos developing all over french suburbs they complain that they are not sufficiently equipped and do not have the powers necessary to deal with the growing violence from delinquents they have been demonstrating in paris they have been calling for an end to the control of the french police by free masonry exacerbating the problem is the deepseated racism of many police officers who target black youths with spotchecksm  very often without reason
the recent demonstrations by french police in france against poor working conditions and low pay strongly suggests that there is the possibility that the rank and file of the french police could be waking up to the reality that france is government by a criminal gang after the magnanville terrorist attack in june where two police officers were killed a police officer at the funeral of the deceased refused to shake the hand of president hollande and prime minister manuel valls it was a highly significant act of insubordination
the police who in capitalist societies are the guardians of the ruling class are beginning to realise the criminality of the people they are protecting they are perhaps beginning to understand that the role of the state is to impose the dictatorship of one class over another  that of the minority of super wealthy over the labouring masses
many of these dissident police officers are linked to le pens national front a reliable source in french intelligence informed me that the secret services spend more time watching the farright than the socalled far left they see the far right as a real potential danger to the ruling order whereas the far left present no danger but are in fact a key component of ruling class ideology from the arab spring to nuit debout the farleft are the lifeblood of capitalism the potential of a major split between the national and compradore bourgeoise of imperial states for prospects of workingclass gains is something that needs more study
what should we make of all this in the context of ceta as i have said on numerous occasions the far right in france are and always have been political opportunists who exploit the despair of the masses they serve the interests of the national bourgeoisie but the national front are regularly denounced by the media not for being right wing rather they are dismissed as being closer to the far left the prospect of raising workers salaries nationalisation of key industries and a halt on the importation of cheap labour appeal to workingclass families
as i have pointed out before looking at a debate between the trotskyist jeanluc melanchon and marine le pen in  one would have thought that le pen was was the leftist and melanchon the rightwing militarist melanchon shamelessly defended the nato bombing campaign of libya while le pen opposed it
civil war on the horizon
the rightwing presidential candidate philippe de villiers has said there are plans afoot to divide the french territory between muslims and nonmuslims he quote s francois hollandes own writings to back up his claims everyone is talking about an imminent civil war in the bars and cafes of paris one can hear more and more disgruntled french citizens talking about media disinformation the demonisation of russia the homogenisation of thought and the criminality of the ruling class
the scene has never been more propitious to a populist take over of french politics but one should not have illusions about the national front they are following the menacious zionist narrative on the war on terror muslims are the problem the partys vicepresident forian philippot is close to the ultrazionist lawyer gilleswilliam goldnagel a friend of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu
philippot recently condemned the comments of presidential candidate jean frédéric poisson who said hillary clinton presented the greatest threat for the world as she is in the pay of the zionists poisson was subsequently forced to kneel before the representative council of jewish institutions in france crif where he sought forgiveness he was told he would be forgiven but they they would never forget in spite of the national fronts antimuslim bias an increasing number of muslims are voting for the party many muslims prefer the national front as they are sick and tired of being patronised and manipulated by the left  with their pseudo antiracism and humanitarian wars
there have also been major strikes by police in ireland for similar reasons to france french workers are losing everything and will soon become a lumpen proletariat meanwhile the french government has programmes in place to encourage migrants heading to britain to stay in france the socialist party is creating a new electorate it is a wise move for them because after the next election abstentionism will be the norm and the indigenous lumpen proletariat will resent the migrants the oligarchs will keep the masses in bondage through gmos takfiri antiislam and total reification of life ceta is the beginning of the end for social hope it is the prelude to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip  the most evil trade deal in history
french vicepresident of the trilateral commission herve de carmoy wrote a book in  entitled leuramerique  euramerica where he argues for the formation of what amounts to a transatlantic superstate run by a financial oligarchy ceta is the prelude to that project",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,7.981665512530776,126,20,8635,1401,5.1506067094932195,1401.0,1.9580495588739868,1.8648799738466224,1.4964709271827177,1.41836593545244,0.0606792896867627,1.4631241937607853,0.0028551034975017,0.0,0.0,0,3,0.0,0.0063818531663032,-0.9989,0.085,0.149,0.766,Negative,Very Strong

before the leaked tape of donald trump describing his propensity to grab women by the pussy to billy bush it seemed that the media was ignoring donald trumps glaring faults as a presidential candidate during the primaries  for example he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors it turns out there might be a reason for that  trump was bribing the media  at least thats the accusation being made by megyn kelly of fox news 
in her memoire settle for more which will be released this week kelly said that trump likely received the infamous question in which she asked about the fact that he has called women fat pigs dogs slobs and disgusting animals that question set trump off on one of his twitter tirades these are only a portion 
the worst and most controversial of which was this 
as the election progressed it became more and more apparent that trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior he expected no demanded that the media kiss his orange ass if they didnt he would cut off access but before that he tried bribery 
while kelly couldnt speak for other members of the media she alleges that trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels with full perks while the attempt clearly didnt work on kelly she says that with some their loyalty came cheap or perhaps not so cheap 
this is actually one of the untold stories of the  campaign i was not the only journalist to whom trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage kelly said he also attempted to woo them with praise she said adding this is smart because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking 
trump tried to work the refs and some of the refs responded she said 
when it became obvious that some reporters were in the tank for trump she alleges in one chapter certain tv hosts would work with the candidate in advance on occasional trump criticism so they would appear unbiased she didnt identify them by name or media outlet 
source yahoo 
kelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which kelly asked about trumps treatment of women the candidate called fox news exec bill sammon who told him about the first question all we heard about though during the election was that it was hillary clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering the insider knowledge said that a woman in the flint michigan debate would ask a question about the flint water  
while bribing journalists isnt illegal per say it is highly unethical without the fourth estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics democracy is impossible

gariac,tonopah test range google earth imagery,link hello again ats though we are two weeks out from election day as i sit to write these words  i find myself already looking beyond tuesday november the eighth and at some of the things that i think will happen between now and  as well as what i think the landscape will look like in the year leading up to that years election it wont be a popular opinion here on ats i am sure but as of today i feel confident in saying that short of some unprecedented and wholly unforseeable revelation or event  this years election is very likely a done deal hillary clinton will almost certainly be the next president of the united states with just two weeks remaining before election day  as of this writing  the metaanalysis of polls shows clinton possessing nearly an insurmountable lead while it is true that trump enjoys a very passionate and enthusiastic base he has done little to successfully expand that base the potential for him to find a means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters is minimal and shrinks with each passing day having come to this view i find myself free to look beyond the coming weeks and to try and get a handle on what a post  world will look like frankly gazing into my allegorical crystal ball i see dark and threatening clouds gathering on our horizon clouds that could very well bring a storm of epic proportions our way election night blues the night of tuesday november the eighth could well be historic  in the worst of ways this election cycle has broken several taboos and lowered the bar of political discourse in unprecedented ways it has been a season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric that has builtup a great deal of social tension we currently sit atop a very very dry powder keg of anger that is seething and highly volatile passions will be flaring among many as we watch the election results stream in on our televisions computers and phones many of those watching will be deeply deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race in this climactic moment we as a nation will be perilously close to critical mass one spark away from potential disaster four years ago a man with some degree of fame was emotionally invested in that years election and he took to social media twitter to vent his reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion that minor celebrity was one donald j trump source imagine for a moment what could happen if history repeats itself and this same man goes on a similar rant this election night imagine the violence such a display could potentially trigger then stop imagining and take a deep breath such a reaction is not just possible  given the evidence it is more than likely the probable outcome trump is currently heavily invested in telling his followers that the election is rigged that they have no voice and that he is the only one who can save them this is a very very dangerous and unstable bit of social chemistry most trump supporters obviously will not lash out in violence if their candidate loses the race  even if they personally feel that the outcome of the election was not legitimate however some trump supporters those in the extremes of what the media is currently calling the alt right very well could take to the streets in rage given some of the fringe support that trump enjoys i would honestly be surprised if such things were not already being planned by a handful of those on the fringe the rhetoric of revolution has been abused of late  and there are always the few who take such statements far too literally across the line blunty put  if election night comes and trump loses  and if he takes to twitter as he did four years ago  it could well result in a very long and bloody night a catastrophic night that we will look back upon with shame a night that could well poison our nation for years to come much ado about trump tv many pundits and wonks have mused over the fact that it truly does appear that trump has been laying the groundwork for a future media operation presumably a news network or service of some kind i count myself among those who have been suggesting so for a fairly long time however where i differ is that i dont see it as being quite so cut and dry any longer while i do think that trumps original thoughts  or more the thoughts of those who influence trump  was to create a new media conservative news venue i think that its now grown into something more i think that trump tv  or whatever they end up calling it  trump tv is too generic theres no inherent propaganda value in the name i think something more like trumps maga network is probably more on point  will be used as a device to begin a new political party more accurately to succeed where others have previously failed  im looking at you sarah palin and glenn beck  by congealing the various patriot tea party and fringe right wing groups into one collective and singular entity  a party firmly rooted in extreme nationalism with enough religion and conservatism thrown in to gain wider appeal my prediction is that donald trump will remain the focal point and figurehead of this coming movement  using this new network much as he currently utilizes his twitter feed a platform for him to vent his late night frustrations angers and insecurities his name will be predominantly used in the branding and messaging and trump will be the face of it all the most frequent speaker and guest imagine if the apprentice had been a  live streaming show  and trump had the power to walk in at any moment to say whatever happened to be on his mind that is how i see trump tv however i dont see trump being the driving force behind the actual message trump is a brand after all he has made his place in this world by putting his name on buildings he didnt build shows that he didnt create and ideas he didnt originate trump works as a spokesperson  the guy who says im not only the president of but im also a member the real people behind the curtain will be the mercers  robert and rebekah  steve bannon and to a lesser degree roger ailes as for on camera talents i think the current obvious potential faces of this new media enterprise will be hannity oreilly and lahren  though im honestly not personally sure if oreilly will make the jump money is money after all and big daddy bill is sitting pretty comfortably atop the fox news heap as his career winds down regardless however of who wins the backstage power war  other than the mercers who are a lock  and the on camera positions the network itself will be the propaganda arm of the extreme right wing and i think it very well could end up pulling the national discourse much further to the right in the coming  years particularly with the subjects of national isolationism and national identity

gop nominee donald trump who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him shot out a tweet thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines flipping to register votes for hillary clinton when voters choose trump 
a lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in texas trump tweeted 
people are not happy big lines what is going on a lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in texas people are not happy big lines what is going on 
 donald j trump realdonaldtrump october   
as infowars has highlighted  there have already been numerous reports of early voters in texas seeing their ballots flipped from donald trump to hillary clinton 
while election officials have dismissed the reports suggesting user error is to blame tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time 
larry norden a voting technology expert told npr that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed 
over time as people vote that calibration becomes less and less accurate norden noted 
during elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines flipping indeed the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as the simpsons drew attention to it 
meanwhile the washington post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering trumps rigged election claims 
callum borchers author at the washington post blog the fix writes since the final presidential debate last week many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to donald trump supporters your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election nov  a day later the timess upshot blog increased clintons chances of winning to  percent  an alltime high on monday politicos ben schreckinger wrote that  donald trumps path to an election night win is almost entirely closed  here at the fix chris cillizza and aaron blake wrote that  donald trumps chances of winning are approaching zero  these are accurate statistically sound statements but they are something else too declarations that trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the republican nominees warning that the rigged election could be  stolen from us  
the latest polls which trump insists are rigged due to oversampling show clinton with a double digit lead 
however hillary clintons campaign manager robby mook has warned that trumps suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are absolutely right 
weve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before election day mook said urging clinton supporters to vote

republicans cant get past the basic hurdle of needing actual evidence to back up their email conspiracy 
hillary clinton is facing donald trump in this election and only a moron or a truly desperate campaign manager clinging on the last bit of hope that she can find would believe that the reopening of an email investigation will make a bit of difference on election day

clinton can also be heard telling flowers how to handle a grievance filed by soemone else who applied for the same positioned and claimed she was more qualified than flowers 
flowers famously recorded a series of conversation she had with clinton from december  to december  while he was still governor of arkansas the audio segments about the state job were widely reported in the s however as other payforplay financial scandals have surfaced the details may warrant revisiting

Maia M,how correct breathing can prevent cancer and depression,"posted monday october   at pm edt 
low cholesterol and its consequence 

previously we have seen that cholesterol is a critical element of our cells and tissues  in addition scientific evidence suggests that high cholesterol is not necessarily harmful but offers a protective effect against brain disorders such as alzheimers disease  at this point we should ask the opposite question what about if we have too little cholesterol what are the consequences 

without cholesterol we would die 
it is well known today that cholesterol performs several important functions in the body one of the best important is not the most important function of cholesterol is to assist the proper regulation of the immune system indeed people who have a low blood cholesterol have an anergic immune system ie a lack of reaction by the bodys defense mechanisms to foreign substances vredevoe et al  in other words your body cannot fight off pathogens such as bacteria viruses parasites and fungi without cholesterol the different cells involved in an immune response such as macrophages lymphocytes etc cannot recognize the invaders and destroy them interestingly it was shown that the ldl particles are the ones needed for an adequate immune response masterjohn  these particles neutralize microbes and toxins before they cause any damage to the tissuesorgans and we call these ldl particles bad cholesterol without them we would be dead another fact is that a low blood cholesterol increases our risks of developing tuberculosis 
more importantly a sufficient supply of cholesterol to the immune system is critical to eliminate cancer cells indeed cholesterol is needed to slow down the progression of cancer in addition to cholesterol saturated fats like palmitic and myristic acids are also necessary for an optimum immune system these fats are found in tropical oil such as coconut oil would this fact explain why asian people have a lower rate of cancer than north americans 

is cholesterol protective not causative of heart disease 
there is a tremendous amount of evidence to suggest that microbial infections are one of the primary drive force of plaque accumulation in the arteries of the heart   in support of this a lack of buccal hygiene considerably increases your risk of heart disease  some researchers have noticed that people who suffered from a heart attack also had the flu a few days prior   it seems that those microorganisms change the structure of the blood vessels leading to inflammation and an accumulation of plaques at the sites of injury based on this evidence we can propose that cholesterol actually minimizes the risk of developing heart disease via the elimination of dangerous pathogens indeed it seems to be the case  
it is time to end this war on cholesterol science is very clear cholesterol does not cause heart disease on the contrary cholesterol is a vital element of a vibrant health by making sure the immune system is strong by being a critical component of vitamin d synthesis by helping the body make sex hormones among other functions",naturalnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,2.2264292892673696,55,8,3066,499,5.1002004008016035,499.0,-0.2127782344848829,-0.3899286096724409,0.0230712996352388,0.0043178628148932,0.0109332063876902,0.0160162318774921,0.0080160320641282,0.0,0.0060120240480961,0,1,0.0,0.0156097281143117,-0.9847,0.13,0.165,0.705,Negative,Very Strong

why do you think that free app on your phone that only performs a few functions swells in size with each update that is released do you really think they give a damn about your privacy and are plugging security holes hell no the apps we download are moving from useful lowresource using services to resource hogs necessitating an upgrade in processing power every year or two because they only provide us with a free service in order to hook us so the apps can gather information about everything weve ever written on our devices for social engineers and marketing flacks the apps are becoming more sophisticated in the way they monitor everything we do  which is why the apps need all that memory size
and soon apps will be gathering information about everything weve ever said aloud by using the built in microphones on each device and speech recognition technology cia agents confirm microphones can easily be activated even when a device is switched completely off
this type of information will be collected in giant databases such as the utah data center with the ultimate goal being the corporategovernment complex knowing more about us than we know about ourselves
big brother was so yesterday orwells big brother idea never could have imagined the insidious nature of todays information technology
todays information technology has put big brother on steroids
the waking times details this frightful world that is already emerging as anyone who pays attention knows search engines are already tailoring information to what we search for and even what we text people about
mr x weve studied the little virtual bubble you live in and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth
most of the time the information one will see in this internet bubble will be customized to suit a persons interests this is why facebook relentlessly pushes the like a page or product portion of its web site this information is used to build a profile of a person that ultimately will be able to accurately predict the color of their next bowel movement
if a man is interested in nongmo foods advertising and news stories will be tailored to inform him of grocers who sell organics and about news from approved outlets with stories written on the topic most of the time this will be insidious advertising and ads disguised as information
hello audience were going to pitch you on becoming fullfledged obsessed consumers as if there is no other worthy goal in lifeand then were going to profile you from top to bottom to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands
the utah data center is designed to store exabytes of information on all forms of communication including emails cell phone calls and internet searches as well as all types of personal data trailsparking receipts travel itineraries and bookstore purchases
as another example okay we know you are interested in traditional gender roles we  the information managers like facebook and google will now to find news stories and customize the information you get to read online in order to cause you to doubt the validity of your beliefs the ultimate goal is to slowly but steadily move you away from believing in traditional gender roles to believing in militant feminism without you realizing what we have done
this type of information management is even more insidious than outright censorship as it will be designed to steer everyone towards what the controllers of society want us to think and buy no matter how far from the ideal consumer and fellow traveler we may be
think of it as a game of plinko on the price is right in which all chips ultimately fall into the perfect braindead consumer slot at the bottom of the maze the social engineers dream is a world of nothing but sexless consumers who perform mindless work in meaningless jobs whose only outlets for pleasure are shopping and eating out and other stateapproved activities
think thats hyperbole travel around the world for six months to a year then come back to the united states and tell me what you think
little information bubbles merge into big information bubbles we become what we are repeatedly exposed to which is why a war is on for your mind
once we have you believing a certain way or questioning your established beliefs the key comes when it is time to steer public perception one way or the other this is where the rubber meets the road in the realm of managing the populace like so many sheeple
but when a big one comes along like the  national election in the us the separate tunes come together and ring as one then the overriding need to extend globalisms goals in the person of hillary clinton blot out every other priority then the major media twist whatever they need to twist then its the same bubble for everyone
soon just like the mainstream media on television and in print everything you see online will be directed at making you think behave and vote a certain way the micromanagement and control of information just hasnt become that sophisticated  yet
obama already hinted that only official information should be linked up by the corporate interests of facebook google etc look for hillary to implement that idea with an iron fist if she is whisked into the oval office  an internet security crisis will likely be engineered in the near future in whichyou guessed itbig daddy government needs to step in and take control of the web from there on out we will be back to corporategovernment propaganda instead of the libertarians dream the current iteration of the internet is
so the awakening we have seen from the brainwashing of the corporate media will be a temporary one if the elite have anything to do with it the groundwork of this new socialist system of micromanaging information is already being laid you already see it every time you do a search
someday soon the only information well be able to find online will be from sources the corporategovernment complex approves of of course there will be renegades and rebels like us who resist but most of the braindead sheeple out there will go along to get along just as has been happening since time immemorial
our options will be to get off the grid or to move to a new internet neither move will be peacefully tolerated by the powers that be

No Author,north carolina hillary supporter brags on facebook about voting multiple times,"the corruption of the clintons is like an endless dark pit of lies and manipulation 
i am so sick of clintons and i cant believe anyone would vote for her this fbi that is lying and trying to change documentation should be held to a legal standard and people who have tried to hide documentation and have lied should be thrown in prison for treason 
as far as how the media treats hillary clinton if youve noticed they treat her like a queen the liberal media likes to pamper lie and make sure america knows she is the best option we however know better so does jason chaffetz 
for those of you who do it know who chaffetz is he is the house committee on oversight and government reform chairman who famously told the guy who destroyed hillarys email server that he was served on live tv now he just served up a brutal threat to hillary clinton and she is running scared 
house committee on oversight and government reform chairman jason chaffetz confirmed it will hold additional hearings on democratic nominee hillary clintons private email server when members return from recess 
new fbi documents released monday show undersecretary of state patrick kennedy pushing the fbi to declassify emails in exchange for a quid pro quo deal  a move chaffetz and house permanent select committee on intelligence chairman devin nunes found deeply troubling 
undoubtedly there will be based on the documents the fbi released today there are new facts that need to be investigated im very concerned about the quid pro quo that was in negotiation between the state department and the fbi chaffetz told the daily caller news foundation chairman nunes and i believe patrick kennedy should be relieved of his duties immediately pending an investigation this is a manipulation if not an outright crime and so were gonna drive into that

EdJenner,california cafe wants legal fees paid by muslim women who sued them,"frank camp november   
during an interview with lesley stahl for  minutes  which will air in its entirety sunday night donald trump began to walk back his campaign promise regarding the deportation of illegal immigrants 
we are getting them out of our country the president elect said about the several million illegal immigrants with serious criminal records after the border is secure and after everything gets normalized were going to make a determination on the people youre talking about who are terrific people theyre terrific people who were going to make a determination on but before we make a determination we want to secure our border 
gasp 
donald trump rose to political fame on the back of his strong stance on illegal immigration throughout the primary process he promised a  deportation force  telling msnbcs mika brzezinski in november  
youre going to have a deportation force and youre going to do it humanely dont forget mika that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and theyre waiting to come in legally and i always say the wall were going to build the wall its going to be a real deal its going to be a real wall 
in august trump delivered a major immigration speech in phoenix arizona in which he softened his stance a bit focusing on illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes 
within ice i am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in america who have evaded justice 
he then added that anyone who has entered the united states illegally is subject to deportation that is what it means to have laws and to have a country otherwise we dont have a country 
during the final presidential debate between donald trump and hillary clinton trump reiterated his position against amnesty 
well first of all clinton wants to give amnesty which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many many years we need strong borders 
for trump diehards these statements were enough their guy was going to deport  million illegal immigrants and no one would tell them otherwise however as anyone with access to google should know the president elect has long supported amnesty in some fashion 
in july  donald trump told cnns dana bash 
i would get people out and then have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legala lot of these people are helping usand sometimes its jobs a citizen of the united states doesnt want to do i want to move em out and were going to move em back in and let them be legal 
what trump was talking about is known as touchback amnesty such a plan would indeed involve the deportation of illegal immigrants but allow them an expedited means of returning to the united states in order to obtain legal status in other words they touch base in their home country then come right back 
in november  eric trump repeated his fathers plan during an interview with fox news megyn kelly 
the point isnt just deporting them its deporting them and letting them back in legally hes been so clear about that and i know the liberal media wants to misconstrue it but its deporting them and letting them back legally 
going back further trumps support for amnesty is even more stark speaking on fox  friends in  he said 
for people that have been here for years that have been hardworkers have good jobs theyre supporting their familyits very very tough to just say by the way  years you have to leave get outim one of the worlds very conservative people but i have to tell you on a human basis how do you throw somebody out thats lived in this country for twenty years 
during the  presidential election cycle trump even called mitt romneys idea of selfdeportation  maniacal  and remarked that republican party policy toward illegal immigrants was  meanspirited  
donald trump is a man who will say whatever he needs to in order to win now that he has won hes already backtracking on multiple campaign promises from the repeal of the affordable care act aca to the deportation of illegal immigrants tags",dailywire.com,Real,english,99.09687615386632,93.82490884357614,67,12,4150,722,4.696675900277008,722.0,0.154122237632109,0.3616742515005802,0.3098669893930889,0.3539106789991204,-0.3873059017192671,0.3737823909683728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9937,0.154,0.085,0.761,Positive,Very Strong
Brutus Centinel,the importance of patriarchal religion to marriage and childrearing,"suppose you are one of those adventurous americans who meets and marries a beautiful foreign woman you are the envy of all your friends what next
you can bring her back home to the united states or europe the guys will be jealous the women will feel threatened and your bride will be a fish out of waterfor a while but it doesnt take them long to get established she will find a group of her countrywomen other thais vietnamese or ukrainians they will teach her the ropes where to go shopping for the kind of groceries she needs the most efficient way to send money to her relatives back home where her fellow countrymen hang out and oh yes they will also learn american culture their friends will explain about american men and american divorce law and that is where the trouble starts
my vietnamese war bride an upscale frenchified thing informed me after just over a year of marriage after i had helped her family escape saigon that a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle when the inevitable the divorce came she refused a reasonable settlement offer and hired a junkyard dog lawyer to fight it in court losing she was shocked to discover that that offer was off the table
keep your woman in her own country where she is comfortable and where the culture is more likely to appreciate men you make the adjustment to her culture instead of vice versa why american culture is about the most poisonous in the world almost anything is better countries that havent been indoctrinated in feminism and cultural marxism still value children and respect a womans role in bearing them and raising them they also respect a mans role as the breadwinner and head of the family
i committed myself to ukraine nine years ago met my wife seven years ago and our son appeared five years ago it is worth enumerating the many ways in which it is a pleasure to be living with her and raising him in kyiv instead of the usa
 kyiv is a beautiful and lively city beautiful architecture  andreevska church
kyiv is a worthy capital city it has millenniumlong history studded with cathedrals and other exquisitely crafted monuments there are many many targets for a tourist camera the walled city was built to be defensible situated atop a steep bluff on the right bank of the dnieper river close to where the desno river joins from the east  miles south of where another major tributary the pripyat flows in from the west from their capital in kyiv the viking princes could easily sally out in their long boats to the black sea or anywhere in western russia
the sandy river beaches are good for swimming from june to september and for fishing any time it isnt frozen one can rent kayaks and rowboats or take a river cruise in the warmer months when it does freeze it is dotted with ice fishermen all it takes is a saw some bait a line and the antifreeze of ones choice there are bicycle paths along the river and on the islands in the middle of the river the city is experiencing a surge in the number of bicycle commuters
the soviet system had its good points they housed everybody in highrise apartments it may not be as attractive as detached houses but it makes for a very compact city those people needed places to breathe and exercise so the city is full of parks as compact as kyiv is it is with most people living in apartment blocks it easy to get around every place in the city is within walking distance of a convenience store of some sort and restaurants and shopping centers are usually within a walk or a short bus ride
young people the world over want to live in the city and kyiv is no exception it has lots of bars cafés and nightclubs the trends are toward sushi and italian food ukraine is traditional enough that young people even go to church there are orthodox churches in every neighborhood and a handful of englishspeaking congregations scattered throughout the city
kyiv is home to ukraines most famous universities shevchenko university kyivmohyla academy and kyiv polytechnic institute these are their harvard yale and mit  an extraordinarily high percentage of business and government leaders have graduated from them they know each other as in the united states just being admitted to these universities is a sign of intelligence and talent for a foreigner getting to know these elites is a lot easier than getting to know ivy leaguers in the united states
 ukraine is extremely affordable attractive inexpensive traditional markets and supermarkets of course
kyiv is a very inexpensive place to live very bottom of the big mac index the hryvnya exchange rate has fallen threefold since the start of the war in donbass prices have risen especially for imports but not nearly as much the tourist will note that it is still possible to get a decent hotel room for  a taxi anywhere in the city for  and a meal for under  that is just the start
for those of us who live here  metro ridesbuses and trams are even lessmake life cheap and convenient try the grocery store a pound for potatoes beets carrots onions and cabbage the staples of the ukrainian diet meat is generally under two dollars a pound although there is a lot of hue and cry about corruption in the energy business in the end it costs far less than in the united states  a month to heat a house and between four and five dollars a gallon for gasoline however most ukrainians utilities are included in rent and only a few drive cars
medical care is a preview of the impending obamacare disaster the state promises the moon but delivers only what it can afford the average ukrainian has to stand in a long line to get indifferent service from underequipped and underpaid doctors in shabby soviet era hospitals the flip side is that feeforservice is alive and well you can get decent care if you pay for it and it doesnt cost very much in fact ukraine is a medical tourism destination especially for fertility treatments plastic surgery and dental work
an american social security check makes you rich by local standards it is a good place to live in retirement moreover any american can teach english and there are a number of entrepreneurial opportunities that dont take a lot of capital to start
 ukrainians are fairly uniformly slavic  and they like people like themselves just us slavs
western newspapers are full of horror stories about ukraine  war and corruption leaders in moscow washington and europe love to point fingers at us to distract from the increasingly blatant corruption surrounding those in the west im no fan of corruption but given the fact that it is universal it is worth relating why ukrainian corruption is more comfortable to live with than that of the europe or the united states
there is no hypocrisy about our corruption or rather the hypocrisy is so transparent that nobody believes the lies the virtue we still have free speech ukrainians do not lose their jobs if they are politically incorrect they are not jailed if they say what they think about middle eastern immigration if you tell a woman she looks good she might actually blush and appreciate it
the corruption has kept the standard of living low which perversely has important benefits people remain traditional because they have needed the support of families just to survive asylum seeking immigrants dont come because there is nothing here for themfew jobs and nothing in the way of welfare
not having immigrants leads to high levels of social capital the people actually like and trust each other i am the only american in our little development of  homes they have included me in the groupeverybody knows me and says hello when i meet them on the street in the bus and in the stores in my toney neighborhood of bethesda maryland most neighbors were too occupied with their important jobs to bother being neighborly
the fact that it is mostly just slavs has a couple of important corollaries there are no bad neighborhoods in kyiv people will tell you to avoid the troyeshchena but a lot of people i know live there i went to see for myself i had a couple of pleasant shots of vodka chatting with the locals i cannot imagine doing that in the anacostia neighborhood of washington dc
people always stand up to give my son and me a seat on the bus or metro old ladies absolutely gush over him and engage him in small talk they support their rising generation and are tickled to death that i am raising him to be a ukrainian
lastly even though the locals will tell you otherwise ukrainians are good and polite drivers they invariably stop for you at crosswalks very few will drive after even one drink fatalities per vehicle mile are about twice as high as in the west because the roads are poor but you cant blame it on the drivers
 young people have pride in themselves an english language toastmasters meeting
students and young professionals show selfrestraint no tattoos no piercings no sloppy clothes no swearing very little smoking and no drugs they are what in the s was called squaredelightfully so they look forward to marriage and families especially the women for this reason they are perhaps not as easy as girls elsewhere but when you get one you have something of substance
there are lots of places to meet young people needless to say bars and nightclubs there are studios all over town giving inexpensive dance lessonssalsa and swing are bigand hundreds of sports clubs the english language mafia club is thriving the toastmasters public speaking club attracts many of the best and brightest with meetings in english german russian and ukrainian the language exchange club also meets in several languages from may to september the river beaches are great surrounded by restaurants bars and discos
ukrainians love to practice their english and welcome foreigners not too many make it this far east it is an easy place to make friends
 it is a good place to sit out the wests coming civil unrest one of kyivs many lovely river beaches
the western press would have you believe that kyiv is a lawless wild west that is the opposite from the truth  even today it is safer than any western capital city
the first danger cited is vladimir putin when are the russians going to invade answer they wont throughout is history russia has expanded by stealth and opportunity they stopped when finland fought back in  and georgia fought back in  they swiped the baltics and part of poland only after germany had started a war that diverted the worlds attention they imposed their will on their european satellites only because the red army conveniently occupied them at the end of world war ii
in ukraine they took the opportunity of political chaos in  to steal crimea where by treaty they already had a large military presence emboldened they thought they had an opportunity in the russianspeaking donbass but the ukrainians resisted and that war is at a standstill putin knows full well that  million ethnic russians cannot dominate  million ethnic ukrainians especially under the glare of world opinion despite what the neocons may have shouted to sway the us election the russians are not coming another comforting thought is that there is nothing here worth nuking it is a benefit of staying out of nato
there is no dependent class here to rise up when economic hardship hits hardship is already here there are no discontented minorities gypsies the most visible of them actually workthey sell flowers and work as junk dealers you cannot be a parasite if there is no blood to suck it is the united states and europe that have legions of restless unemployed who are only being pacified by government benefits and will rise up when governments can no longer afford them
ukraines corruption is well understood by everybody as much as they complain people know how to cope with it it may take bribery to get things done but they generally do get done corruption does not result in much violence occasionally some hardnosed judge or a pesky reporter gets bumped off true but in every case the victim could have explained quite clearly why he was targeted it is not like the random killing of whites by blacks in the united states or random islamic terror in western europe

the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint against representative jason chaffetz on monday morning with the office of congressional ethics for his role in releasing information provided to him by fbi director james comey 
representative chaffetz in an illplanned partisan attempt released information that compromised the integrity of the fbi when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating secretary clintons emails had been reopened when in fact it had not been members of congress are elected to make our country a safer better place not to use their power to work with leaders such as comey in a partisan fashion i hope that both are held accountable for their actions said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump 
director comey is already facing a complaint that was filed with department of justic e accusing him of violating the hatch act by using his position as a federal employee to influence the outcome of an election 
the comey letter couldnt have gone much worse for republicans what the gop originally hoped was an election shifting moment had become a republican scandal that democrats are strongly suggesting will inspiring hearings if they win back the senate majority  
thanks to chaffetz house republicans have already their credibility for future clinton investigations a s the utah republicans spin of comeys letter was debunked in a matter of hours

Claire Bernish,brother of clintons campaign chair is an active foreign agent on the saudi arabian payroll,"posted on october   by isaac davis 
the months long dakota access keystone xl pipleine protest at the standing rock indian reservation by native americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavyhanded and brutal clamp down by police and national guard militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with lrad sonic weapons attack dogs  tear gas tazers  and even live ammunition  killing horses  while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up 
but as the saying goes water is life  and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement therefore for people concerned with life giving up on this is simply unthinkable the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism and the perception that money is more important than life itself when the police and national guard attack us citizens on private property to protect corporate interests who are they really working for 
the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren ceo of energy transfer partners the company responsible for the project 
so who is kelcy warren 
a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering warren worked in the natural gas industry and became cochair of energy transfer equity in  with business partner ray davis coowner of the texas rangers baseball team warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nations largest pipeline companies which now owns about  miles of pipelines carrying natural gas natural gas liquids refined products and crude oil the companys holdings include sunoco southern union and regency energy partners 
forbes estimates the yearold warrens personal wealth at  billion bloomberg described him as among americas new shale tycoons  but rather than building a fortune by drilling he takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another chilling boiling pressurizing and processing it until its worth more than when it burst from the wellhead  source  
shockingly in  the governor of texas greg abbott appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another  million pipeline project  
according to the governors office the state parks and wildlife commission manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas along with ensuring the future of hunting fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans  source  
this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post his petition is described here  
most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline the dallasbased billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fasttracking a  mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation no environmental impact assessment no respect for cultural sites and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river a similar story is unfolding out in west texas where warrens company has split through the pristine big bend region with the  mile comanche trail pipeline and nearlycomplete  mile trans pecos pipeline these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region 
with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a  year term as  of the  commissioners who preside over texas parks and wildlife why probably the  in campaign contributions abbott received from warren 
footage of militarized police using the long range acoustic device  lrad  crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on october th  final thoughts 
warren is listed as number  on forbes list of wealthiest americans with an estimated net worth of  billion in september of  he is the head of the dakota access pipeline snake 
if you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating gassing and attacking peaceful resistors  including women children and the elderly the answer is they are doing it to protect the interests of kelcy warren and others invested in this pipeline project read more articles by isaac davis

How To Kill Zombie Arguments,comment on brilliant takedown of feminism from an old man by how to kill zombie arguments,"submit home this month popular  reasons why you should try photography as a hobby  reasons why you should try photography as a hobby photography really is one of the most rewarding hobbies a man could pursue ness nomadison 
ness is a thirtysomething american with almost a decade of experience living and traveling across asia hes a strong believer in pursuing ones passions continual selfimprovement and just being the best man he can be he runs his own website nessthenomadcom  november   lifestyle 
have you ever had a curiosity in photography yet you werent sure if its a hobby really worthy of your limited time then this article was written for you as i was also once in your shoes 
i picked up a dslr camera for the first time back in  which awoke a passion inside me that i never even knew was there three and half years later im here to tell you just a few of the many benefits and realizations ive experienced by taking on this timeless hobby here are eight reasons photography might just be the most meaningful hobby youve overlooked your entire life  an opportunity to flex your creative muscle 
in order to be balanced human beings i believe people need to be physically healthy spiritually awake and creatively expressive photography just like writing and film is a selfless way to be creative while also giving something back to the world 
the way we interpret our world changes from individual to individual and photography provides a medium for people to express themselves ask ten different photographers to photograph the same thing  a city for example  and be prepared to see ten wildly different visions of the same subject in our sensoryoverload world it feels good to create something thats uniquely you  appreciate and understand your surroundings more 
i now find myself seeing everything around me in rectangular framesa takeaway from having to frame so many pictures over the years oh those people over there would fit perfectly into a  box or that building over there would look perfect boxed in from this angle my eyes are now sharper than ever 
but i also find myself observing and appreciating all the little things around me i always have to keep my camera nearby because i often want to photograph something ive noticed in my daily routine the pattern on a sewer lid a reflection in a puddle birds perched in a tree and so forth 
my prephotographer self just like most of the rest of the world would have walked right past these things without a care in the world yet now i can be entertained from the most minuscule and simple things especially if my camera is handy the world is full of photogenic things if can just teach yourself to notice them  help preserve history 
since its inception photography has always been one of the most moving ways to preserve history in our rapidly changing modern times photos touch people in a way other media cant both photography and video are both visual arts but photographs differ in that they capture merely one frame of what is going on yet one frame is all one needs to feel taken back to another time 
with the advent of the smartphone photography is as accessible as ever while this sounds good on paper the truth is our worlds becoming more and more flooded with garbage and narcissistic photographs our world needs more adventurous and welltrained photographers out there taking photos of the modern world we live in and the rapid changes its undergoing these are the photos that will be cherished decades down the road not all the shitty selfies that bog down social media  travel experiences will be more meaningful 
photography goes with traveling like bread goes with butter it took me nearly five years of traveling internationally to finally get serious about doing photography on my trips and after i got started i never looked back 
rather than traveling for escapism and hedonism im traveling to learn about and document our world as a result my trips feel much more meaningful and fulfilling than they ever did before the way you see and come to understand a country as a photographer is quite different than if you werent one 
i now divide my history of travel experiences into two separate groupsthe trips i had before i owned a dslr camera and the trips i had after buying one photography is so fun and addicting that i find myself wanting to go back to all those predslr camera destinations even the ones i didnt enjoy all that much just so i can reexperience them with a camera in hand  an opportunity to meet new people 
one thing i always try to do when i travel is meet fellow photographers whether they be foreign or local i appreciate talking to people with an observational eye as they can provide me with unique insight that nonphotographers rarely can 
but photography doesnt just help you meet other photographers it helps you meet other people from all walks of life ive had regular people on the street come up and talk to me once they saw i was taking photos ive also met people from online for no other reason than they liked my work 
being a good photographer can also be a great way to meet women theyre not gonna start blowing you as soon as they see your awesome pictures but dont be surprised if you discover some newfound female admiration once your excellent photography skills are out in the open and if you can make a woman look beautiful in a photo shell admire you in a way you never imagined  a blog with an edge 
in the diverse world of independently run blogs how many bloggers do you know who can both write well and photograph well i can literally only think of one  and the fact that this blogger is just as good at utilizing a camera as he is at wielding a pen or rather a keyboard puts his website in a league of its own in terms of quality content 
though i still highly respect the good bloggers out there for their amazing writing skills and insights i think theyre doing both their readers and websites a great disservice by merely using stock photos or shitty shotwithacellphone photos in their articles 
readers can definitely tell the difference when a blogger takes all of their own photos with a nice dslr camera start taking nice dslrshot photos and see for yourself how they can enhance your articles theyll give you just that much more of an edge over all the other bloggers who dont  youll also have an edge over  of others on social media and dating sites 
since everyone else is posting lame smartphonetaken shots all over their social media accounts your dslrshot photos could shine like diamonds in the rough the same way you stand above  of other men by lifting weights regularly the same advantage can be expected by not taking cheap shortcuts with your social mediabound photography your facebook instagram and twitter accounts will all look better than ever before 
this is also true for dating websites and apps where most chumps just take some lame mirror selfies with their smartphone and then upload them to their accounts dudes with welltaken nontraditional photos stand out big time dont just take my word for it as there has actually been plenty of discussion about these benefits over at the roosh v forum  
and although they can be very helpful you dont actually need another photographer with you to get some good shots of yourself rather all you need is your camera an autofocus lens a tripod a remote shutter and a creative eye  a resumeenhancing marketable skill 
photography isnt just mentally rewarding it can also be financially rewarding if you play your cards right the field of profitable photography may be vast and highly competitive but one things for sure  the demand for new photographs is infinite the world never stops turning after all stock portrait wedding wildlife travel sports and news photography are just a few of the most in demand and profitable niches 
but if you really wanna make money selling your photographs you gotta make a name for yourself by sharpening your skills and networking with the right people a great photographer who no one knows exists wont make any money 
my father is an outdoorsman slash wildlife photographer with decades of experience tens of thousands of photos and a giant network of contacts from his industry it seems like magazine and website editors are always knocking on his door because they know he probably has a nice shot of exactly what theyre looking for often all he has to do is dig through his archives and boomhes made  bucks conclusion 
stop dreaming about it and just give photography a shot already borrow your friend or a family members dslr camera for the weekend and just get out there and take pictures of anything that strikes your fancy 
photography takes decades to master but it all begins with a single click of the shutter button yet sometimes all it takes is one little click to realize youve been missing out on something very big and meaningful your entire life youll never know until you try",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,82.22642928926737,89,16,8938,1567,4.672622846202936,1567.0,0.8267731031799278,1.1132771126736014,1.576636143046766,1.6786009466030305,-0.411043907191684,1.7294433973889745,0.0012763241863433,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.00192734709712,0.9997,0.159,0.026,0.815,Positive,Very Strong
