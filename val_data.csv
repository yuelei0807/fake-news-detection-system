system since november th the dow has hit a brand new alltime record high the us dollar has strengthened greatly and bank stocks are way up but not all of the economic news is good news unlike stocks bonds have reacted very negatively to trumps election victory the past week has been an absolute bloodbath for bond traders and as you will see below this is going to have dramatic implications for all us consumers moving forward over just a two day period more than a trillion dollars was wiped out as bond yields spiked all over the globe as cnn has noted this type of violent reaction in the bond market has only happened three other times within the past ten years the rate on year treasury notes has surged to from before the election last weeks spike in treasury rates was so big that it had only happened three times before in the last decade blackrocks russ koesterich called it a violent reaction the move stands to have broad repercussions for all americans not only will the us government have to pay more to borrow money but mortgage rates and car loan costs should also rise thats because treasuries are used as the benchmark for many other forms of credit as interest rates rise virtually everyone in our society is going to feel the pain those that need an auto loan in order to purchase a vehicle are going to find that loan payments are significantly higher than they were before credit card rates will also go up and those just getting out of school will discover that their student loan payments are even more suffocating but the biggest impact will be felt in the housing market the average rate on a year fixed mortgage just hit the psychologicallyimportant percent barrier and that could mean big trouble for the housing market in the average contract rate on the popular year fixed mortgage hit percent according to mortgage news daily a level most didnt expect to see until the middle of next year rates have now moved nearly a half a percentage point higher since donald trump was elected president the situation on the ground is panicked damage control said matthew graham chief operating officer of mortgage news daily people were trying to lock loans quickly last week and are now facing a tough choice to lock today or hope for a bounce many hoped for a bounce last week heading into the long weekend and we obviously didnt get it rising interest rates was one of the key factors that precipitated the financial crisis of and many fear that it could happen again and without a doubt this rise in rates is going to affect the affordability of homes that are already on the market if youre going to buy a house and your mortgage payment went up by or you may buy a smaller house theres impact on interest rate sensitive sectors like autos and housing and also corporate bonds themselves where financial engineering has helped juice up the equity market said george goncalves head of rate strategy at nomura in addition rising rates will make it more difficult for those with adjustable rate mortgages to keep their homes foreclosure activity was already up percent during the month of october and many are projecting that we could see another giant spike in foreclosures during the months ahead that is similar to what we saw during the last financial crisis many trump supporters dont really care what the rest of the world thinks of our new president but this is an area where what the rest of the world thinks really really matters the truth is that the rest of the planet is not all too fond of trump and if that makes them a lot less eager to lend us money that is a major problem the only way that we can maintain our massively inflated debtfueled standard of living is to continue to borrow gigantic mountains of money from the rest of the world at ultralow interest rates if the rest of the world starts demanding higher rates of return now that trump is president we are going to experience economic pain on a scale that most americans dont believe is possible one of our big lenders has been china and right now they are deeply a trump presidency might mean trump has talked very tough about trade with china and the chinese are gearing up for a major trade war the following comes from cnbc during his election campaign this year trump spoke of a percent import tariff on all chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work should any such policy come into effect china will take a titfortat approach according to an opinion piece in the global times a newspaper backed by the communist party a batch of boeing orders will be replaced by airbus us auto and iphone sales in china will suffer a setback and us soybean and maize imports will be halted china can also limit the number of chinese students studying in the us the global times article read most trump supporters assume that since trump has been a very successful businessman that he will be able to strengthen the us economy but it isnt that simple the only reason we are able to live the way that we live today is because we have been able to borrow trillions upon trillions of dollars at irrationally low interest rates the moment the rest of the world decides that they are not going to loan us money at irrationally low interest rates any longer the game is over and it wont really matter who is in the white house at that point so watch interest rates very carefully if they keep going up it is inevitable that a major economic slowdown will follow no matter what economic policies the new trump administration implements november th

have to take some pain eat less work out same goes with making our economy work for americans we are going to need to take some pain to be able to improve the economy and make it work for every american and not just the top the rates had to go up they couldnt really go down anymore and its going to have some negative impacts but those impacts are due to living beyond our means and making bad choices now we will need to pay for that a bit lack of lending from others will require us to produce at all and thats a good thing producing at home will lead to more jobs and make us less depend on others less then the final major truth about the world economy is and you have detailed many times is that the worlds debt is far in excess of what can be payed its time for write downs and admit this

sheriffs department said that people had been arrested and that at least one bullet had been fired from the frontlines officers met violence and resistance including a protester who fired a gun at officers in the police line protesters who threw molotov cocktails at them and set vehicles and debris on fire the sheriffs office said in a post on facebook an ap news story cites state spokesperson

continued construction and the numerous violations of civil and human rights we have repeatedly seen a disproportionate response from law enforcement to water protectors nonviolent exercise of their constitutional rights he said in a statement today we have witnessed people praying in peace yet attacked with pepper spray rubber bullets sound and concussion cannons we urge state and federal government agencies to give this tense situation their immediate and close attention he noted that dapl parent company energy transfer partners had completely ignored the request by the administration of president barack obama to voluntarily halt construction while the legal issues raised by the tribe were resolved by deploying law enforcement to support dapl construction the state of north dakota is collaborating with energy transfer partners and escalating tensions archambault said we need our state and federal governments to bring justice and peace to our lands not the force of armored vehicles archambault urged everyone who supports standing rocks efforts to divert or halt the pipeline to remain peaceful and prayerful and not resort to violence or lash out in anger any act of violence hurts our cause and is not welcome here he said we invite all supporters to join us in prayer that ultimately the right decisionthe moral decisionis made to protect our people our sacred

penchant for saying things that are mindbogglingly asinine apparently yglesias agrees with this sentiment matt yglesias deleted something like tweets yesterday clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations fortunately the internet is forever and all of the stupid things that yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly here are things yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb yglesias was convinced that people would love obamacare that is until he didnt mattyglesias obamacare marker which was solid as of minutes ago appears to no longer be markering pictwittercomaeyximig omri ceren cerenomri october his piece is still available though and in it he whines about how supposedly the media for nonideological reasons is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that when obamacare becomes the status quo people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten in other words yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking that all fell by the wayside when the obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of percent yglesias made a racist comment toward former louisiana gov bobby jindal r in a tweet that is now deleted yglesias wrote is bobby jindals reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping yglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash tweeting oh fun conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode eventually yglesias backed down tweeting for the record now that i know more about jindals life its clear that hes a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff the irony of yglesias saying this was not lost on twitter good thing you dont say dumb stuff mt mattyglesias its clear that jindals a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff jon gabriel exjon june yglesias once ranted against dumb jewish politicians the leftist pundit wrote a thinkprogress piece in that was seriously titled dumb jewish politicians in which yglesias highlighted a passage from jonathan chait who wrote in the new republic that thensen joe lieberman ict had to be stupid for not supporting the public option i suspect that lieberman is the beneficiary or possibly the victim of a cultural stereotype that jews are smart and good with numbers chait wrote trust me its not true if senator smith from idaho was angering democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes most liberals would deride him as an idiot with lieberman we all suspect its part of a plan i think he just has no idea what hes talking about and doesnt care to learn yglesias agreed ive long held a related theory about eric cantor anyways this reminds me that at a meeting this morning i pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret christmas morning session that only jewish senators would attend theres a whole bunch boxer cardin feingold feinstein franken kohl lautenberg levin lieberman sanders schumer specter and wyden its a very progressive bunch and lieberman could easily be outvoted yglesias advocated for ending time zones seriously in what was a typical example of vox being a waste of space yglesias wrote a piece titled the case against time zones theyre impractical outdated yglesias pontificated northern idaho is connected via i to spokane and seattle to its west but not to boise to its south so the couer dalene area is on pacific time rather than mountain time india has broken with the general scheme and adopted a halfhour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time yet while these zigzags and minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time they serve a very practical purpose it is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings calls and other arrangements across time zones the need to constantly specify which time zone youre talking about is a drag commuting across time zones would be more annoying still which is why the suburbs of chicago that are located in indiana use illinois central time rather than indianapolis eastern time but the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations its to shift the world to one giant time zone ygleasias then called for one time to rule them alla phrase that prompted jrr tolkien to weep in his graveand then wrote this doozy if the whole world used a single gmtbased time schedules would still vary in general most people would sleep when its dark out and work when its light out so at most of london would be at home or in bed and most of los angeles would be at the office but of course londons bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in la would be grabbing a nap the difference from today is that if you were putting together a londonla conference call at thered be only one possible interpretation of the proposal a flight that leaves new york at and lands in paris at is a sixhour flight with no need to keep track of time zones if your appointment is in el paso at you dont need to remember that its in a different time zone than the rest of texas pejman yousefzadeh explained just how stupid yglesiass time zone piece was writing at ricochet i grant you that there are times when confusion does take place but seriously who cares is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that matthew yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them dont the people at vox have anything better to write about apparently they dont yglesias doesnt understand floridas geography very well yglesias wrote a short blurb in the atlantic in in which he began thinking aloud about the city of miami id been interested to know what if anything is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know yglesias said people immediately pointed the obvious answer miami couldnt do so because there was this thing called a swampmost of which is the everglades national parkcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish yes yes commenters i know its a freaking swamp but theres plenty of development on exswampland in florida hence all the canals and weirdlooking lakes an exasperated yglesias wrote in an update except that the land is not exswampland its an actual swamp maybe yglesias shouldnt write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fineif youre a politician yglesias found himself getting smacked around on twitter after he advocated for highspeed rail advocates to provide an unrealistically optimistic projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government for better or for worse thats politics yglesias wrote at thinkprogress on twitter yglesias attempted to justify it by writing fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do yes and yet yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist eli lake of being dishonest on twitter yglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a catch when he told the daily caller to go f yourself when they tried to interview him about the twitter incident yglesias once hailed the department of veteran affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate the federalist s sean davis pointed to yglesias writing in that the va was producing the highest quality care in the country their turnaround points the way toward solving americas healthcare crisis yglesias also tweeted at gop chairman reince priebus in will reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans this tweet was also deleted and for good reason since the va has caused veteran deaths due to systemic problems with the agency yglesias doesnt understand the purpose of the senate yglesias wrote the following for thinkprogress in per the guardian if you add together the two republican senators from wyoming with the one from alaska one from south dakota one from new hampshire two from maine two from idaho two from nebraska one from nevada two from utah two from kansas two from mississippi one from iowa two from oklahoma two from kentucky one from louisiana two from south carolina and two from alabama the of them collectively represent on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator percent of the american population meanwhile barbara boxer and dianne feinstein together represent percent of the american population now of course texas is also a big state though at percent of the population its a lot smaller than california and there are small states like vermont and north dakota that have two democratic senators so the point here isnt a narrowly partisan one though the wacky apportionment of the senate does have a partisan valence the point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things if you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population we have just senators representing the aboveaverage states even though they collectively contain percent of the population the other senators represent about percent of the people if the iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them in three paragraphs of rambling incoherent nonsense yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations yglesias doesnt understand americas financial system yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a slate column that there were far far far too many banks in the country as there were at the time yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous they are poorly managed you know how the best and brightest of wall street royally screw up sometimes this doesnt get better when you drill down to the lessbright and notasgood guys it gets worse and since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from fdicensured depositors nobody is watching the store in effect the wellmanaged banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones the dubious decisionmaking doesnt get as complicated as what you see on wall streetits mostly just classic boomandbust procyclical commercial real estate loansbut it creates all the same problems they cant be regulated since these banks are so small they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs so since american public policy is perversely committed to preserving them small banks regularly get various kinds of carveouts from regulations and once the carveouts exist they create pressure for extension further up the food chain other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation they cant compete if you want the jpmorgan chases and bank of americas of the world to be held to account you need both regulation and competition but a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesnt offer any real competition having a large share of americas banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize bigtime finance davis debunked yglesiass argument which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there havent been any new banks formed in recent years there were at least four in yglesias arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anticommunity bank talking points promoted by the big banks you guys the wall street banks that nearly destroyed america arent the problem small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem dont worry about the facts just go with it davis wrote in the federalist im actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon after reading a review of a booker t washington biography yglesias started thinking about black conservative political tradition prompting him to write in a thinkprogress post its only extremely recently that the idea of an africanamerican aligning himself à la clarence thomas with the mainstream conservative movement in america could be remotely possible but even so that didnt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didnt exist this is patently false as damon root explained in reason actually the great harlem renaissance author and journalist george schuylerwho was known as the black hl menckenpublished general rightist sentiments long before clarence thomas came on the scene including schuylers unambiguously titled autobiography black and conservative and the celebrated novelist and folklorist zora neale hurston both endorsed conservative sen robert a taft in the presidential election and repeatedly attacked fdrs new deal yglesias expressed joy when andrew breitbart died following breitbarts death yglesias tweeted conventions around dead people are ridiculous the world outlook is slightly improved with andrewbrietbart sic dead this tweet has also been deleted and for good reasoncelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid its ghoulish vile and reprehensible and slate defended yglesias stating that he is a very passionate journalist and slate values that passion apparently slate believes that passion trumps basic human decency and a reasonable iq level and yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities,1

when cops arrived and killed them both matt agorist february comments inglewood ca on sunday police responded to a call of a suspicious vehicle parked on manchester boulevard around am when police arrived they engaged in a minute long standoff before opening fire on the man and woman inside the vehicle killing them both in the news release on monday following the shooting police claimed that the woman in the car had a gun scott collins a spokesman for the inglewood police department said that the couple refused to obey the officers commands to exit the vehicle the officers then feared for their safety and opened fire on the car killing the couple the woman was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting and the man succumbed to his injuries after paramedics transported him to a local hospital according to the la times the shooting seemed like an open and shut case until the next day mayor james butts while responding to questions about the shooting opened up a huge can of worms both the man and the woman were unconscious for at least minutes police attempted to rouse them in an effort to deescalate the situation said butts after admitting that the couple was asleep butts quickly defended the officers noting obviously at some point they were conscious because somebody felt threatened however that notion has yet to be proven and is particularly unlikely due to the fact that not a single officer received so much as a scratch nor did the couple have any reason to be violent both of the victims were parents kisha michael a single mother of three sons and marquintan sandlin a single father of four daughters michaels twin sister trisha stated the obvious when she said that its possible that kisha merely passed out on the way home from their night out families for both described them as devoted parents who made arrangements for care of their children while they took a night off according to nbc los angeles the police aint telling us nothing said trisha michael after being met with tight lips from the department he was a loving father said sandlins sister leandra faulkner all he cared about was his girls getting them right of course as is standard procedure for all those killed by police their arrest records were released to shame them michael was on probation for a misdemeanor last year and years ago sandlin was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in los angeles according to his relatives sandlin had a rough life but had turned it around and was working as a successful truck driver sadly these children will now grow up knowing that their parents were taken from them by cops scared of a sleeping couple share google concerned citizen perhaps the mother had the gun on her lap for protection while they slept at least they didnt drive drunk these parents did not deserve to die mary hagerty did she really have a gun or did the cops just say that to excuse the murders of two sleeping people lying about weapons is a known police tactic to get out of trouble sometimes they go as far as to plant a weapon conscious lets say they had a gun how did the police see it if they were asleep hmmm that makes it irrelevant john and linda robel who gives a fuck about driving drunk it is determined by an arbitrary number that is extorted by the united states congresswe encourage people everyday to annul this police statist horseshit a felony can be expunged but not a fucking misdomeanor dui get a grip this nothing but a government racket and proffiteering of the dui industry kevin burnett sounds like more blackliesmatter twits alan lammle sounds more like bluethugliesmatter twits duryea l williams smhignorance is contagious talisha harris no where in the article talks about that movement from the article it sounds like innocent people who were not armed and who were sleep were killed did i miss something anon ymous they may or may not have had a gun but having a gun is no reason for the police to shoot kill someone nikkia bailey maybe they were too drunk to drive anon ymous black lives matter also what part of that is so hard to understand kburnett isanidiot stop being an ignorant fuckwad racist troll kevin turdnett philip williams ryan robbins marie laveaux im not disagreeing with you i just always like to see some real info before i jump to conclusions not just a headline i have no idea what happened and will not put blame on either side unless i see some hard evidence julie asperger on los angeles local news report they said the vehicle was stopped in the middle of manchester blvd not parked on the side of the road both are illegal seemed strange the way it was presented to us this makes it even weirder i passed by and seen there is a large memorial for them to bad there is no video to see what really happened cops dont like being filmed for obvious reasons julie asperger yea i was harassed by some a few years back on hollywood blvd and intimidated into deleting video of them using excessive force on cooperating men i even showed them my press id and tried to be allowed to keep the video they said fuck the press kimberly reichard emerson the intelligent of us know were not i cant even comprehend whats wrong with the people here that still believe were in the land of the free and home of the brave its frightening to say the least shawn soto this is so fucked upwtf is wrong with people why cant any one just act right all you fuckers carrying so much hate on raceits ridiculous im sick of it an alot if peeps an i mean alot are following an feeding this shit through media an all i hve mad love for all race in the world am does any one even hve a pure blood line now a days i think not so dont be fooled by just the way your skin looks we all belong to the human race theres no other race than that thom prentice nice infotisments colin parker i never understood why their prior arrest recods are released its not admissible in any court for a current charge so why are the police allowed to use it alan lammle to help soften the public in their attempt to make them look like they did nothing wrong in shooting people in cold blood gary harryman shouldnt the records of every cop at that scene also be released tray pressley to label them as criminals so they can justify the murder markymark ndahouse to demonize the dead jamesawyatt as long as bureaucrats are allowed to hire with little or no supervision those who seek to be employed as cops many of whom have a history of being bullies going back through their childhood and who seek this means of furthering their bullying lust now armed with impressive uniform shiny new badge and deadly weapons and with the presumptions that they now have a license to beat cripple and shoot when ever and whom ever they please atrocities are expected to be the norm and will be expected to grow at an exponential rate it is forever hoped that one or more law firms will come into being that will relentlessly undertake the filing of suits and not only agains the involved jurisdiction and the individual rogue cop or cops but those who were involved in the hiring of the cop or cops the impression always being that these who are responsible for the hiring and thus are as guilty as the involved rogue cops they have to be faced with the harsh reality by having levied against each and every offender hugh awardsfines not just on the jurisdiction ie the city county state or feds but also against each of the individual involved in their being hirsd as well as the rogue cop or cops themselves as individuals the awards to be paid by the individuals by their prorated award share payment out of their own pockets and only a prorated share by the jurisdiction as what the jurisdiction pays will invariably come out of the pockets of that jurisdictions tax payers stiff penalties in the form of huge financial judgement awards should go a long long way in fostering an awareness by these who have escaped accountability for so so long of the potentially very expensive folly of this their irresponsible actions which results in so much suffering and many time crippling injury andor death mary hagerty i agree but please dont use all caps to write its way harder to read roberto carlos moscoso sadly the government insists that they want to take guns away from civilians for only police officers have training and are responsible enough to handle guns yet ive seen more mass shootings and innocent people dying in the hands of cops than in the hands of irresponsible citizens crazy ah tracy walling otis is that true marco emilio giovanni maltese thats truly horrifying if so if you have a source of those statistics i would appreciate the link for it i know its bad im not denying that but i am even more disgusted if it is that bad ive read that cops killed more than people in the usa in the last years but im sorry i dont have the link you can search and you will find it easily i think usa people should be more scared of cops than of terrorists alain vosselman im stunned i can no longer believe this this is going to be talked about in the future if we still have one just as we talk now about stalins regime or sadam husseins or pol pot from now on even if we discover new life triljon lightyears away traveling by megasuperfreakaliesh tech vehicles well still be the most amazing embiciles of the universe aaron beedle the fact that there are enough of these stories coming from america for several to be posted everyday proves how messed up the place is i would not want to be a black person living in america today i wouldnt live there at all nothing will happen to the officers they should be sentenced for murder and receive a full sentence police officers over there intruding on peoples property and killing pets killing people just walking down the street or washing their car id i was an american the only reason id want to own a gun was to defend my self against police officers ryan robbins you shouldnt believe everything you are reading online its bad right now but its not nearly as bad as many are making it out to be all of these innocent victims are not nearly as innocent as they are initially made out to be when the truth finally comes out on most of these stories its on page and nobody takes the time to post it because it does not fuel there agenda to spread hate and prejudice aaron beedle it is true everyone has agendas im sure there are a lot of people in general dying in america but i know from life that the people with the power are usually the assholes i would say that at least of all male human beings struggle to handle power reasonably females would be close too when it is appointed rather than earned such as when someone is called a police officer and given a weapon that can kill people with ease people tend to not handle it well i heard a while ago that some parts of the world do not use equipment they would not fire at themselves and they are made to it teaches people restraint christopher rawson the police across america are being demonized by a sickness in the system that wants to put us against one another that human is a human none of us our without fault or live life without ever feeling in over our headpossibly there is another way tim walker i suppose if everyone voted for that one independentlibertarian candidate then maybe we would have a fighting chance sadly that will never happen the vast majority of people have been brainwashed by the two main parties with the division they have created they can easily put in any candidate they choose how can anyone prove that it wasnt predetermined i just watched a news video of this story the mayor said the couple were passed out when police arrived police spent minutes trying to rouse them and deescalate the situation how is there a situation to deescalate if they are passed out ryan said nowhere in his comment that they deserved what happened all he said was that another source had different information if another source has clashing info of course one of them is going to be wrong no need to bash him vanessa white some groups must be trying to start to a race conflict and some are just happy with anarchy i would never call them for anything they dont seem to know who or when to shoot or maybe they are all amped up on steroids all the time pitiful i will keep the children in prayer blue thugs all cops are cowards never seen one that wasnt a coward and bully one of the cops got tired of waiting and said gun that was all the excuse they needed to open fire what if that was a white couple with a gun in the carnearly everyone has a gun on person or in the car these days what if they have a permit or concealed carry permit do you fucking think the cops would have fired rounds into that car and killed the white couple well do you if one of the thug cops did holler gun no one can ever say anything to contradict them cops know if only one side is left alive no one can say otherwise better to be judged by than carried by that is every cops motto as they know they are above the laws for mere mortal humans linda brown chickenshit bullies this bs has to stop i belive all you say as i have been targeted in canada first nations peopledrunk drive teens and pot smokers are all targets where i live every skin color fair game on last two for sure these peace officers should be heald accountable face an open hearing open to public a fair trial and then deal with courts decision im not sure if this happened to my friends it would not end in graveyard these murders must face charges and hopefully murder one usn veteran bt i respect your opinion however do not fully agree with you i do know a few leos good stock adult scout leaders and there was an officer from my childhood past whom mentored me however i can not defend other leos actions i firmly believe that an armed society is a polite society arizona state constitutional provision article section the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself or the state shall not be impaired but nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize maintain or employ an armed body of men arizona respects the right of all us citizens to carry a concealed handgun with or without a permit or to carry openly while in this state an arizona resident permit can be obtained for the purposes of carrying concealed while in other states that offer recognition or reciprocity castle doctrine enacted right to carry confidentiality provisions enacted right to carry in restaurants legal right to carry laws no permit required right to carry reciprocity and recognition outright recognition right to keep bear arms state constitutional provisions with provisions as such arizona has fewer crimes per capita committed with a firearm as does california how does extrapolate these facts perhaps as arizonians have come to accept firearms as a know factor in their daily lives whereas californians do not perhaps californias draconian laws encroach upon human mental health whereby inhibiting residents of the state of california to live in fear rather than confidence i for one shall leave this contemptuous state seeking solitude of which only a truly free society can bring i shall make arizona my final resting place i expect in this forum environment there may be egregious comments to the final resting place i respect all of my fellow american citizens and their constitutional right to express their opinions as protected by the united states constitutional first amendment usn veteran margie campbellthreadgill maybe i missed something in the article but does it state that the cops fired rounds in the car if so i missed it fed xxx department of justice has statistics on police killings and being white doesnt make you immune in fact more whites were killed by police than blacks in the last years doesnt excuse this horrible murder of an innocent couple but please dont fall prey to deluded thinking that being white makes a difference look for yourself how is anyone white or black ever supposed to trust a police officer these days blue thugs fuck you dude my dad is a good cop and i judge his actions too you are biased im not and leave ppl alone they never bother with flat tires so fuck off chris cochran every single one of these cops needs to be charged with murder and the police need to pay to make those kids end up having a good life since they will never have their parents to give them one gary harryman yes every cop at that scene is guilty of the same crime since they acted as a gang they should stand trial as a gang and all be charged with the same crime murder terri spanjer i wish people would stop and think for a minute about how the government is allowing police to murder citizens and that over the last years these incidents are occurring a hundred times a year its all part of the big plan to remove all your rights and terrify you ps yes was an inside job think american cops have been given free rein to do whatever they want the government encourages police brutality lucas vegen i dont understand maybe im to young maybe the uk is completely different black lives are being slaughtered even in their sleep and we sit and watch idol i learned at a young age the country will only change when its forced to black people need to stand up we are not shooting practice and we will raid stores court rooms and banks in the s or s if money and property is all they care about more may die but we all die eventually and will die sooner if we watch idol this is the world you want to live and raise your kids in really this is not hate talk but black lives matter marches and speeches should be the calm before the storm if they continue to kill us and our children in our sleep i dont think talking should be our last effort how many more will die it wont theyre killing everyone now desiree m mondesir insane i know all cops are not like this but the ones who aregod help them or rather god help the people they senselessly murder and their remaining loved ones how on earth does a sleeping couple threaten you causing you to fear for your life b alan eisen i fell asleep in my truck on a very cold night in front of my house a police officer wanted to arrest me for sleeping in it but the night was so cold he got numb hands and left ross thompson laurie choate this of course will be swept under the rug as quickly as possible they messed up bad on this one i would love to see the dash cams vids but im sure that too is now gone very sad that we can no longer trust any person in uniform how does one deescalate a situation where the occupants of the car are asleep david lynn courtney freaking terrible and shameful roomtempiq the entire legal system is skewed in favor of those who have money no doubt black folks are unfairly targetedabusedkilled by cops but us poor white folks get cop abuse as well but us poor whites dont seem to be killed by cops as often as black folks that being said i recently moved to a very rural county and the sherriffs deputies here are standup good guys they are not cowards or bullies that is one reason i moved here b alan eisen i wouldnt compare rural life with inner city life at all rural people respect each other they help each other the police are neighbors you can explain inner city hell to yourself in the police in usa murdered black people and white people total killed of all was so far in the police in usa murdered black people and white people total killed so far as of february is but more whites than blacks you say simple only black lives matter to the main stream media their mission is to promote an agenda to put us common folk against one another also imagine if us whites acted like blacks when we have one of our own killed by police when are whites going to loot and riot thomas headen iii you riot when your sports teams lose or win for that matter percentages sir say that black men are times more likely to be killed by police than white men i think if the percentage were reversed you would be alarmed as well god bless michael mcmaster to put it in perspective if police were shooting people in a colourblind fashion then youd expect that for every people shot of them would be black and would be white or to put it another way left handed people are about of the population if it turned out that year after year they were of the people killed by police it would be fair to ask why they were being singled out disproportionally anna black whites loot and riot during sports the real question is where is the all lives matter when this happens daniel robins one yahoocom woops they did it again todd schacherl so now sleeping while black is a capital offense if only they had cooperated while sleeping they wouldnt have been shot is that what we are to believe deloren tucker wtf john and linda robel the blue code of silence is well established and routinely used tim egan wrote breaking blue a book that documents the historical corruption of these big brave heroes orwell was right big brother is watching and the pigs are running the farm line these pos up for the firng squad and make their families watch john and linda robel keep voting for democrats all

officers i bet a thousand to a cops doughnut there was no gun even in the car if so it was planted after killing them probably stayce wow i didnt know things were this bad it just seems that being black is so wrong anymore why do these things keep happening i just ask that all cops and law enforcement be mindful of what they are doing and double check their situation before over reacting now kids are without parents this is ridiculous bless the babies and their parents lincoln kirby huh i always thought the conscious scared the police more ie us oh wait they cant tell whos conscious and who isnt why was i born with less rights than my parents and my younger family member born with less freedoms than i was born with the fuck happened did we stop thinking fuck these kind of mother

pussy ass pigs smfh deloren tucker when r we going to start fighting back deloren tucker police are only human like us anthony georgeson this has to stop this is insane orphans unarmed people killed by those who are supposed to serve and protect crazed gunmen killing indiscriminately this isnt the wild west this is a war zone i know guns can be a tool as much as a wepon a knife a stick a rock a fist can be a deadly wepon how do we fix this start making every stich of clothing out of kevlar replace fluoride with prozac can we learn anything from places that dont have a problem like iceland it has to stop the officers involved should have been interviewed by civilians before the went to police academy maybe they werent good with serve and protect show me the video dksman wtf this article is full of major inaccuracies they werent parked on the side of the road they were in the middle of a major street right in front of an intersection they didnt pull over and go to sleep all you have to do is loom at the crime scene photos and see this article is full of false information they had a gun on them as well catherine durnfordwang so for that they deserve to be shot and they had a gun so what again arent guns allowed under the second amendment zatanique how does a sleeping couple put anybody into a state of fear for their lives i smell a cover up of monumental proportions by the cops involved i cant believe that they could possibly find a plausible reason to justify opening fire on these two people not only do i want to see a special grand jury called to deal with these cops police department and city i want to see a wrongful death suit brought against them the police department and the city because of these cops children are without their parents no amount of money is going to make that better or make up for what they did on what planet could you possibly justify what happened smh for real i cannot even grasp this if they were not conscious why didnt they try to make sure they were not suffering from co poisoning oh no lets just shoot them and make up any story we like huh david sbraga if you only had the courage to say that to someone face and not while th were hiding behind a kevlar and screen id pray for you but i dont believe in prayer and i dont believe it would do you any good mark nasia parents on a date were asleep in their car does this headline make sense i mean two people shot while sleeping in their car makes more sense that date would have happened before they decided to sleep where are the editors these days jevez robinson paul myers surely the same laws should be used and policemen and the hiring officials as is used against gangs and organised crime lets face it the police force is the biggest organisation of organised criminals in the world blacks latinos asians and progressives must compete and vie for every civil service job once on rise in rank and change the system genevieve friday king two exhausted parents falling asleep in a car in and of itself not news hell ive been at work and college and found parents zonked out from exhaustion from parentingbut to be executed like this uh were the cops afraid the parents would wake up and ground them for a week or a stern talking to johndca marible these cops need to stop it so were suppose to believe that this woman and this man with children between them are in a car that late at night just waiting to threaten cops with a gun were really suppose to believe that story i dont understand how cops can be so afraid when they have a license to carry a gun training on top of that a partner and access to call for backup i just dont get it if youre that afraid of a black person on sight then you dont need to be a police officer you need to seek help last time i checked it was black people getting killed by the police and not the other way around yeah the cops have a handful of tragedies but it cannot compare to the numbers when you talk about deaths of blacks by police not by a longshot im getting really tired of this and the whole usa needs to revamp its law enforcement system you can give guns to cops who are suppose to protect and serve but where is the protection for the rest of us jeff putterman,1

obama will not get a majority of the white vote but he will get enough to beat mr mccain why will so many whites vote for mr obama first some support his policies they want to end the war in iraq and they want the standard liberal program of socialized medicine higher taxes more handouts and more government there has always been a substantial minority of whites who vote this way and they have a

that rising above racism is americas sacred calling one must never underestimate the importance to whites of feeling virtuous most would rather lose a leg than be thought a bigot and a vote for obama is a painless way to burnish antiracist credentials third young whites will line up for mr obama they have been swallowing antiwhite multiculti propaganda all their lives and have not knocked around enough to discover it is false some who know their parents will vote for mr mccain will make a special point of voting for mr obama every new generation thinks it is cooler hipper and wiser than any generation that ever lived and what could be cooler hipper or wiser than putting a black man in the white house for many young whites a vote for mr obama will be a denial of every uncool unhip and especially every even faintly racerealist thing their parents ever said or did fourth although the country seems to have a collective memory of no more than two weeks americans think everything is historic whenever someone breaks an obscure record in professional baseball we are told history was made if you ask someone why he waited in line all night to buy the first apple iphone he will tell you its a historic product americans love anything that is historic and for people who think a few more stolen bases are history right up there with the battle of lepanto putting a black man in the white house will be the discovery of america pearl harbor and the second coming all rolled into one many whites will vote for mr obama because they want to think they helped make history the media which has its own grim reasons for supporting mr obama is mesmerized by the same prospect editors salivate at the thought of writing headlines like history is made the day after the election and some will lose all selfcontrol and add an exclamation mark the emphasis of course will be on mr obama as the first black president implying more to come the media which always subtly boost the democrat will be even more blatantly partisan this time downplaying every blunder mr obama makes and highlighting mr mccains fifth many whites will vote for mr obamaor at least not vote for mr mccainbecause the republicans have nominated the most stunningly unattractive candidate in years old and pockmarked mr mccain is thoroughly disliked in the senate for arrogance that he cannot even hide from voters when he is not speaking from notes he has dismayed republicans by promoting amnesty for illegals and dismayed everyone else by saying america should stay in iraq for years if it takes that long to win mr obama therefore has the enormous advantage of running against an opponent that not even republicans like mr obama will also crush mr mccain in facetoface debates mr mccain cannot put an unscripted sentence together any better than george w bush can and will come across as a thickwitted geezer mr obama who is as glib as any politician gives credence to hl menckens definition of democracy as rule by orators but what about americas storied racism isnt america brimming with people who cant bear the thought of a black president americans have been numbed for decades by attractive televisionblacks who read the news forecast the weather and tell us which brand of toothpaste to buy americans get a steady diet of heroic movieblacks who outsmart and beat up white brutes solve baffling technical problems dispense sage advice and save the world even the current miss usa is black there are millions of whites who do not want to live with blacks or have much to do with them but would a black president be much different from nearly eight years of black secretaries of state the march of blackness may be vaguely worrying to whites but they think there is nothing they can do about it and that they shouldnt even if they could the final reason why whites will vote for mr obama is that the republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work if they were serious they would fill the airways with jeremiah wright prancing and raving along with the message this is the man who married mr and mrs obama baptized their children and whom mr obama calls a family member they would buy radio ads quoting michelle obamas thesis in which she says she will always be black first and american second mr mccain has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this many blacks probably think he has the stomach for considerably worse percent think mr obama is in greater physical danger than any white politician and many say they would have warned him not to run for fear he would be killed an assassination would certainly be a shattering event there is no telling how many cities would go up in flames and thirdworld countries which have followed the obama nomination with unprecedented interest would help make it the most widely reported killing in history i have just returned from a muslim country in which everyone has heard of mr obama and likes him but most have never heard of john mccain whatever gruesome fantasies blacks may be spinning however assassination has gone out of style in america and white resistancesuch as it isis dependably nonviolent mr obama will be perfectly safe in any case mr obama will win far more white votes than he will lose because he is black whites who dont want a black president would not vote for a democrat anyway as for black voters even nominal republicans are said to be running for the doors but strictly racial voting has always been fine for blacks not so for whites of course just try telling your coworkers that you disagree with mr mccain but are voting for him because he is white racially conscious whites will be in a quandary in november even if mr mccains policies are worse than mr obamas should they vote for the white manone with an adopted bangladeshi daughter and who long ago betrayed white interests even after years of being softened up with black heroes and figureheads a black in the white house is a powerful symbol of white dispossession a mulatto president is an almost explicit endorsement of miscegenation this is bitter medicine some whites have argued that a black president would undercut the charges of racism whites are forever facing but they are dreaming the entire government could look like a meeting of the mystic knights of the sea but as long as blacks are worse off than whites we will be blamed for it sensible whites cannot cheerfully vote for either man i suspect most will stay home or vote for a minor candidate aside from the symbolic impact which cannot be calculated will president obama be much different from a president hillary clinton she would lard her cabinet with blacks and hispanics nominate ultraliberal judges push for amnesty grovel before nonwhites everywhere and load up the civil rights division of the justice department with antiwhite sharks she would certainly make a bigger fool of herself over hispanics and asians see turning up the pressure ar may our choice therefore could not be more disagreeable on balance we get to decide which is the more degrading spectacle deluded white people giving their country away or cleareyed blacks helping themselves to it president obama will however face special pressures he cant let the pushier brothers walk all over him but he will have to throw them enough bones to keep them off his back it will be a tricky balance mr obamas first annual address to the naacp will be a love feast but every year after that it will be harder to explain why black unemployment poverty and incarceration rates havent changed at all even mr obamas starstruck white supporters will eventually wonder what happened to all that change he promised there is not going to be change the system is far too stuck in its selfserving ways for that with the help of an enlarged democratic majority in congress mr obama may set up some wheezing byzantine form of socialized medicine but no one will be happy with it if mr obama inherits a sick economy a weak dollar expensive oil and shrinking revenues americans will not at all like the change they get on the bright side with mr obama we have a good chance of piquant firstlady behavior what will the white house be like with michelle in charge will she want a new exterior paint job how and whom will she entertain will the big mans guest bedroomsin the african traditionbe turned over to third cousins from kenya and the south side of chicago there is no telling with what improprieties large and small mrs obama will entertain us as she makes up her mind whether she is an american it will be an edifying presidency and whites may be a little less deluded in,0

those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavyhanded and brutal clamp down by police and national guard militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with lrad sonic weapons attack dogs tear gas tazers and even live ammunition killing horses while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up but as the saying goes water is life and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement therefore for people concerned with life giving up on this is simply unthinkable the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism and the perception that money is more important than life itself when the police and national guard attack us citizens on private property to protect corporate interests who are they really working for the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren ceo of energy transfer partners the company responsible for the project so who is kelcy warren a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering warren worked in the natural gas industry and became cochair of energy transfer equity in with business partner ray davis coowner of the texas rangers baseball team warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nations largest pipeline companies which now owns about miles of pipelines carrying natural gas natural gas liquids refined products and crude oil the companys holdings include sunoco southern union and regency energy partners forbes estimates the yearold warrens personal wealth at billion bloomberg described him as among americas new shale tycoons but rather than building a fortune by drilling he takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another chilling boiling pressurizing and processing it until its worth more than when it burst from the wellhead source shockingly in the governor of texas greg abbott appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another million pipeline project according to the governors office the state parks and wildlife commission manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas along with ensuring the future of hunting fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans source this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post his petition is described here most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline the dallasbased billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fasttracking a mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation no environmental impact assessment no respect for cultural sites and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river a similar story is unfolding out in west texas where warrens company has split through the pristine big bend region with the mile comanche trail pipeline and nearlycomplete mile trans pecos pipeline these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a year term as of the commissioners who preside over texas parks and

takes the decisions it seems that we have to turn towards russia once more for our recommended daily dose of normal masculinity as red pill and coldblooded as it gets brother brat in russian is a movie directed by alexey balabanov it is seen by many as the one of the greatest gangster movie of all time and changed forever the image of the traditional justiceseeking hero it has been a few years at least that i want to share my discovery of this film with our readers it had a tremendous impact on the way i see the world and the attitude i have towards life i was convinced of its quality of the impact it could have on the disciples of the red pill and that a few lines cannot do justice to this giant of russian cinema culture it entirely deserves an article of its own my brother the criminal enter danila bagrov played by the stellar sergey bodrov who died at at the peak of his meteorlike career many called him the russian james dean after serving in the bloody war theatre of chechnya young veteran danila returns home in the sleepy provincial town of tula needing money and without any solid prospects he joins his brother vytia who works as a hitman for the local welldressed businessman in saint petersburg being an expert in making rudimentary weapons and with his quick capacity of reaction and frugality danila adapts marvelously to his new occupation after seeing the risk of a gifted concurrent stealing their livelihood the citys gangsters soon put a price on his head and send a few professionals to tie up this loose end but even after being betrayed by a mix of greed and cowardice young danila bagrov decides to take on the mob single handedly an epitome of the russian alpha hard and unforgiving sober in words and in behaviour for whom nothing counts more than the bonds of blood and brotherhood to err is human his one soft spot is the faith he has in human nature convinced that if he does good his fellow man will be virtuous in return he could not be more wrong especially with women he discovers very fast that beta moves like buying them gifts and helping them only brings him trouble or ungratefulness what is rare and makes danila stand out is his loyalty a cornerstone of the definition of masculinity and a value that progressively vanishes nowadays his brother will do the unthinkable but after the storm clears and danila emerges victorious he proves once more his quality as a man by being magnanimous and giving him a second chance no fancy green screen or politically correct themes brat is good because it is painfully real and does not embellish the lawless chaos that was early postsoviet russia this is how it felt when the wall came down everyone was trying to survive the best way they could the odd lowquality orange filter used in the film reminds us of this period where everything was made from what people could find when the shelves where empty you cannot go wrong with a good revenge movie and danila is an example of bravery alone and against all odds he takes on the mafia that wronged him and will make them pay the man says it like it is his analysis of the city and its perverse influence on men is brutally accurate danila you told me about the city about its strength but here everyone is weak hoffman the city is a great and terrible force it sucks the life force out of the strong turns them weak it takes away your power and you fell right in the middle of it his opinion about the abuse of power and the corrupt elites that would kill mother and father for their own profit and the final victory of truth applies especially well to todays political and social context american whats your power is it really money my brother says its money youve got lots of money so what truth is a real power whoever is right is strong you cheated on a man and took away his money did it make you stronger no it did not cause you are not right and the person you cheated on is that means hes stronger right brother also drops lethal truths about women and their ways after spending all his roubles buying drinks and dope for a young interchangeable skank she tells danila kate do you have condoms danila why kate why you really think i will give you back your money come here two brothers for two majestic films the second volume simply titled brother breaks the stereotype that sequels are always awful and is at least as good if not better than the original same characters are followed but this time danilas brother in arms has been played by a crooked american businessman in touch with the muscovite mafia they attacked his brothers once more and he will have this time to cross the atlantic to reclaim what is rightfully his again the movie is realistic gritty but has a lighter outlook on life whereas in the first volume the main character showed a sheer hatred for everything that came from america and corrupted his country the sequel that involves danilas adventures and clueless discovery of american culture often results in hilarious encounters un film qui prend aux tripes if the red pill was a religion danila bagrov could be its patron saint you can watch it legally following this link which

female indiana jones brand andré is a young european who left his decaying country in for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november girls the paris catacombs are a place dear to my heart born in this very city i had a front row seat to see it turn into a giant museum every wealthy asshole wanting his own piece of the city of lights and paris being one of the most visited cities in the world i could see year after year the streets taken over by luxury clothing shops and expensive venues the middle and lower classes have been pushed aside by rising living costs so that the rich globalists the bobos and a neverending trail of tourists could stroll around yet go twenty meters below the haussmanian hurdle and you will find something very different south of the seine the lands have been deeply dug to extract building stones most of the voids have been filled since but more than a hundred kilometres of mine galleries are still there exploring the place is officially forbidden which is a good thing as one can go there officiously provided one knows how to enter and not get lost in the labyrinth without bothering with swarms of tourists or wasting money in an overpriced bar officially prohibited actually more or less selfmanaged by a loose community of cataphiles the catacombs are one of the most interesting places today in paris it allows for genuine explorations and friendly meetings while also teaching some masculine virtues to those who venture there seriously the underground network being fragile and the officials not enjoying when too many visitors tread on their jurisdiction the cataphiles have a complex relationship with exposing it on the one hand we like to show the place and share its atmosphere with passionate newcomers on the other we are afraid that too much exposition will attract too many visitors and stifle the officials relative toleration for unofficial activities well today other cataphiles wont chastise me for mentioning the topic in public for this has been already made recently by an attention whore of international scope alison teal a hawaiian or years old girl made a show of herself down there and sent ludicrous photos to the daily mail so im here to teach you about protecting the planet yknow i love bringing surfboards in places without waves by the way im the feminine indiana jones especially with the help of a crew ill never give credit to follow me on instagram and yt here we are not talking about attention whoring lightly the daily mail photos already tell much a blond girl in a pink bikini carries a pink surfboard in a narrow underground network where there is by definition no waves to surf at all to take some photos of herself herself herself and a bit of the catacombs as they could be used as the setting of the latest of alisons adventures im not joking these adventures are literally hitler a trademark since she was at least teal seems to have taken advantage from the nomadic lifestyle of her parents to make photos movies and promote herself heavily along the way with the help of her dad a wellconnected photographer and selfpromoter who claims to master yoga she got a bunch of awards and media promotion longhaired alison was thus handed a niche that allows her to travel the world take pictures of herself in various places and claim to be concerned about the environment her résumé shows a massive ego associated to minor lies the world was my school and playgroundi guess smaller places would be too small for her giant ego and this may explain why she suffered from claustrophobia under paris as we are to see below between namedroppings references to media awards and other big pictures of alison teal and alison teal we learn she was styled the female indiana jones by time magazine and the oprah of adventure by the huffington post really actually teal said to the huffpo she aspired to be the oprah of adventure in before branding herself as the female indiana jones to the time a year later not then she said on twitter and on her résumé how they had referred to her as such not a big lie but a lie indeed by the way she also branded herself a tarzan child in the huffpo interview would someone who really grew up in the wild be so obsessed with linking herself to famous icons excerpt from the huffpo article the same articles adds she is a selfdescribed tarzan child excerpt from the time article named by time magazine or selfstyled and now on her résumé not only does she lie by misattributing to famous media outlets selfcharacterizing and lavishly flattering labels but she cant even put the right years while referring to said media pieces so selfstyled female indiana jones no less went through what seems to be a joint undertaking with the daily mail by descending into the paris catacombs with the symbols of her adventures namely a pink bikini and a surfboard the english tabloid released the photos video and testimony of indianajonesinabikinisurfingthecatacombs the th of october days after a bunch of french outlets copied the mail content often translating it verbatim what struck me first are the stunning inaccuracies the tabloid published first the mail claims teal went meters below the ground whereas the actual depth of the catacombs goes between and meters depending on where you are in the network cant indiana jane tell the difference between and meters second she also claimed to have lacked oxygen and witnessed the water level suddenly rising this is at best extremely unlikely the water levels can change from month to month and even from week to week but to my knowledge it never changes abruptly in seconds as for the oxygen issue i have witnessed some only two times at a big party when so many people were in the same room that there was not enough oxygen to light a cigarette and from claustrophobic newcomers who could not stand the place either she completely made up the sudden water change and oxygen issues in order to give her story a sensational aspect or more likely got a panic attack due to claustrophobia but preferred to twist it into a grandiose plot rather than acknowledging her own limitations the mail just ate that up and published without question they did not ask any actual cataphile for sure had they done so anyone with a decent experience of the catacombes could have told them what i just wrote above i also noticed from her quotes that she does not mention anyone from her crew gives no credit to the men who opened the manhole cover helped her go down the humid ladder showed her the way filmed her she would never have found the entrance if no one already in the know had accepted to be her guide neither could she lift manhole covers of more than a hundred kilograms with her thin armseven the round butt she likes to display couldnt do that the first photo displayed by the mail notice how she strategically displays some of her butt i could bet she did not have sex with any of the guys who enabled her display to happen as julius evola hinted she is likely the kind of woman to whom the possibilities of physical love are often not as interesting as the narcissistic cult of her body or as being seen with as many or as few clothes as possible evola revolt against the modern world chap in this respect the only thing that makes teal special compared to all other lookatme twats is the adventurous label she tries to put on herself exploiting people and places to garner attention is definitely not special yet a lot of comments have noticed this behind the weird mix of glamour and pseudoadventure some are offended that she treaded on bones ie remnants of real past men in a pink bikini doing so is not only a proof of bad taste and selfaggrandizing maniait is also utterly disrespectful this is indeed a blatant example of pussy pass imagine going to hawaii bringing a skateboard at a local cemetery and start skateboarding over the graves in a pink throng what do you expect would happen you would probably get beaten by locals and if the media gave you attention at all they would label you as a disturbed troll or something like that all this i think would be fair but when a selfimportant oprah jane of superadventure does the same the mainstream media reacts completely differently and celebrates her without the least hint of criticism though she treading and surfing on bones of actual past people is not very respectful for sure i think especially appalling the outlook teal seems to carry on the place the catacombs are just another background for alison adventures whole places some loaded with historical and spiritual significance are reduced to a set for the egotic show of another vapid character the entire world was her school or so she said meaning that the world is turned into a mixture of disneyland and hollywood studio where her picture can stroll around some weeks ago alison teal was busy showing herself near an erupting volcano notice another strategic partdisplay of her butt usual newcomers to the catacombs come there with a genuine interest in the place they come to find out sometimes drink and have an actual adventure they cannot help but feel some humility perhaps even awe when meeting with the bones of millions of nameless dead most if not all of them having lived before the nineteenth century and having been carried there so that paris could grow this is very different from using the place to play adventure treading on bones in a rather inappropriate outfit depending on a crew of real cataphiles but forgetting to give them the slightest credit and showing utter carelessness to the historical and spiritual significance of the place all so that alisons ego adventures show continues as you can see above a lot of the comments are negativeespecially those from cataphiles and teal has discreetly withdrawn the video of her trail from youtube putting it into private mode teals circus has at least one merit it symbolizes pretty well one of the worst aspects of the westernization of the world in the west there is no wilderness no sacredness no magic there are tons of potential places for tourism but ultimately all these places are losing their soul and turning into disneylands the catacombs are worth it because they are definitely not so and should never be fortunately there can be some immanent justice the wave of criticism under teals disrespectful show is well deserved more harshly a young libtard who thought she could hitchhike through middle east to prove muslims peaceful got raped and killed by the peaceful ones she theatrically claimed to care about the event shew or should have shown that the world is not a giant kindergarten for western strong and independent narcissists in a world of selfmarketing and selfcentred cunts everyone is too busy caring about ones image and about meaningless representations to truly care about a place or about family members truly respectable women are not the ones we spot the most easily and true cataphiles are often discreet as well your humble servant bathed there before teal pretended to surf the place but i would definitely not exhibit myself treading on bones in a pink thong,0

the taliban unfortunately for him after september american forces went to war with the taliban he was captured on november after his unit surrendered in kunduz the cia questioned him and he claimed to be an irishman that must have been an interesting conversation perhaps ach begorrah top o the mornin to ye presumably pretending to be black again wouldnt have gotten him very far shortly after the captive jihadis staged a bloody uprising and lindh escaped hundreds died including mike spann one of his interrogators after that he was recaptured andfollowing some rough treatment not that im shedding any tears about itquestioned again he announced defiantly that he wasnt in the taliban but rather al qaeda his actions sealed his doom fighting for the taliban fruitcakes was a pretty dumb move on his part his actions after being captured were even dumber what could he have done differently in the beginning he couldve said he was interested in islam and his quest for discovering his spiritual roots took him abroad then he could have lied and told them he was pressganged into the taliban and he was quite happy to be freed by his countrymen he could have tipped off his interrogators about the planned escape attemptpotentially sparing many lives on both sidesas well as avoiding further criminal charges for himself had he given a helpful warning about the uprising likely they wouldve concluded he was small fry and let him go after that he couldve become the star of the daytime tv talk shows then he couldve given speeches on the antiwar circuit helping his jihadi buddies by saying they really arent that bad or whatever instead he ended up faced with ten criminal charges which couldve meant three life sentences plus ninety years finally getting smart he copped a plea for twenty years with the possibility of three off for good behavior now hes in federal prison making the news back in by suing for the right to be allowed group prayer what went wrong as bush the elder put it lindh was some misguided marin county hottubber later he apologized profusely for the remark still i have to say that bush was onto something with that one all the criticism he got from that was because the truth hurts things couldve been different lindh didnt have to become a renegade if hed made other choices he could be living a happy life as a productive member of society rather than counting the days in a prison cell still his environment bears some responsibility for what he became he was raised in the catholic faith but a stronger grounding in itas well as explaining some of the unpleasant realities about islam to balance out the picture might have put the kibosh on his journey to jihad a liberal environment should at least be able to explain why all thats bad or has liberalism become too wishywashy to assert its own values there wasnt much chance of parental guidance turning him from the wrong path his mother converted to buddhism and his father left for the gay community for that matter if he had acquired an appreciation for good musicbe it mozart or metallicaperhaps he wouldnt have been so fascinated by irritating rap music what kind of white kid is so alienated from his heritage that he pretends to be black and laughably accuses dr dre of selling out on that note as for malcolm x didnt lindh have some cultural icons of his own i have to wonder if he received much grounding in his own irishamerican heritage all this is an illustration of what can happen when an impressionable adolescent is cast adrift in an anything goes environment islam speaks in absolutes enjoining right conduct and forbidding haram conduct and they fight for what they believe in i cant fault them too much for that although i disagree with their theology and actions on many points going further islam offers paradise for believerspromising seventy virgins to their martyrsand eternal hellfire and brimstone for the damned theres nothing wishywashy about it indeed embracing radical islam could be interpreted as an utter rejection of the anything goes world view i certainly dont agree with lindhs choices but i can see how he found that compelling in comparison to being at sea in moral relativism this certainly isnt the first time that people turned their backs on their countries and went abroad to give aid and comfort to the enemy jane fondas north vietnam adventure comes to mind an action she now regrets more recently there were about five hundred misguided youths who volunteered to be human shields in iraq for their pal saddam for all their posturing none of them got themselves blown up over there leaving aside the question of whether or not the resumption of war was justified fewer social justice warriors wouldve helped cleanse the gene pool a bit then theres the odd case of matthew todd miller a californian who went to north korea tore up his visa and announced he was seeking political asylum that ones an iffy case though later he said i just wanted to speak to an ordinary north korean person about normal things kids these days in summary dont let this happen to our youth they must not grow up culturally bereft in times past children were taught about their countrys heritage instructed in their culture and pride in their nation was instilled in them it was a given that these were presented as good things these daysat least in much of the western worldthis isnt happening we cant count on the educational systemand certainly the mediato do that any more because of decades of cultural marxism young people are indoctrinated with a negative view of their own civilization all societies beliefs and ways of life are equal except yours are terrible those who dont see through that baloney end up rootless alienated and disconnected from their own culture some even end up thinking that their homeland is the embodiment of all evil while repressive regimes abroad are wonderful this is basically what social justice weenies think something they have in common with young jihadi rebels without a clue this will have to change of course hopefully the day will come when the media manipulators and educational bureaucrats who pushed cultural marxism are standing in the unemployment line for now well have to pay close attention to the messages that the young people in our lives are absorbing and help them learn to be secure in their faith and cultural identity teach them about their roots and why thats important dont let the tv be your childs babysitter anything goes is not a standard by which to raise our youth,1

courts plans to go to the worlds top court for sports in a bid to force its israeli counterpart to view israeli settlements on the west bank as occupied territory rather than an extension of the jewish state the potential palestinian move follows the palestinian authoritys campaign to isolate israel in international organizations and challenge israels occupation of the west bank in the international criminal court icc using soccer as a testing ground palestines efforts to confront israel in international organizations has produced mixed results while palestine succeeded in joining various international organizations the pfa last year failed to muster sufficient votes to persuade world soccer body fifa to suspend israel the pfa argued that the policies of the israeli government and the israel football association ifa violated fifa rules as well as international law governing the status of occupied territory the pfa has since been unable to push fifa towards any punitive steps against israel instead fifa opted to monitor developments and attempt with little success to negotiate a way out of the impasse palestine is expected to take legal recourse if fifa fails to take more decisive action at its next council meeting in january the pfas focus since failing to get israel suspended has been on banning six clubs that are based in israeli settlements on the west bank from playing in israeli lower divisions fifa rules stipulate that clubs based in a recognized federations territory cannot play in leagues of another soccer association without the permission of the home federation the pfa rejects the notion of granting permission because it believes that it would legitimize israeli settlements and the occupation more swedish soccer player sent off for loud fart during match pfa president jibril rajoub suggested that the pfa would take its case to the court of arbitration for sport cas after a sevenhour meeting earlier this month of a fifa committee headed by tokyo sexwale failed to resolve the issue mr sexwale is scheduled to visit israel later this month for a meeting with israeli sports minister miri regev the fifa council is scheduled to discuss the issue at its next meeting in january the pfa is likely to prepare its case for cas but wait with filing it until after the january meeting israel sees the palestinian demands and threat as strengthening the growing boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds that sees penalization as a means of forcing the jewish state to alter its policies and ultimately withdraw from territory occupied during the middle east war condemnation of the israeli occupation and settlements by the united nations security council constitutes the legal basis for the pfas approach as well as potential challenges in international courts the strength of the palestinian position has been weakened changing persian gulf attitudes towards israel and saudi and united arab emirates pressure on palestine authority president mahmoud abbas persian gulf states despite paying lip service to the palestinian cause have become more public about their informal relations with israel based on common opposition to expanding iranian influence in the region writing in the kingdoms controlled press a prominent saudi journalist went as far as calling for the establishment of diplomatic relations with israel the uae last year agreed to the opening of an israeli diplomatic mission accredited to the abu dhabibased international renewable energy agency rather than the uae government bahrain as part of an agreement to host next years fifa congress has consented to issue visas to representatives of the ifa israeli nationals are barred from travelling to persian gulf countries at the same time saudi arabia and the uae have been pressuring mr abbas to resolve his differences with mohammed dahlan the controversial former abu dhabibased gaza strongman who is an archenemy of the palestinian president mr dahlan is widely seen as a successor to year old mr abbas who would be acceptable to israel israel may be able to count on some degree of tacit persian gulf support within fifa but is likely nonetheless to ultimately have to be seen to be accepting some kind of compromise that throws a bone to the palestinians the palestinians focus on the israeli west bank teams has however raised the bar for israel an agreement between prime minister benyamin netanyahu and former fifa president sepp blatter struck last year addresses many of the pfas grievances but not the issue of six the west bank teams their status goes to the heart of the palestinianisraeli conflict the legal status of territory occupied by israel since under the agreement mr netanyahu proposed to give palestinian players special identity cards and place sports liaison officials at crossings between palestinian areas and those under israeli control in a bid to eliminate obstacles to free movement that complicated the development of palestinian soccer mr netanyahu further suggested to create an escort service that would facilitate players travel between the west bank and gaza that are separated by israeli territory israel initially appeared to live up to its promises by granting for the first time in years a west bank team hebrons al ahli passage to gaza to play a palestine cup final against the strips al shejaia hopes that this signalled a new beginning were however dashed when the pfa cancelled the return match in hebron after israel agreed to grant passage to only of the players who were scheduled to travel implementation of the agreement has since evaporated the pfa by putting the west bank teams at the top of their agenda has made it tougher for fifa and israel to work out a compromise that would not have implications for the future of israelipalestinian peace making israeli is likely to want to avoid subjecting its policies to the scrutiny of an international court yet that may be exactly what would best serve the palestine authoritys overall strategy,0

government did not hack into the dnc and moscow is not feeding john podestas emails to wikileaks for those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory this might be a hard pill to swallow the white house and the hillary clinton campaign are now married to the idea that putin is hacking the us elections in response the president is weighing his options tougher economic sanctions revoking diplomatic status to russian envoys in the us or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyberactivity tools even vp joe biden wants in on the action threatening moscow by sayingwere sending a message we have the capacity to do it it seems that where ever you turn nowadays someone in washington is issuing a threat against russia are usrussian relations really that bad or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the us what was previously a stance reserved for rightwing neoconservative hawks and cold war holdouts has now infected americas leftwing and is a firm plank in the democratic party platform as evidenced by hillary clintons constant antirussian rhetoric throughout this election cycle along with the white house clinton has now transformed the democrats into the vanguard of washingtons new antirussia movement on july th josh rogin from the washington post wrote the clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on russia after trump suggested wednesday that if russia had indeed hacked clintons private email server it should release the emails the clinton campaign sent out its democratic surrogates to bash russia and trump in a manner traditionally reserved for republicans anyone who was paying attention back then knew this russian hack talking point was purely political but then again whos really paying attention these days certainly not the us media you can trace the genesis of the democratic partys hardcore antirussian strategy back to when president vladimir putin made a mild passing remark about donald trumps gop primary success from that point on trumps political opponents saw this as an open target in their words comparing one dictator to another never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points president obama got in on the act intensifying the trumpputin narrative to the level of bromance if youve made a career out of idealizing ronald reagan then where were you when your own partys nominee for president was kissing up to vladimir putin said obama on oct th at a clinton rally in miami backed by the obama white house clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming russia not only for the controversial dnc leaks but also for hacking into us election systems in arizona a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation the medias coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset in a leading news release entitled russian hackers targeted arizona election system we can see how after the cocksure headline the first paragraph would always sound definitive hackers targeted voter registration systems in illinois and arizona and the fbi alerted arizona officials in june that russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state but then by the time you advanced down the story the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty the bureau described the threat as credible and significant an eight on a scale of one to matt roberts a spokesman for arizona secretary of state michele reagan r said monday as a result reagan shut down the states voter registration system for nearly a week and then down to almost nothing it turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system they had however stolen the username and password of a single election official in gila county at no point was any evidence ever given only ambiguous statements like cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a russian governmentdirected hack are american politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their shortterm political ambitions better yet has american political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac translated in french bottom of the bag where politicians in power are so insecure as to makeup and propagate wild international conspiracy theories in the middle a national election cycle its a very depressing prospect and yet this is exactly what we are seeing in this presidential election behind clintons wild hyperbolic rants about the kremlin and wikileaks you will find the white house on october th the obama administration formally accused the russian government of stealing emails from the democratic national committee and other highprofile individuals including hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta giving them to wikileaks soon there was a queue of national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon senator ben sasse ner a member of the homeland security committee spouted out russia must face serious consequences moscow orchestrated these hacks because russian president vladimir putin believes sovietstyle aggression is worth it the united states must upend putins calculus with a strong diplomatic political cyber and economic response according to a washington post report by technology editor ellen nakashima the only evidence that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged russian government hacks provided by a us cyber security company called crowdstrike no actual specifics are given so we are meant to take private firm crowdstrikes word for it image crowdstrike cyber security the posts nakashima then added the administration also blamed moscow for the hack of the democratic congressional campaign committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of democratic lawmakers an online persona calling himself guccifer has claimed responsibility for posting the material those sites and that persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts the joint statement said we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities moscows press secretarys reply this is some sort of nonsense said dmitry peskov despite the constant repetition by democrat media surrogates and as cnns maria cardona said last night no us national intelligence agency has really confirmed that russia was behind the email hacks and still no evidence other than speculative guesswork has been presented likewise us intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that russia did it thus leaving the door open to walkback the accusation at a later date standard washington procedure of ambiguity this little detail doesnt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though it seems that the white house hillary clinton and media operatives like cardona are quite happy living in what john kerry recent dubbed as a parallel universe still during the final presidential debate hillary clinton proudly crowed how us intelligence agencies aka the intelligence community all agreed that russia did it the announcement albeit vague actually originated from the office of the director of national intelligence we have intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the kremlin and they are designed to influence our election said clinton i find that deeply disturbing whats even more disturbing is the fact that clinton is lying in front of a national audience the highest levels of the kremlin here are clintons agencies air force intelligence army intelligence central intelligence agency coast guard intelligence defense intelligence agency energy department homeland security department state department treasury department drug enforcement administration federal bureau of investigation marine corps intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency national reconnaissance office national security agency navy intelligence and the office of the director of national intelligence what does the coast guard intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency or the drug enforcement administration know about john podestas emails answer nothing the exact same thing happened following wikileaks first trove of dnc emails back in july the us government issued a vague accusatory statement but would not actually name the culprit some might call that propaganda in both instances the obama administration refused to present any evidence translated there was no evidence if there had been the white house would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the un over washingtons flagging efforts in syria both obama administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for democrats and journalists working for hopelessly partisan outlets like new york times and cnn none of whom have bothered to press the white house for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the partys decree that russian is hacking the us election process if you actually look at the joint dnidhs statement issued on the matter it contains no definitive statement the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process such activity is not new to moscow the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia for example to influence public opinion there we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities according to nsa intelligence workerturned whistleblower william binney when asked about wikileaks and whether the russians are hacking us elections he concluded that the cyber efforts against the dnc were more likely to be the work of a disgruntled us intelligence worker under partisan pressure from senior democrat senator harry reid the fbi also initiated another investigation into people linked to the trump team with russia reid was unset about the dnc hacks and the podesta emails and demanded the fbi do something about the trump campaign to date the fbi havent come up with anything to be fair hillary would have every reason to believe that the kremlin is behind the hack because her staff read it to her from the campaigns daily intelligence briefings presumably supplied from the us governments much vaunted intelligence community of course thats the same intelligence community that briefed george w bush about saddams nonexistent nuclear weapons program and who also briefed colin powell about iraqs imaginary winnebagos of death aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior doublewide camper vans so of course they would know if putin directed the dnc leaks and podesta email hacks for those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as washington intelligence i can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now no that was iraq that was bush were not like that no this time its different this time we are sure the russians did it in obama claimed that kims notorious bureau hacked into sony pictures this isnt the first time that president obama has cried wolf on a foreign hack and then tried to sell it for political purposes back in december obama claimed that north korea had hacked sony pictures in hollywood pentagoncia media proxy cnn quickly chimed in to support washingtons conspiracy theory floating a colorful story that kim jingun had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called bureau just like with todays russian hack theory no member of the mainstream press dared to question the white houses ridiculous north korean claim and like the russian hack claims the only source cited for sony hack was analysis provided by us firm crowdstrike jumping the shark after their democratic party convention on july th the clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their putin narrative soon after a cadre of top clinton national security surrogates then accused trump of emboldening russia in their evil plot to destabilize and dominate the west tom donilon a former national security adviser then accused russia of interfering with elections all over europe and then accused trump is helping russia directly at that point they were in too deep to turn back the biggest impact of wikileaks shining a spotlight on russias attempt to undermine american democracy and trumps refusal to condemn it httpstcoalzpymbb josh schwerin joshschwerin october clinton spin doctors josh schwerin and michael fallon would stoop even lower by accusing rt of having possession of the podesta emails even before wikileaks did their only evidence seemed to be twitter posts by rt news which clinton held up as proof that the kremlin was frontrunning wikileaks email dumps the clinton braintrust failed to note that the podesta emails were posted on wikileaks own website well before rt news had tweeted about them at that point it became obvious that the clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on we then watched as one rt reporter after another dismantled the clinton campaigns desperate claims it was embarrassing they could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was wikileaks head julian assange who chose the timing of the release of the dnc and podesta emails rather than attack assange himself who happens to be popular with millennials the very group clinton struggles to connect with her operatives opted to target russia and trump instead either way the political strategy here is clear to shoot the messenger the clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rearguard mode because based on the content of both the dnc leaks wikileaks files and project veritas video their own democratic party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from democrats and their mainstream media surrogates none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity the results speak for themselves the initial dnc leak of emails resulted in the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz they revealed the unthinkable the democratic national committee actively worked to undermine the presidential campaign of bernie sanders in favor of the establishment choice in hillary clinton sanders never had a chance honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process while party insiders and clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened to prove this point both president obama and hillary clinton then gave wassermanschultz a glowing endorsement on the way out for the last eight years chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz has had my back this afternoon i called her to let her know that i am grateful said obama not surprisingly clinton thanked wasserman schultz presumably for helping to knock her only competitor sanders out of the democrat primary race i am grateful to debbie for getting the democratic party to this years historic convention in philadelphia and i know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership said clinton the party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it party meltdown wasserman schultzs replacement didnt fair much better dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election but brazile was soon skewered by subsequent wikileaks batches showing how on more than one occasion she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives straight to hillary clinton a march email exchange shows brazile stating that she received a town hall question from roland martin a tv one host who comoderated a march town hall with cnns jake tapper a march email shows that she shared a question with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and communications director jennifer palmieri that was to be asked in a march debate hosted by cnn in flint mich source daily caller braziles audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partys planned sabotage of democrat challenger bernie sanders watch brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here completely corrupt and still brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on fox news last week braziles reputation is so bad now that even cnn has severed ties with her and thats saying a lot in addition it was also revealed how cnns head political commentator gloria borger was named by podesta as one of a shortlist of journalists the clinton campaign would work with to gain favorable coverage youd think that cnn would have dropped borger after this was revealed but no amazingly borger is still leading cnns election coverage clearly cnn cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with hillary clinton and the democratic party everunbiased cnns gloria borger refers to being in gop hell and says shell reach out soon to podesta heartwarming podestaemails pictwittercomcqfdcjq lb hacker owens nubianawakening october worse than watergate perhaps a bigger scandal which the obama white house and clinton campaign operatives would like to bury is the fbis investigation into the clinton foundation yesterday the wall street journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the fbi and the justice department over whether or not to pursue an investigation into clinton issue some investigators grew frustrated viewing fbi leadership as uninterested in probing the charity these people said others involved disagreed sharply defending fbi bosses and saying mr mccabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the justice department and fbi agents pursuing the clinton foundation case it isnt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited but the internal debates about the clinton foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president theres more it was also revealed last week how jill mccabe the wife of fbi deputy director andrew mccabe received in campaign funds in late for her virginia state senate run this unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by virginia govterry mcauliffe a clinton foundation board member after the funds were donated andrew mccabe was then put in charge of the clinton email case in normal times this one scandal would be bigger than watergate but these are not normal times so why is washington going all out to deflect to russia and coverup the clinton scandals and the wikileaks document dumps one reason is because the clinton email issue goes all the way to the top to the president himself what wire reported on oct st is how president obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of hillarys unauthorized private server obama told cbs news on march that he only found out about clintons server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports the presidents lie was confirmed when newly released fbi documents showed that obama used a pseudonym bobamaameritechnet when communicating with thensecretary of state hillary clinton by email and at least one of those emails ended up on clintons private email server so not only did obama lie on national tv but he also broke strict white house security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails off grid with hillary clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system who knows why he did it sure hes not the first us president to lie but like richard nixon and bill clinton obama just joined that exclusive liars club caught out lying to the american people on top of this any communications made by the president of the united states are de facto labeled as born classified the same goes for any state department communications with other foreign ministers coverup john podesta and huma abedin on the hillary campaign jet image abc news it should be well known by now after watching both attorney generals eric holder and loretta lynch in action that the obama justice department doj is one of the most politicized in history bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the hillary email case on friday fbi director james comey set the election alight after announcing that the fbi would be reopening the clinton email case currently examining emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former us congressman anthony weiner estranged husband of top clinton aid and longtime confidant huma abedin who was snared in a sexting scandal allegedly involving a underaged female so which doj person is in charge of this investigation none other than assistant attorney general peter j kadzik who is kadzik zero hedge reports oh yes recall our post from last week clinton campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillarys benghazi hearing in which we reported that john podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked doj officials the very day after hillary clintons benghazi testimony it was peter kadzik oh and if that wasnt good enough kadzik was also podestas lawyer back in when ken starr was investigating podesta over his role in helping bill clinton internmistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations the two were described as best friends fox news confirms fantastic lawyer kept me out of jail podesta wrote on sept to obama aide cassandra butts according to emails hacked from podestas gmail account and posted by wikileaks to call the clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement and on the whole americans are sick of it russia the party scapegoat former democratic party leader howard dean was so incensed about the fbi reopening the case he accused the fbi director of being in league with russia tweeting ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin howard dean govhowarddean october another veteran party operative and lifetime clinton defender james carville was so upset by the fbi announcement that he accused the kgb working with republicans to hijack the election during his wild rant on msnbc i think this an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for comey thats what i think said carville maybe someone can remind carville that there is no kgb and that the soviet union actually dissolved in these are just a few scandals surrounding the democratic party and the clinton campaign along with the many exposés revealed through wikileaks and the podesta email batches those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence unlike the russians hacking the dnc and john podesta and passing those to wikileaks suffice to say the democratic party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning wikileaks material and also blame donald trump in the process it should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised hillary clinton over the finish line on november th the washington establishment has concocted the story that putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the us theyve tried to lay this at the feet of donald trump who obama and clinton claim has some secret special relationship with vladimir putin the liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point and antirussian war hawks on the republican side love it too for the white house and the clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep a perfect double entendre the geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold first this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against russia secondly the us could continue to lean on russia in the un over syria previously wire reported how washingtons state dept and un delegations led by the dynamic trio of john kerry samantha power and john kirby already lied when levelling charges against russia for war crimes in aleppo and again while accusing russia and syria of conducting an airstrike on a un aid convoy in syria as we have already shown that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of usbacked rebels al nusra front or nour aldin alzenki with so much at stake geopolitically why would washington lie about a potential world war iii trigger event if they are prepared to lie about this what else are they prepared to lie about the demonization of all things russian has definitely accelerated since late when the us engineered a coup detat in kiev ukraine ever since that its been a goto talking point for ginningup and new transaltlantic arms race as with republican war hawks and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection like clinton and the democrats when the new year rang in the newly appointed head of the us broadcasting board of governors andrew lack announced the new challenges facing americas own staterun media arm that includes us overseas propaganda assets including voice of america radio free europeradio liberty the middle east broadcasting networks and radio free asia lack said we are facing a number of challenges from entities like russia today which is out there pushing a point of view the islamic state in the middle east and groups like boko haram he was forced to resign shortly after that whats clear is that when it comes to all things russian there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this us administration the list is too long to chronicle here although russianbacked rebles shootting down mh and assad regime sarin attack in damascus in certainly comes to mind that said its hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the russia government a world nuclear power and member of the unsc of hacking into the us electoral process when you examine history however what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the us government and the cia have altered and flipped foreign elections throughout history the attempted assassination of over foreign leaders knowing all this one might find it hard to take seriously washingtons claims that putin and trump are trying manipulate the election on oct russian foreign minister sergei lavrov laid it all on the table we have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive russophobia that now lies at the heart of us policy towards russia its not just a rhetorical russophobia but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security selfserving career political operatives in washington are playing a dangerous game history will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the obamaclinton era knowing what we now know about the nsa and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone anywhere if washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from maybe they could start there far be it from anyone in washington or the media to ever adopt

lie about the weather given out by the government and the loss of three radio links at the same time while the plane was still miles from the crash site signs the plane was sabotaged first off the claims made in both time and newsweek that ron browns plane crashed in the worst storm in a decade are directly contradicted by the weather report issued by the dubrovnik airport tower adjacent to the crash site the storm simply did not exist while the plane carrying ron brown and his party was still miles from the crash site mile in the air and on the normal approach path three radio based links with three separate propagation paths all failed at the same time according to the aviation week space technology article the dubrovnik tower lost voice radio contact at the same time the aircraft vanished from the screens of the approach radar at split and an awacs lets look at the split radar first the split radar watches the approach to dubrovnik airport which is where the ron brown aircraft was when it dropped off of the radar screen contrary to some silly claims made in this newsgroup before the plane was not flying in the mountains it was out over the water with open space all around the radar at split routinely tracks aircraft through that airspace without problem if it were normal for the split radar to lose traffic at that point on the approach path nobody would have mentioned it because it would be normal and expected behavior nothing unusual about it that comment was made about the target dropping off of the split radar establishes that it was an unusual event the split radar like all atc radar tracks primarily by aircraft transponder so when the split radar lost track of the ron brown aircraft what was lost was the transponder return as the aircraft was still on the approach path although just starting to veer slightly left now lets look at the awacs the awacs system is designed to track nontranspondered targets radar hits are placed in a computer system that keeps a list and tries to match the returns from the present radar sweep to the returns from the previous sweeps in order to generate meaningful target tracking data for the operators and weapons management systems part of that process involves target to target comparisons to make certain that what the computer thinks is target xyz this sweep is the same target it thought was xyz last sweep the total workload on the computer is a power function of the total number of nontranspondered targets being carried in the target list if a target has a transponder the awacs will track the target using the transponder return because not only is less computer power needed for a transpondered target but the workload for nontranspondered targets is reduced how do we know that the awacs was tracking the ron brown plane via transponder because the awacs lost its track at the same time that the split radar lost its transponder return had the awacs been tracking the ron brown plane via skinpaint there is no reason for it to lose track of the aircraft at the same time that split did had the awacs not reported losing contact we could surmise that either the awacs was tracking on skin paint or the split radar suffered a momentary failure but this was not the case it is also true that the awacs could have immediately reacquired the ron brown aircraft on skin paint and its not known for a fact that the computers did not add it as a nontranspondered target but the awacs was there to watch bosnia not the dubrovnik airport the two radar tracks propagating along two different paths come together at only one common point where a single failure could make the aircraft vanish from both split and the awacs and that is the radar transponder in the ron brown aircraft a failure of the transponder is the only explanation for the ron brown plane vanishing from two different radar screens at the same time while still miles from the crash site and mile above the adriatic sea at the same time that the aircraft vanished from the radars at split and the awacs the dubrovnik tower reported it lost voice radio contact with the aircraft this is a third distinct propagation path from the awacs and split in fact its direct line of sight from the dubrovnik tower to the location on the approach path where radio contact was lost there are no intervening geological features to block the radio signal the dubrovnik tower continued to communicate with other aircraft in the area so the radios in the tower were not at fault the data reported in the aviation week space technology article shows evidence that two sperate systems on board the ron brown aircraft failed at the same time the cockpit radios and the radar transponder the radios and radar transponders come together at only one common point where a single failure could make the aircraft vanish from both split and the awacs and lose voice radio contact with the dubrovnik tower and that is is the electrical system failed in mid air while still miles from the crash site and mile above the adriatic sea on the approach path how do we know the problem extended beyond the electrical system simple prior to the loss of radio the flight crew had acknowledged receiving a weather report they knew there was clear air beneath them there is only one reason for the flight crew suddenly without any instruments at all not to descend out of a cloud layer into the clear air they knew was below them and thats if the event that severed the electrical cables also severed the flight control cables which occupy the same midline conduit in the possible trigger given the unscheduled nature of the trip a timer would be useless to pinpoint the exact geographic location of the detonation however knowing the approach pattern into the airport a location over the adriatic can be selected by the altitude of the aircraft along the glide slope the simplest explanation which fits the twin wreckage sites and the early news reports of a water crash is that of an altitude triggered bomb placed on the aircraft prior to departure as the aircraft climbs above a certain altitude the device is armed as the aircraft descends through the trigger altitude say feet the device detonates why did the plane make it to shore as the reports have pointed out the weather was not ideal the pilot even with the best navigation aids in the world would be fully justified in delaying his descent in order to stay in clear air as long as possible then ducking quickly down through the clouds to find the airfield this means that the altitude triggered bomb would have detonated far closer to land than expected with the result that portions of the wreckage came on shore the mile spread between wreckage sites indicates an airborne event which blew part of the aircraft off the same mile distance coupled with the shallow impact angle suggests that the aircraft was still flyable and that the pilot may have been trying to make it to the airfield when the crash into the hill occurred was thermite used its impossible to state based on the information available to the public but thermite is a definite possibility it can be made using available materials and will not show up on the various detectors which would sense chemical explosives such as c thermite when ignited burns at half the temperature of the surface of the sun and would burn through the aluminum of an aircraft with ease packed in a suitcase near the top of the baggage compartment of the converted it would be in an ideal location to sever the control linkages and to short out the planes electrical system as well as burning a hole through the skin dumping debris into the ocean how bad was the weather there were several reports in the media that dubrovnik was in the grip of the worst storm of the decade this is not true as can be seen by the weather information contained in the aviation week article and the first news articles from reuters the weather was not exceptionally bad indeed the wind conditions were excellent providing a knot head wind with no cross component at the runway perfect landing conditions below the overcast at feet

conference of donor nations was scheduled for next week in belgium washington april upi president clinton awaiting final word wednesday on the fate of his friend and political ally commerce secretary ron brown made emotional visits to browns home and the federal department where he spoke to distraught federal workers after hearing mid morning that the military plane carrying brown had crashed near the adriatic coast in croatia clinton wasted little time in sharing his grief and trying to console the brown family friends and workers the browns have a son michael and a daughter tracey a family spokesman said the browns were still holding out hope the president and first lady hillary rodham clinton dressed in dark suits and wearing solemn faces spent nearly an hour at browns washington home where he lived with his wife alma couriers also arrived with flowers from wellwishers and the secret service checked each bunch before allowing them into the townhouse the clintons emerged from the home located in the affluent secluded chatworth neighborhood of washington with their heads down and the first lady appearing to choke back tears brown was head of the democratic national committee when clinton was the partys presidential nominee in and he was greatly credited with playing a key role in putting a democrat in the white house after the visit with the family the clintons immediately headed across town to commerce department headquarters where the president addressed employees who packed the auditorium clinton told the gathering that he his wife and other administration officials came to be with the employees of the commerce department at this very difficult hour the plane carrying secretary brown and his delegation including a number of your colleagues business leaders and leaders of the united states military went down today near dubrovnik croatia clinton told the workers we do not know for sure what happened there clinton said he asked browns wife what he should tell the department workers she said tell them ron was proud of them that he liked them that he believed in them and that he fought for the commerce department and tell them that youre going to do that now clinton said winning sustained applause from the crowd many of the hundreds of department employees were visibly shaken at the news with many crying and others holding and consoling one another also present at the commerce department when clinton spoke were several cabinet secretaries including attorney general janet reno agriculture secretary dan glickman housing and urban development secretary henry cisneros health and human services secretary donna shalala education secretary richard riley and interior secretary bruce babbitt vice president al gore and the first lady also joined clinton at the commerce department earlier sen ted kennedy dmass visited the brown family to express his condolences brown was kennedys chief of staff before going to the urban league and democratic national committee clinton named him commerce secretary in another visitor was vernon jordan former head of the urban league and now a highpowered washington lawyer and unofficial adviser to clinton a us air force t which is the military equivalent of a bowing carrying brown and his entourage from tuzla to dubrovnik crashed into a mountain near the adriatic sea coast but officials were writing off the possibility of foul play there hasnt been any report over here indicating anything hostile but again we cant confirm that white house spokesman mike mccurry said republicans in congress have been working to dismantle the commerce department although a gop aide said wednesday the effort may be scrapped following the crash of browns plane washington reuter president clintons wife hillary and daughter chelsea flew on the same plane last week that crashed in croatia with commerce secretary ron brown aboard us air force sources said wednesday a military version of the widely used boeing passenger jet flew mrs clinton and her yearold daughter from the turkish capital of ankara to the ancient biblical city of ephesus and on to istanbul last wednesday the ta plane with a tail number of was based at the us air base at ramstein germany the sources said mrs clinton used it rather than the boeing assigned to her for a weeklong goodwill tour of southern europe because of the short runway at ephesus the same plane was used to ferry defense secretary william perry in and out of bosnia last week mrs clinton also visited the yugoslav region during her trip but used a giant c military cargo jet for that leg of her journey update,1

what he wanted russia to become and sometimes in history personality matters more than those vague historical forces that professional historians like to imagine as controlling the destinies of men russia in his day was still halfbarbarous to rule her he had to be an absolute monarch and never for a moment doubted his right to be so his personal habits say much about him he had little need for sleep regularly working for fourteen hours or more per day alcohol was considered then as now an acceptable escape from the drudgery of rule but he knew when to limit his intake and forbade his ministers from excessive consumption his sexual appetites were as normal as any mans but he showed little interest in the kind of conspicuous indulgence that characterized most of his contemporaries in western europe he did make a point of choosing mistresses of lowly origin rather than from titled families he had no desire for intellectual competition in the bedroom when frederick ii of denmark teased him about the type of women he chose his response was brother my women do not cost me much but yours cost you thousands of crowns which might be better spent elsewhere he chose to spend most of his time in the city that bore his name st petersburg he liked maritime affairs and wanted to be near the sea he disliked the atmosphere of moscow with its abundance of clergy and freezing winters it was the army that first felt the effect of his modernization programs peter introduced conscription a professional officer class and defined periods of service his naval program was less effective and most of the vessels built during his reign were not of high quality he realized that he would never be able to make russia into a great power unless he changed the mentality and outlook of the people and like many rulers before and after him he underestimated just how difficult this task would prove to be after his death many of his reforms were permitted to wither on the vine but at least some tentative first steps had been made that future monarchs might draw inspiration from by imperial decree he banished beards in an exception was made for the orthodox patriarch this was a shocking step in a country where whiskers had become a symbol of piety and fidelity those who insisted on keeping them could do so by paying an incomeadjusted annual tax we are told that some distraught peasants obsessively saved their shaved facial hair lest they incur some disfavor from the saints but there was method to peters apparent madness he understood that appearance and thought are connected and that if a man wished to change one he had to change the other in peter decreed that all royal officials had to adopt westernstyle clothing trousers and cloaks were acceptable caftans or overly oriental garb was not like kemal ataturk two centuries later he had no patience for backsliders or protesters whom he swept aside ruthlessly in social relations he ended for good the traditional practice of secluding women from public intercourse with men a habit that had probably been an inheritance from the mongols these reforms gained peter some bitter enemies among the clergy for centuries the russian ecclesiastic establishment had held a near monopoly on education and rural social life peters reforms threatened to erode this base and they saw in him an implacable enemy of traditional belief they also suspected him of having had too much contact with western europeans a fact thatit seemed to themmade him nearly an atheist peter did not help matters by openly mocking their rituals and folkways as he saw matters it was his responsibility to bring russia up to par with the other advanced nations of the day and resistance from obscurantist clerics could not be tolerated peter solved this problem for a time by making himself the head of the orthodox church in when patriarch adrian died he did not appoint a successor and went one step further in by abolishing the title of patriarch altogether in its place he formed a council of clerics that he himself would appoint with this measure the church effectively became an arm of the state ecclesiastical grumbling was audible but peter wisely refused to venture into disputes with the priests over religious doctrine he cared about power not theology slowly he made progress in industrialization this frankly could only be done with dictatorial power and to this end he reorganized the traditional russian boyar system in place of the old aristocracy a new one arose that was based on military and civil function his rule saw some success in mining and textile work when peter died in russia was exporting iron and statesponsored factories made modest gains in cloth manufacture protective tariffs were used to shelter the new industries from suffocating foreign competitionto pay for all this peter unashamedly taxed everyone in his realm to the limits of their tolerance state tax revenues rose from million rubles in to million in the majority of this revenue went to the military a russian boyar ambitious plans existed for education too peter ordered the old slavonic alphabet used by the church to be replaced by a new system based on greek letters he imported printing presses founded institutes and organized professional associations to spread the ideas that were current at the time in western europe what was the net result of all this effort the picture was a mixed one reformers are not usually popular as by their very nature they are required to focus attentions in different directions men and horses do not appreciate new stirrups the peasantryalready used to a harsh existencefound themselves taxed to exhaustion moscow became filled with paupers who alternated between banditry and begging the nobles hated him with the same ferocity as the french nobles hated richelieu and for the very same reason because he forced them to serve the nation rather than each other as his unpopularity grew peter resorted more and more to the whip and the dungeon to implement his designs perhaps there was no other way but at the very least his example pointed the way for future authoritarian leaders who would drag russia kicking and screaming into the modern era some of his achievements were lasting and significant and some were not in history even great men must contend with the limitations of their era and try to balance their own vision with the possibilities granted them by circumstance it is on this precarious tightrope that all great men walk read more more countries to emigrate to if the west collapses,1

to power earlier this year with both irony and hypocrisy she has not only illegally declared herself leader of the southeast asian state in contravention of its constitution she has also embarked on an ironfisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with during elections earlier this year myanmars constitution prevented suu kyi from holding the nations highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas her status of having been married to a foreign and her childrens dual citizenship instead of adhering to the law her party once in power simply contrived an entirely new post for her state counsellor of myanmar which makes her the defacto leader of myanmar canadas the globe and mail in an article titled stéphane dion says aung san suu kyi is the de facto leader of myanmar would note that canadas government recognized this legal sidestepping stating dion called suu kyi now myanmars foreign minister the de facto national leader of her country because they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody whos not of the country you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state suu kyi the internationally recognized democracy advocate is barred from becoming president because her late husband was british as are her two sons the rule was crafted during myanmars decades of military rule which suu kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall in essence she is unelected and illegally holding power for a woman whos western backers particularly in the united states and united kingdom have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law she and her partys first act upon taking power was trampling both the inhumane humanitarian another myth built up around nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi by the west has been her advocacy for human rights her advocacy for human rights however appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned for groups beyond this selfserving political protection and particularly regarding her political opponents she and her ndl are just as eager to jail crush or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been in addition to escalating violence targeting the nations rohingyas population several activists online have been sent to jail for insulting the ruling government and westernbacked media fronts and organizations myanmars eleven media group emg in its article facebook offender brought to court for insulting suu kyi attempted to distance what suu kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now a simple matter of enforcing the law it would state a facebook user named zaw zaw aka nga pha was brought to the north dagon township court on october to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about state counsellor aung san suu kyi he has been charged under section d of the telecommunications law hes being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the state counsellor posted on facebook said plaintiff nay myo kyaw a yearold resident of north okkalapa township around people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the network of supporters of the rule of law they shouted you deserved it for insulting a good person the article also admits the myawady township court sentenced aung win hlaing aka a nyar thar the first man to be prosecuted under the current government for defamatory posts on facebook about president htin kyaw to nine months in jail after he was convicted under section d of the telecommunications law aung myint tun aka ko pho htaung a member of the national league for democracy is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter another man named yar pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake facebook account under the name of nay myo wai the chairman of peace and diversity party hla phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on facebook about the commanderinchief emg ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous militaryled government by reporters without borders would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of myanmars laws to silence its own critics claiming eleven media group emg also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on facebook against the group though emg lodged complaints against film director mike tee who is the owner of a facebook account named than tun zaw and another facebook user named myat maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff the legal process has yet to begin emg lodged the complaints on january and march this year one would expect such a tidal wave of abuse as defined by the west in regards to media governance and censorship around the world to be met with sweeping condemnation from the wests various human rights advocacy organizations including human rights watch amnesty international and a no doubt embarrassed reporters without borders yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling taking over where accused dictators left off the wests champions of democracy rule of law and human rights in myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where suu kyi and her ndl party had claimed the militaryled government left off and despite the overt nature of suu kyis breaches of western standards of democracy and human rights the us is on track to lift all sanctions from myanmar as suu kyi and her government open the nation its people and its resources to exploitation by western corporations the overt nature of both the wests and suu kyis hypocrisy illustrates that democracy rule of law and human rights are merely facades behind which the west and its proxies wield their power hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them and in reality such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the western governments supporting the current regime in myanmar their fauxnongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime and proxies like suu kyi and her ndl themselves international audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the west attempts to overturn other governments in southeast asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric supporting supposed prodemocracy and prohuman rights advocates

target on my recent visit to stockholm for the identitarian conference some swedes and i compared notes on whose country was the most crazyliberal and antiwhite the swedes pointed to a short video recently released by an ngo that said swedes should integrate into the culture of thirdworld immigrants to form a new country my swedish colleagues agreed with french author renaud camus writing on free west media he argues that whereas white populations everywhere seem determined to be replaced by thirdworlders the case of sweden is even more tragic more extreme more insane nowhere else do a people and a nation show a stronger will to suicide but i believe south africa is worse we have actual laws regulations and policies that require corporations universities and sports bodies to replace whites our country has become the world champion of antiwhite antiwestern ideology together with our northern neighbor zimbabwe we are to multiculturalism what pol pots shortlived democratic kampuchea was to communism its most extreme expression pol pot waged genocide against the entire middle class of cambodia in order to start a new society south africas ruling elite also wants a new society that will be cleansed of western influences and even the white race as robert mugabe put it during his famous visit to soweto i dont want to see a white face the current upheavals at our universitiesknown absurdly as the fallist movementhave been widely reported enraged black students egged on by understanding whites have demanded that one thing after another must fall each accompanied by its own hashtag first it was rhodesmustfall the statue of cecil rhodes at the university of cape town then afrikaansmustfall blacks want to eliminate afrikaans as a language of university instruction followed by feesmustfall they want tuition fees abolished and now sciencemustfall in a video that has had nearly a million views a female black student at the university of cape town called for science to be scrapped saying if i personally were committed to decolonization science as a whole is a product of western modernity and the whole thing should be scratched off so if you want practical solutions to how to decolonize science we have to restart science fromi dont knowfrom an african perspective from our perspective from how weve experienced science for instance i have a question for all the science people there is a place in kzn called umhlabuyalingana they believe that through the magic the black magicyou call it black magic they call it witchcraftyou are able to send lightening to strike someone can you explain that scientifically because its something that happens the initial reaction was widespread ridicule from ordinary whites but i knew that her dismissal of western science was not taking place in a vacuum and was connected with the culturalmarxist ideas swirling through most western universities after all herbert marcuse one of the founders of cultural marxism wrote this in an essay on liberation in at the height of us student radicalism this is the hippie subculture tripgrasspotacid and so on but a far more subversive universe of discourse announces itself in the language of black militants here is a systematic linguistic rebellion which smashes the ideological context in which the words are employed and defined and places them into the opposite contextnegation of the established one thus the blacks take over some of the most sublime and sublimated concepts of western civilization desublimate and redefine them p needless to say marcuse approved of the black take over and if he were alive today he would surely applaud what is happening in south africa not only are blacks taking over western concepts and changing them into their opposites they are taking over our institutions as well in universities and the mainstream media there was actually praising this young fallist i was only slightly surprised to read a piece in afrikaans entitled sciencemustfall nie so belaglik soos dit mag klink sciencemustfall not so ridiculous as it sounds it was written by liezel de lange the managing director of our sunday newspaper rapport which once supported apartheid and segregation miss de lange first confessed ignorance because she attended the university of pretoria in the days when it still taught western ideas and culture she laments that when she studied english literature almost all our prescribed works were from britain and ireland as well as the usa i have to give my lecturers at the time credit for assigning readings from wole soyinka chinua achebe and ngugi wa thiongo most westerners no doubt have deficient educations because they have not been taught ngugi wa thiongo although liezel de lange did not exactly endorse the sciencemustfall idea in defense of the young fallist she evoked the mythical medieval african university of timbuktu as evidence that africas vast contributions to world learning are being ignored in fact timbuktu was a center for islamic and tuareg schools not a hub of forgotten african or black science nor are africans themselves united in wanting to preserve what is left of the medieval african university recent al qaeda activity in the region has been so destructive that the new yorker recently ran a story called has the great library of timbuktu been lost i asked liezel de lange on twitter whether she was an afrocentrist but she evaded the question answering that she merely posits that not all knowledge wisdom and insight come from the west its hard to disagree with that miss de langes column was just a watereddown version of a more radical piece she had read on the leftwing website the daily maverick by joel modiri called in the fall decolonisation and the rejuvenation of the academic project in south africa mr modiri is a black academic at unisa university of south africa which has been racially transformedmeaning that whites have been all but banished it is africas largest correspondence university naturally founded by south african whites mr modiri explained that her the fallists error proves her point he decried the presentation of knowledge by south african universities as predominantly the product of the west and the failure to recognize that some of the major scientific disciplines medicine physics astronomy mathematics among others have deep heritages in africa china and india in other words she is a victim of the false eurocentric view that science is western to begin with some american blacks have long maintained that the west stole its knowledge from africa they never explain how science could be stolen from one people by another leaving no trace behind knowledge is not like the mona lisa which cannot exist in more than one place so it is strange that the wise africans who conceived of science and culture no longer possessed it once it was stolen from them but we have to remember samuel huntingtons dictum in his book the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order culture follows power if anything this is what the rest of the world might learn from south africa whoever dominates politically will impose his culture and beliefs even if they are more primitive than those it replaces once the scientist has been politically and culturally subjugated he may have to bow down to the witchdoctor unfortunately it is not only pseudointellectual blacks such as mr modiri who hate the west one of the most europhobic statements in support of the black uct student came from stuart theobald a whiteliberal english south african academic who divides his time between london and johannesburg in the same rapport that liezel de lange edits mr theobald writes of the need to decolonize science because it has been used to justify racism and to support biological racism he continues we are kidding ourselves if we pretend that colonial attitudes are not still affecting the way science works today this is why a deliberate effort to decolonise science is valuable and south african universities have the opportunity to lead the charge he adds that we need a new paradigm in science that recognises the racism embedded in much of scientific practice and methodology and that a postcolonial science that is shorn of the straitjacket of past thinking will solve problems that now baffle us he notes the fuss made over the fallist students comments and then asks but when you see the entanglement of racism and science can you blame her are south african blacks and white liberals ready to ditch science in favor of the dark arts as harry potter would say if they have tooth aches or appendicitis i suspect they will submit to the humiliation of colonial science rather than look for a cure in the traditional rituals and voodoo of africa,0

him was no longer around to offer insights on family history correct any accounts that might appear or write one of his own in the dreams from my father gramps might say that a kenyan foreign student looks a lot like nat king cole actually gramps might not the kenyan student barack h obama bears little resemblance to cole who passed away in but enjoyed a revival in the s through daughter natalies unforgettable album the narrator of dreams from my father invokes a stubborn desire to protect myself from scrutiny and he doesnt fault people their suspicions if they fail to take him at face value his elusive father is a prop in someone elses narrative and an image i could alter on a whim or ignore when convenient the narrative itself is a myth a tale and a useful fiction dreams from my father

is the presidents biological father malik obama son of the kenyan barack h obama sees a strong physical resemblance that also holds true on the policy side professor kengor found remarkable similarities between the writings of davis and the policies of president barack obama the kenyan barack obama though a man of the left was not a prosoviet communist had he been prosoviet he would have attended patrice lumumba university in moscow indeed obama warned his fellow kenyans about soviet meddling in africa the kenyan obama would have found strange the presidents cancelation of missile defense for european allies an outspoken man he would not have supported the kind of hightech harassment sharyl attkisson described in stonewalled my fight for truth against the forces of obstruction intimidation and harassment in obamas washington the kenyan barack h obama had issues with strongman types such as jomo kenyatta who ruled kenya from until his death in in keeping with his country and

manager frantically phoning the police get here in a hurry we got niggers at our counters and our washrooms are loaded with fairies and lesbians or perhaps there might have been a joint march on washington waving banners blacks and homos arise that and davis pornographic novel sex rebel black might explain the presidents stubborn desire to protect himself from scrutiny it could also have something do with what the narrator calls the less flattering aspects of my fathers character in dreams from my father the kenyan is raised a muslim but in the audacity of hope he is a confirmed atheist thinking religion to be so much superstition like the mumbojumbo of witch doctors that he had witnessed in the kenyan villages of his youth in audacity the narrator explains that he went to a predominantly muslim school in indonesia he does not indicate whether atheists lutherans jews or buddhists also attended the school registration records were supposedly destroyed by flooding the predominantly muslim school also emerges in believer but axelrod does not indicate if students of other faiths attended frank ann dunham stanley dunham and even the kenyan barack obama are missing from this account but it proves enlightening in other ways in a brian williams of msnbc asked presidential candidates what steps they would take in the event of a simultaneous terror attack on major american cities as axelrod explains obama neglected to include that he would pursue the perpetrators hillary clinton did likewise in passing off what she privately regarded as a terrorist attack on the us compound in benghazi as a spontaneous protest over a video like the president clinton has always shown a stubborn desire to protect herself from scrutiny with bleachbit hammers and lies hillary and her handlers did their best to make more than emails disappear the contents remain something of a mystery just as mysteries linger about the president and his background on the other hand by now some things are perfectly clear the potus and former flotus both decline to identify islamic terrorism both are shrinkwrapped in statist superstition and both lie with the greatest of ease on these counts like the critters in orwells animal farm one can find it impossible to say which was which back in july the party faithful were chanting four more years during the presidents speech at the

but the presstitutes have done the next best thing for hillary they have made comey the issue not hillary according to us senator harry reid and the presstitutes we dont need to worry about hillarys crimes after all she is only a political woman feathering her nest just as political men have done for ages why all this misogynist talk about hillary the presstitutes cry is that comeys alleged crime is far more important this womanhating republican violated the hatch act by telling congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened a very strange interpretation of the hatch act during an election it is ok to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not ok to say that a candidate is under investigation in july comey violated the hatch act when he on orders from the corrupt obama attorney general announced hillary clean in so doing comey used the prestige of federal clearance of hillarys violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls actually hillarys standing in the polls is based on the pollsters overweighting hillary supporters in the polls it is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions if you look at the crowds attending the two candidates public appearances it is clear that the american people prefer donald trump who is opposed to war with russia and china war with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election hillarys problem has the ruling american oligarchy for which hillary is the total servant concerned what are they going to do about trump if he wins will his fate be the same as john f kennedy robert kennedy martin luther king george wallace time will tell or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the oligarchy got rid of dominique strausskahn all of the american and western feminists progressives and leftwing remnant fell for the obvious frameup of strausskahn after strausskahn was blocked from the presidency of france and resigned as director of the imf the new york authorities had to drop all charges against strausskahn but washington succeeded in removing strausskahn as a challenge to its french vassal sarkozy this is how the american oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests the corrupt selfserving oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities and of course through the presstitutes americans minds the oligarchs are now hardpressed to rescue hillary as us president so lets see if the oligarchs can once again deceive the american people while we wait lets concern ourselves with another important issue the clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the th century allowed a small handful of megacorporations to consolidate the us media in a few hands this vast increase in the power of the oligarchy was accomplished despite us antitrust law the media mergers destroyed the american tradition of a dispersed and independent media but really what does federal law mean to the one percent nothing whatsoever the one percents power makes them immune to law hillarys crimes might cost her the election but she wont go to jail not content with control of the us media the oligarchy wants more concentration and more control looks like they will be getting it thanks to the corrupt us government the federal trade commission is supposed to enforce us antitrust law instead the federal agency routinely violates us antitrust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law we now have banks too big to fail unregulated internet monopoly and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media not so long ago there was a field of economics known as antitrust phd candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power i assume that this field of economics like the america of my youth no longer exists in the article below rahul manchanda explains that yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another

for you in your research first this but voices actual voices in your head is always mental illness sorry maybe a stress reaction not to be judgmental happens to the best and such just really not what i am trying to convey here though i believe you are quite intelligent i dont think you are qualified exactly to make that wholesale definitive judgement you even contradict that by referencing dr vinods channeling of the nine in channeling by definition from dictionarycom means in one sense the practice of professedly entering a meditative or trancelike state in order to convey messages from a spiritual guide surely this process would involve the sensory structure of hearing i dont wish to debate voice to skull tech with you because i dont sense this is really what your thread is about but there have been lawsuits waged and won over such technology being used to harass people who dont test as schizophrenic or any other dsm related diagnosis that would explain auditory hallucinations indicating mental illness now thats not to say that anyone hearing voices is being technologically harassed but saying definitively its always mental illness does a disservice to the search for knowledge and stopping such technology being used on people link to lawsuit psychotronic weaponsspace preservation acthouse resolution bill brain manipulation from a distance last year in october the congressman dennis j kucinich introduced in the american congress a bill obliging the american president to get engaged in the negotiations aimed at the ban of space based weapons in this bill the definition of a weapon system includes any other unacknowledged or as yet undeveloped means inflicting death or injury on or damaging or destroying a person or the biological life bodily health mental health or physical and economic wellbeing of a person through the use of landbased seabased or spacebased systems using radiation electromagnetic psychotronic sonic laser or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations or the purpose of information war mood management or mind control of such persons or populations as in all legislative acts quoted in this article the bill counts with sound light or electromagnetic stimulation of human brain psychotronic weapons remain at least for a layman uninformed of secret military research in the sphere of science fiction since so far none of the published scientific experiments was presented in the way which would allow for its replication that it is feasible to manipulate human behavior with the use of subliminal either sound or visual messages is now generally known this is why in most of the countries the use of such technologies without consent of the user is banned devices using light for the stimulation of the brain show another way how the light flashing in certain frequencies could be used for the manipulation of human psychic life as for the sound a report on the device transmitting a beam of sound waves which can hear only persons at whom the beam of sound waves is targeted appeared last year in the world newspapers the beam is formed by a combination of sound and ultrasound waves which causes that a person targeted by this beam hears the sound inside of his head such a perception could easily convince the human being that it is mentally ill the acts presented in this article suggest that with the development of technology and knowledge of the functioning of human brain new ways of manipulation of human mind keep emerging one of them seems to be the electromagnetic energy though in the open scientific literature only some experiments were published supporting this assumption already in in the ussr after successful testing with military unit in novosibirsk the installation radioson radiosleep was registered with the government committee on the matters of inventions and discoveries of the ussr described as a method of induction of sleep by means of radio waves dear senatorattorney letter included we seek your offices assistance in initiating hearings and a factfinding congressional inquiry into the government agencies andor private companies that are targeting citizens many citizens are desperate to be freed from the disturbing intrusive and oppressive targeting evidence supports the conclusion that weapons exist that could be used against individuals based on us patent and trademark office filings public releases by agencies and other technologies that indicate the level of technological sophistication the weapons are believed to be based on electromagnetism microwaves sonic waves lasers and other types of directed energy and were characterized as psychotronic in rep dennis kucinichs draft of house resolution the space preservation act of furthermore it is undeniable that government agencies have tested citizens without permission in the past for example the cias human experimentation discussed in orlikow v us fsupp ddc secretly administered lysergic acid diethylamide discussed in united states v stanley us and military chemical experimentation as discussed in congressional committee report d congress d session s prt dec lastly the sheer numbers of people complaining of being targeted including people with postgraduate degrees and a lifetime of achievements and the similarities in symptoms tend to outweigh a dismissive response based on charges of anecdotal evidence or group paranoia there is a certain risk of sounding too conspiratorial however common denominators such as physical symptoms and medical reports surveillance scenarios harassment techniques and more can be readily established i highly recommend reading in full the details of this lawsuit containing a great deal of verifiable information the military has admitted for some time to having at the least a non lethal lol weapon called active denial but this rabbit hole goes much much deeper having said all that as ive said before in one of your threads i think it wise to consider that its not just one thing or another its many things there could be aliens for instance and then there could be milabs leaving the person with the memory of an alien abduction rather than their being used for human experimentation which is supposed to be against our constitution and most certainly against our human rights and then people can also suffer from temporal lobe seizure like hallucinations but one must also remember that these can most certainly be induced artificially as well in short i think your rabbit hole is only

the key to life is for men to honour their primal nature learn more about his views at theprimalmalecom you can also follow him on twitter november mind we modern men need to constantly improve ourselves in a hostile world like ours that tries to debase us while the lesser men embrace weakness and degeneracy we must embrace strength and discipline while whiners complain about how unfair the world is and how its better to just disengage we must engage the world with greater willpower and defeat our enemies towards this end i propose that we become both resilient and antifragile in every way possible the following are ways you can turn a seemingly negative circumstances into strengths stress although stress has been maligned as the plague of the modern world that wrecks our mental and physical health the way you perceive it makes a profound difference on how it affects you new studies have shown that those who see stress as being toxic suffered damaging health effects while who saw it as being helpful were able to turn it into a source of energy to push them through their challenges so next time you feel stressed from whatever trouble you may be facing remember that it is your friend you must reframe the sensation and believe that its your body trying to help you by changing how you processes stress you can use it to succeed in life obstacles your response to obstacles reveal the kind of man you really are whatever obstacles you may face in your endeavors you have two choices become frustrated and discouraged by it or see it as an opportunity to grow stronger like stress its the weaker mans inclination to view an obstacle as a confirmation of his own helplessness but you must do better and face up to whatever gets in your way use every occasion to grow stronger from your obstacles and if you arent facing enough of them in your life you need to get out and start doing more things how you deal with obstacle will show your true nature as a man for the world to see so dont pussy out or moan about what you must overcome instead be determined to rise above it your honor is at stake failures failures are inevitable in life although you should always try your best to succeed you shouldnt be afraid to fail either just as with obstacles view every instance of failure as an opportunity to learn and adapt its not failure itself that is bad but not learning from it or giving up so easily remember winners dont quit they try to do better rejection rejection is a specific kind of failure that is often the most painful of them all its especially difficult because its often unclear whether it was actually your fault or not i would say that its best to assume full responsibility for all the rejections you face and see what area you can improve to better increase your chance next time as long as youre willing to learn and as long as youre willing to try again you will grow master rejections and youll be placing yourself far above other men physical discomfort this is why russians are so tough its well known that the human body is designed to be antifragile your bones get thicker with every blow and your skin gets tougher with every scrap pain and discomfort of all sorts also become more bearable the more you expose yourself to them the more harshness you endure the stronger you become over time but inversely the more comfortable you are the softer you turn and the weaker you get one simple method you can implement to become more healthy and energized is to start taking cold showers the benefits of doing it are many including stronger immune system enhanced mood and energy better circulation boost in testosterone level and so on if you are having trouble getting started start by doing just seconds at the end of your usual warm shower and go from there you want to train yourself until you can comfortably stand under the coldest water for at least five minutes fear you cant really turn fear itself into a positive but the process of conquering your fears can have a transformative effect on your life some of the proudest most exciting and memorable moments of my life were when i defied fears by doing a presentation in front of hundreds of people i had a terrible stagefright going rock climbing i have a terrible fear of heights and traveling for the first time by myself to a foreign country one thing you can do to completely turn your life around is to do what this man did and make a list of all the fears that you wish to defeat write them down in an order from the least fearful to the most and start knocking them down one by one its impossible not to become a better man once you conquer them all anger like fear anger is not something you can transform into a positive trait ive heard of people transmutating their anger to rechannel the energy into other activities but ive never had it work that way however it is a good focal point to master your mind to become more stoic it can also serve as your area of focus if you practice meditation no matter how unpleasant your anger will teach you a lot about yourself and only if you allow it it will reveal your weaknesses insecurities and any other areas of your life in need of improvement as one of the most base and primal of human emotions you shouldnt just shirk it as something that is unneeded instead make it your friend negativity and pessimism for the longest time i felt guilty about being so negative because i was constantly told by everyone else that it was a bad thing smile they said think positively they said your life will improve they said i was constantly berated for not being part of the north american positivity cult its no wonder why people there tend to say that theyre doing great even when theyre feeling like shit a habit i have yet to fix but in contrary to the long held belief that positive thinking and attitude gives you a better life studies have shown just the opposite forced positivity can actually harm you for some people like me positive thinking backfires and makes things worse also badtempered people who are pessimists have been shown to enjoy more successful marriages be healthier live longer be better at negotiating and more successful overall in life so if youre a natural grouch like me its time to embrace who you are and tell the fakeass positivity people to shove it conclusion the road to selfimprovement is an ugly and a bumpy one i honestly cant say that i enjoy it but no matter what i know that it is a necessary part of being a man i cant imagine myself not trying to be better in spite of all the difficulties i refuse to live a life of complacency some people mock and insult our efforts but know that their opinions dont matter lesser men have no say on what it means to live so fight on and prosper for this is your one and only life,1

shepherd boy david and the giant goliath in the biblical encounter david prevailed by keeping his foe goliath at a distance with a formidable weapon his sling today a modernday version of david and goliath is playing out although granted political asylum by ecuador a target of us empire finds himself ensconced under a form of arbitrary detention in ecuadors london embassy under constant surveillance by british police the fully weaponized us empire which boasts of its fullspectrum dominance has arrayed itself and its allies against one unarmed as in having no conventional weaponry man who heads a publishing organization this uppity publisher has had the temerity to expose the secret machinations and war crimes of the militaryeconomic albeit faltering on both fronts behemoth to the worlds public the protransparency publisher wikileaks its founder and de facto political prisoner julian assange and antisecrecy collaborators infuriated the united states establishment with a slew of documents emails and graphic exposes like the collateral murder video that demonstrated a us military engaged in war crimes nations states are adamant and fastidious about keeping their internal workings under wraps but it is a oneway street as many nation states seek to gather and store any and all information about the citizenry without seeking court approval or the approval of the citizenry in question more swedish government implicated in charges against assange un body to rule on arbitrary detention of wikileaks founder websavvy wikileaks objects to this double standard and it welcomes vets and publishes troves of secret information premised on the principle of the publics right to be informed about what their government is up to evidence makes it clear that the violent american establishment engages in browbeating inciting socalled color revolutions to destabilize and overthrow disobedient governments military encirclement and saber rattling this selfdescribed indispensable nation which preens its might before major nation states such as china and russia was not about to have its fullspectrum dominance challenged by punk computer hackers leaning on its allies the us enacted a financing squeeze on wikileaks many nation states have been severely crippled and devastated by us sanctions but tiny wikileaks proved more resilient and cleverer than the washington schemers in an attempt to topple wikileaks the us establishment has sought to lop off the head of wikileaks it has kept close tabs on julian assange and is purportedly behind a scheme to bring assange down in sweden we have been warned that the pentagon for example is thinking of deploying dirty tricks to ruin us in sweden consensual sex has been parlayed as rape in selfdefense assange spoke to the facts of the situation here we have a case the swedish case where i have never been charged with a crime where i have already been cleared by the stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent where the woman herself said that the police made it up where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum those are the facts but what is the rhetoric the un formally found that the whole thing is illegal never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes i am subject to persecution by the united states disinformation and distraction are among the underhanded tactics of empire while in britain assange was eventually placed under house arrest sweden played out the drama while refusing to press charges or interview assange in britain on the allegations it insisted he come to sweden which assange was unwilling to do without an assurance that he would not be deported elsewhere knowing full well that the us department of justice was preparing a case against him sweden refused to give such an assurance which speaks strongly about swedens intent to seek justice for any alleged crimes committed against its citizens despite all this intrigue wikileaks has continued to publish and assange has continued to give interviews assange did not cower instead he chose to fight back against hillary clinton and the democrats this is because hillary clinton and the democrats are the principals in power and the grand jury investigation into himself and wikileaks has been occurring during their time in government clinton and the democrats are victims of their own zeal and hubris along the way many outs presented themselves to the democrats they could have dropped the grand jury investigation they could have provided an assurance that there would be no request for assanges deportation from sweden the us could even have given a presidential pardon to assange extremely telling about the caliber of man that assange is is that he offered himself as a prisoner in exchange for the release of another political prisoner chelsea manning but empire and its minions were dismissive as is the way of empire empire does not negotiate deals it takes what it wants because it believes it can the result the corruption in the democratic party has come to light wikileaks revealed that the democratic national committee conspired against party aspirant bernie sanders and heads fell clinton tellingly hired the subsequently fallen dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz clintons emails were leaked as were those of her campaign chair john podesta revelations include payforplay as they call it giving access in exchange for money to states individuals and corporations a direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism of isil in the middle east libya more than anyone elses war was hillary clintons war and banks buying cabinet positions the clinton campaign has predictably been thrown into disarray the clintonites could not refute what was in their own emails instead they sought to deflect attention elsewhere the clintonites blamed russian hacking for interfering in the us presidential race finally julian assange felt compelled to state the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neomccarthy hysteria that russia is responsible for everything hilary clinton stated multiple times falsely that seventeen us intelligence agencies had assessed that russia was the source of our publications that is false we can say that the russian government is not the source neither is wikileaks complicit with russia we have published about documents of various kinds that relate to russia most of those are critical and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia most of which are critical our russiadocuments have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia which they use our documents to back up graciously toward clinton assange said he feels sorry for the woman who wanted to drone him imagine what the response would have been if assange had discussed the possibility of a drone attack against clinton presently assange downplays the damage from the barrage of leaks to the clinton campaign for the presidency trump would not be permitted to win why do i say that because hes had every establishment off side trump doesnt have one establishment maybe with the exception of the evangelicals if you can call them an establishment but banks intelligence agencies arms companies big foreign money are all united behind hillary clinton and the media as well media owners and even journalists themselves however a counter coup was announced against the coup by clinton cronyism it is said to include fbi cia military intelligence other security organizations through julian assange that have promised to stop clinton from becoming president and to convict and indict her and her cronies a revolution no matter what transpires on november the reverberations from this confrontation should be monumental us democracy has again been revealed to be glaringly corrupt most importantly the worlds preeminent militaryindustrial complex has been shown to be susceptible to the power of one person properly framed it is the power of one person to work with other persons to form a greater consciousness a consciousness that ultimately will transcend and defeat the corruption of empire,0

and hygiene here are six more overhyped figures revered by leftists who always get everything wrong franklin delano roosevelt how the world remembers fdr led america through the great depression and wwii remembered fondly by seniors who heard his inspiring fireside chats the ugly truth some economists argue that fdrs measures prolonged the great depression all the new deal programs were struck down as unconstitutional except social security he got the supreme court to back off by threatening to pack the court with more members with views to his liking that restrained their judicial opinion though the constitution doesnt grant congress the power to create a federal retirement system social security worksthough its slim pickings if its a retirees only incomeand for decades the surplus has been a cash cow offsetting congressional overspending however the aging baby boomers who didnt have enough children might turn the cash cow into an albatross further the social security number is now a defacto universal id number a convenient database field for monitoring citizens americas founding fathers would have been appalled at todays domestic spying and the soviet dictators of old would have wept with envy fdr pledged to keep the usa out of wwii meanwhile he quietly did everything possible to antagonize japan a oncefriendly nation such as among several items freezing their assets and cutting off their oil supply when he got intelligence of the upcoming attack on pearl harbor he didnt order the base to be locked and loaded if that wasnt bad enough so nearly a quarter million americans died in battle but at least the pivotal intervention came just in time to make the world safe for democracy right unfortunately fdr was far too friendly with the ussr giving them nearly billion in food weaponry and other supplies about billion adjusted for inflation at the yalta conference fdr agreed to let uncle joe stalin take over eastern europe general patton wanted to press forward at full speed to keep as much territory as possible away from soviet tyranny but politics hampered him every step of the way until he got rubbed out when the iron curtain rose and the cold war began winston churchill said we slaughtered the wrong pig if only roosevelt had listened to his generals fdr wasnt a communist but many of his appointees and trusted advisers were later joseph mccarthy barely scratched the surface trying to get rid of them walter cronkite how the world remembers he was a longtime cbs anchorman reporting many triumphs and tragedies a friendly face on living room tvs for decades he became everyones uncle walter according to polls he was the most trusted man in america the ugly truth although a decent fellow in person cronkite was the archetypal bigname liberal journalist spinning the news for decades sometimes it was rather subliminal including his signature subtle sneer most of the public then believed journalists were muckrakers and unbiased truthtellers as cronkites tagline went and thats the way it is until cronkites late career the mainstream media had a veneer of respectabilityperhaps like warped plastic barely sticking to crumbling particleboard but a veneer nonetheless there once were only three american corporate tv networks from manhattan they were the publics information gatekeepers no other broadcast news besides shortwave radio was available baby boomer liberals might get a bit mistyeyed remembering those days today six megaconglomerates own of the media but at least the internet lets us present our own perspectives and call out biased reporters if that wasnt bad enough his biggest whopper was about the tet offensive the viet cong launched a desperate allout assault suffered very heavy losses mostly it was over within a day and ultimately the vc gained no territory however the most trusted man in america gave them a propaganda victory reporting that the vietnam war was hopeless public opinion promptly turned against the war ho chi minh shouldve given cronkite a medal an honorary vc generalship and a dozen roses many forget that the paris accords brought peace two years later though the shaky ford administration couldnt persuade congress to respond appropriately to a shit test by north vietnam then they invaded and saigon fell all thats a long story but public opinion from biased reporting certainly didnt help that affected americas prestige abroad along with the lives of millions of south vietnamese killed or sent to reeducation camps allen ginsberg how the world remembers he was a pioneer of the beatniks much beloved by the hippies who followed and lauded with several literary prizes some even credit him with basically starting the s counterculture singlehandedly the ugly truth ginsberg was neurotic and a degenerate he wrote a socalled poem about his sphincter yes really but the rest isnt much better anyone considering his bathroom wall ravings as profound either is educated beyond his ability to comprehend believed the hype and didnt read it or dropped too much acid howl his bestknown poem begins i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness a brief excerpt get some brain bleach describing these best minds who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of capitalism who distributed supercommunist pamphlets in union square weeping and undressing while the sirens of los alamos wailed them down and wailed down wall and the staten island ferry also wailed who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists and screamed with joy who blew and were blown by those human seraphim the sailors caresses of atlantic and caribbean love who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may even overlooking the lunacy buggery and butthurt ginsbergs free verse is stylistically lazy back when poetry meant keats and kipling it rhymed and had meter he was a noted critic of the usa for example america i used to be a communist when i was a kid im not sorry ginsberg visited several communist countries getting himself deported from some of them for immorality he abandoned his ancestral faith for buddhism and had a hare krishna phase what people believe is up to them of course but adding these two things upalong with his wretched poetryreveals a tortured soul rejecting everything one belongs to is childish rebellion for rebellions sake granted ginsbergs popularity was greatest during the screwedup kill your parents s still what were those who promoted his crapulous drivel smoking were the literary gatekeepers pushing cultural marxism running out of talented writers if that wasnt bad enough ginsberg joined the north american manboy love association sometimes speaking kindly on their behalf explaining in an accurately titled interviewpolitics pederasty and consciousnessto the harvard crimson as i get older having very specialised sexual tastes it gets harder to make out i like young boys why id have more chance at making out with younger guys if i were younger dewier dewylimbed the media usually portrays pickup artists as reprobates and screeched about donald trumps yearsold private locker room talk but the presstitutes likewise the lefty intelligentsia fawningly praised ginsberg despite his appetite for young boys ted kennedy best friends forever east and west how the world remembers he was the lion of the senate representing massachusetts from until his death in this champion of social justice carried on the kennedy legacyhailed as americas nobilityafter his two brothers were tragically slain the ugly truth he was as passionate for booze and adultery as he was for social justice but the suckers kept reelecting him his lack of character sank way deeper though all the way underwater after a night of partying on chappaquiddick island ted kennedy drove off a bridge he escaped but failed to help his passenger mary jo kopechne per one of the investigators she suffocated slowly in an air pocket for about two hours if hed ran to a nearby house for helprather than waiting nine hours to sober upshe wouldve survived he got a two month suspended sentence barely a slap on the wrist for vehicular manslaughter the judge basically said poor teddy had suffered enough what about how miss kopechne suffered theres one set of rules for the elites and another for us shortly thereafter he tried to spindoctor it with a woe is me shtick the suckers kept reelecting him though a presidential bid was now beyond reach as for his many legislative actions the immigration and nationality act of was the most notorious he promised the public first our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually under the proposed bill the present level of immigration remains substantially the same secondly the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset contrary to the charges in some quarters the bill will not inundate america with immigrants from any one country or area or the most populated and deprived nations of africa and asia in the final analysis the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think the bill will not flood our cities with immigrants it will not upset the ethnic mix of our society it will not relax the standards of admission it will not cause american workers to lose their jobs the lion of the senate was lyin his fat ass off this population replacement policy threatens americas future just as the coudenhovekalergi plan is doing in europe still the suckers kept reelecting him if that wasnt bad enough besides giving away the country to which the constitution granted the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity lyin ted was in cahoots with the kgb he proposed to help his soviet pal yuri andropov with tidying up the ussrs image problem during the cold wars endgame the damning documents suggested that walter cronkite see above and barbara walters might be used for this effort conservatives often suspect liberals are soft on communism little did they know how cozy ted kennedy was in bed with comrade andropov john lennon how the world remembers he was a talented musician arguably the most prominent of the beatles their story was an archetypal garage band becoming a bar band and eventually breaking out into great fame lennon produced dozens of hits that still get air play hes remembered as a wonderful man an embodiment of the s the good parts anyway and the conscience of the world the ugly truth despite lennons considerable talents not all his songs were excellent things slipped with the white album revolution really after the beatles broke up he started a solo career often featuring songs with sophomoric political poses his last album produced during his lifeafter dragging himself out of a long heroin stuporwas double fantasy critics at first agreed that it sucked after a nut shot lennon they felt sorry for him and declared it brilliant lennon was the archetypal leftist celebrity using fame to push politics granted everyone has a right to their opinion but being able to sing or act confers no special political expertise his song imagine is particularly telling as he put it imagine that there was no more religion no more country no more politics is virtually the communist manifesto even though im not particularly a communist and i do not belong to any movement being under the shadow of the berlin wall back in their bar gig days shouldve precluded sophomoric posturing like this if that wasnt bad enough his failings are quite troubling too numerous to fully detail one item is abandoning his family the way his own father did a truly wonderful man wouldnt do that another item was his extensive substance abuse he spent guzzling booze his lost weekend one night a waitress refused service because he stuck a menstrual pad on his head then lennon do you know who i am waitress yeah youre some asshole with a kotex on his forehead one lennon biographer asked timothy leary whod been on hundreds of acid trips what lennons extreme lsd consumption would do leary had no idea finally what kind of inner vacuum caused this highly successful musician much beloved by the public to get himself strung out on heroin jimmy carter in this heartwarming scene jimmy carter and uncle fidel stand for the cuban national anthem in havana how the world remembers carter is praised as a rare honest politician exemplifying christian principles and tolerance the ugly truth the economy tanked during the carter administration doubledigit inflation and high unemployment economists are still puzzled by stagflation normally unemployment and inflation are inversely correlated at least obama gave economists another data point to study carters commendably not corrupt but exemplified bleedinghearted liberalism despite winning the nobel peace prize for not being george w bush likewise al gore and the lightworker carter was a lackluster embarrassment he was known for tmi statements for example about his hemorrhoids and committing adultery in his heart at least clinton had the balls to do it for real he ranked lower than mr whipple on a face recognition survey the boston globe reported on one of his speeches with the headline more mush from the wimp finally journalists got something right carters shining foreign policy moment was the camp david accords establishing peace between egypt and israel america started giving over a billion annually to each party for making peace which ironically supplies their military why the usa wasnt even a combatant aside from the uss liberty incident which certainly shouldnt inspire american tribute money taxpayers still fund this absurd protection racket worse he badly bungled the iran hostage crisis one iranian official later stated they wouldve released the hostages if the usa had

the agency to influence our election is deeply troubling share on twitter print this post the following is an opinion column by r muse as a nation of laws the american people should and most likely do demand that law enforcement officials hew as closely to the law as humanly possible and that goes double for the countrys largest investigative agency one thing every american who has ever watched a law enforcement press conference after a crime has occurred understands is that the public never really knows the details of an investigation regardless the severity of the crime or who the suspect is as an occasional print journalist this author can attest that asking a police spokesman for details during a press conference about what the police are doing or who they are investigating never fails to get a stern scolding about expecting law enforcement to reveal any facts during an investigation for glaringly obvious reasons the scold always includes referral to the agency responsible for charging and prosecuting a crime after the investigation is complete and the results are handed over to the local district attorney apparently the federal bureau of investigation fbi director james comey never got the memo that discussing an investigation publicly is verboten if for no other reason than to maintain the integrity of said investigation and not hamper a possible prosecution however as it turns out mr comey did get a memo from the department of justice in the form of a warning but because he is a law unto himself and his allegiance is to house republicans and not the department of justice he ignored the doj counsel to do a solid for the gop less than two weeks before a presidential election since mr comey cant keep it investigations in his pants or follow longstanding law enforcement and investigative rules or take heed to justice department warnings it is incumbent on president barack obama to summarily fire fbi director james comey on the morning of wednesday november th why should president obama wait until the day after a general election to fire the partisan director of the fbi so as not to give the appearance of any impropriety or partisanship during a campaign or just prior a presidential election something fbi director james comey is apparently incapable of comprehending this incident just like the one in july when comey broke precedent and convened a press conference in july and then publicly testified before congress to discuss the bureaus ongoing investigation is more than just a breach of precedent it smacks of partisanship for more than one reason first as mentioned above not only did the department of justice warn mr comey that it was inappropriate to discuss an ongoing investigation at all much less so close to an election that warning came after the fbi contacted the doj about going public with information the bureau admitted it had not yet even reviewed that was precisely what comey told his republican buddies in a letter to congress in the letter comey told congressional republicans that the fbi really had no clue whether any of the emails were related to hillary clintons private email server but what he did know for sure was that they appeared to be pertinent even though his agency the fbi had not yet examined them so the real pertinent question is why did mr comey publicly inform congress about emails the agency had not yet examined if he wasnt attempting to inject some partisan drama into the election that might have deleterious impact on the outcome it is just as pertinent a question as demanding to know from mr comey precisely what his motivation was in holding a press conference back in july to discuss the agencys finding on an investigation before the doj weighed in or discuss that investigation in public and before a viciously partisan republican committee in congress and no it was not to defend the bureaus decision not to bring criminal charges against clinton only a braindead moronic imbecile or partisan republican hack would begin to think that the fbi cia local sheriff or any police investigative agency has the ability to bring charges to prosecute a violation for dogs sake even the s fictional sheriff andy griffiths hapless deputy barney fife was competent enough to comprehend that a district attorneys office or department of justice is tasked with prosecution any violation of the law according to mr comey who was stung by criticism from both democrats and republicans as well as former prosecutors and appeared to be on the defensive he felt obligated to inform republicans in congress even though the bureau really didnt know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails likely because he knew they did not come from hillary clinton as an aside sarah jones has a nifty summary of the email caper the fbi uncovered while investigating serial sexter anthony weiners laptop computer ipad and cellphone and no anthony weiner was not sexting nasty pictures to presidential candidate hillary clinton it doesnt matter what kind of pathetic excuse comey gave for publicly commenting on an ongoing investigation it is virtually impossible to believe he didnt have partisan intents and purposes in publicly alerting house republicans as interim chairwoman of the democratic national committee donna brazile said the fbi has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters even the faintest appearance of using the agencys power to influence our election is deeply troubling ms brazile demanded more information from comey and didnt conceal her concern over comey interfering with the election mr comey claimed very conveniently one might add that as a diedinthewool republican he contributed to john mccain and willard romneys presidential campaigns in and respectively that he is not a republican now that was his remark back in july when he first began breaking precedent and revealing information about an investigation that was the proper purview of the department of justice not the federal bureau of investigation it was a suspicious confession in july and it is nearly impossible to believe in late october after he ignored department of justice warnings and revealed information about an ongoing investigation into a disgraced former congressman and serial sexter just days before an election and before the bureau had even reviewed anything comey cannot possibly remain as head of the federal bureau of investigation after twice revealing information about an ongoing investigation if comey hadnt taken heat for his reveal in july and a warning from the justice department this week then one might just regard him as an inept law enforcement official pulling a publicity stunt for attention but since he was warned and is not an inept law enforcement official it is more than reasonable to believe that comeys most recent act was a partisan political ploy that should earn him a summary termination on november because firing his partisan personage just prior to the general election would break a longstanding precedent and look like a highly partisan move something a sap like james comey might try but not president obama,1

to bully india shares there are only weeks left until we find out if we have a president trump or a president clinton donald trump is perceived as the candidate who is against the corrupt establishment while hillary clinton is seen as part and fabric of the establishment and as the most corrupt candidate to run for president in the history of the country a president clinton in a few weeks would return us to the hostile climate towards india that we saw in the s overseen by her husband after he took office in the us relationship with india went on a considerable downslide for nearly a year clinton did not bother appointing an ambassador to india even as he went about opposing india on multiple fronts leading to anger in the indian establishment initially he was intent on disarming and weakening india by preventing access to technology and also mounted a sustained attack on the indian economy by imposing several economic sanctions in senator joe biden who is now the vice president under barack obama introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to russia making the aid conditional on the fact that russia could not sell cryogenic engines for indias space programme the clinton administration was hellbent on hurting the development of indias space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of cray supercomputers that had been approved under the ronald reagan administration india was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the super clause of the american trade law these economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way mr clinton attacked the indian textile and carpet industries throughout the s the terms dunkel draft super wto and patent laws became synonyms for the us attempts to retard the indian economy and led to many protests in india by india was justified in believing that indous relations had hit the lowest point but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during bill clintons second term in office madeleine albright became the new secretary of state and she was increasingly hostile to india especially through her pseudoracist television outbursts in fact she loved attacking india so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in kashmir justifying the actions of violent groups in the process more clintons policies look like a death sentence for americans things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital remember this is the same bloodsoaked albright who advocated bombing yugoslavia and then got her investment firm to attempt a takeover of mines in that country like the clintons she also knows how to abuse her power lest we forget albright also justified the deaths of half a million iraqi children and claimed that the deaths were worth it and the icing on the cake for this particularly nasty woman albright has already threatened women in america and claimed that there was a special place in hell reserved for them if they did not vote for hillary clinton there is already talk of joe biden in the frame as secretary of state under hillary clinton biden would continue his antiindia agenda and try to thwart the development of indias space programme and other technological advancements then of course there is hillarys closest confidante a duplicitous lady called huma abedin who is of pakistani descent and whose family has links to radical elements in pakistan and saudi arabia abedin could end up playing an important role in determining american foreign policy and would be certainly antimodi another point against hillary clinton is that the hawkish henry kissinger has supports her and her oeuvre as secretary of state this is the same kissinger who is so hostile against india many of his racist statements are even on tape to that end it is in the light of this setting that many indianamericans have opposed the candidacy of hillary clinton and have come out in support of donald trump in contrast to the policies of the clintons trump has promised to make india the best friend of the us and has stated that he looks forward to working with prime minister narendra modi trump has also reached out to hindus in us while there is always a risk of the unknown and it is not clear if trump can make the change he wants to a hillary presidency will certainly be a major step back for india in order for india to build a constructive relationship with us it requires people in both countries to have good intentions it is clear that india cannot have a strong and forward looking relationship with the us if hillary clinton is running the corridors of power on the other hand donald trump has articulated the right intent and his stance holds promise for india,0

soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police matt agorist august comments memos and documents published by dcleaks continue shedding light on billionaire globalist george soros and his progressive organization open society foundations osf due to their poor digital curation however the leaks are hard to comb through which is leading to the information slowly trickling out the latest of the documents reveals the billionaires attempt to organize a national movement to create a federalized police force the document shows that osf saw the killings of mike brown eric garner walter scott and freddie gray as an opportunity to implement this mission of federal police guidelines osf according to the documents then held a meeting titled police reform how to take advantage of the crisis of the moment and drive longterm institutional change in policecommunity practice the memo further documents that sorosfinanced groups and personalities influenced a task force on st century policing created by president obama last may the task force released a final report consisting of recommendations recommending protocol to local departments on how to modify policing practices the information is from a page report of an open society us programs board meeting that took place in new york city in may of last year states the board meeting document the federal government is seeking philanthropic support for a number of its initiatives in addition to seeking support to advance the implementation of the recommendations of the presidential taskforce the white house recently launched the policing data initiative to explore how best to use data and technology to build trust voice and solutions to improve community policing the department of justice recently selected the first six cities to host pilot sites for the national initiative for building community trust and justice which was launched last fall to help repair and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve by exploring strategies intended to enhance procedural justice reduce implicit bias and support racial reconciliation we are gaining a better understanding of these efforts in order to determine how best usp can use this moment to create a national movement we have already had a set of preliminary conversations with about a dozen key stakeholders and will undertake a field scan to map the areas of work currently underway to advance police reform including an assessment of the redundancies and gaps in work and opportunities for collaboration as we proceed we will engage the funder network we helped to establish the executive alliance on men and boys of color which now includes forty foundations us programs usp is a part of osf with the stated mission of working to further a vibrant democratic society in which all people can meaningfully participate in its civic economic and political life according to the above excerpt usp was thinking of ways to capitalize on police killings to create a national movement to implement their agenda the think tank also raises the question of how to properly steer the ostensible grassroots organizations such as black lives matter to achieve usp goals the events of the past several months have understandably led to a wide range of activities including a variety of advocacy efforts to respond to the significant challenges in policing that have been exposed and the opportunity to promote meaningful and lasting change for example organized under the banner of the civil rights coalition on police reform organizations like the lawyers committee for civil rights under the law lcchr and ldf are advocating for federal reform efforts with a particular emphasis on data collection and transparency and as noted above effecting federal funding streams a variety of other national advocacy organizations including grantees advancement project policylink the center for popular democracy and the aclu are working to provide advocates with toolkits and resources to help their organizing efforts locally based groups such as the ohio student association the organization for black struggle the asian law caucus and the aclu of new jersey to name a few are advocating for specific reforms at the city and state levels another layer of grassroots and youthoriented groups like freedom side ferguson action black lives matter and million hoodies movement for justice are also advocating for specific reforms the range of efforts underway raises a number of questions and concerns about capacity the need for coordination and the appropriate prioritization of policy objectives among others which we will discuss in the policing portion of the meeting while the intentions of reforming police in america seem noble the very idea of a sorosled initiative is chilling another memo leaked earlier this month showed the billionaire was potentially funding the black lives matter movement to the tune of now as todays memo shows we know why as the free thought project has pointed out many times before soros has been exposed literally manipulating the world earlier this month in an email found within the wikileaks hillary clinton archive with the subject unrest in albania soros makes clear to clinton that two things need to be done urgently he then directs the secretary of state to bring the full weight of the international community to bear on prime minister berisha and appoint a senior european official as mediator revealing the influence he wields within the corridors of power soros then provides secretary of state clinton with three names from which to choose unsurprisingly clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials recommended by soros miroslav lajcak this is standard operating procedure for soros anyone familiar with the history of the soros open society foundations in eastern europe and around the world since the late s will know that his supposedly philanthropic democracybuilding projects in poland russia or ukraine in the s allowed soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries wealth according to the new eastern outlook sorosaffiliated organizations are deeply connected to numerous color revolutions such as the arab spring and a number of other uprisings across the world they have been intimately involved in the coup that took place in ukraine and subsequent ratcheting up of cold war tensions with russia as these leaked memos and emails prove the united states is nothing more than one of soros pawns while americans remain oblivious and argue over straw men fed to them by the mainstream media the police state is growing both here and abroad as the citizens are promised reform

mr prince when he gets robbed assaulted in anyway he wants to call razedbywolvs to help him because no one else will get real the constitution states that the states should govern themselves not let the government do it nishi i have never been so naive as to think that smart and engaged people refrained from brainstorming solutions together according to their shared beliefs nor have i ever thought that would be a good idea cole tell this so called journalist that he cant complain about soros trying to change the direction of our police force before it turns into a police state then at the end of the article try himself to tell us we need to be on the watchout for a police state shusei right there is no evil plan in these memos i dont know much about soros if he is evil guy or good guy but least i can say is this article is bs and many people in here have no ability to read understand and think prince somebody really needs to put a bullet in soros head despicable rem certified dont leave out his son greg geitner now its easy to see why soros was paying them to act out ricialove as a black woman heres what i want to knowwith all that money that blm receiveswhat the heck do they do anna miller george soros is a criminal subversive who has created havoc on a global level and for a long time his crimes are welldocumented he is the billonaire who broke the british pound in he is responsible for funding numerous revolutions including the coup in ukraine toppling a democratically elected president and moving nato closer to russian borders and funding ngos who were not really charities but subversive infiltrators he is an evil man have you noticed how many billonaire jews are involved in all kinds of evil financial schemes and or hold such high positions in both neoliberal as well as neocon both sides of the fencegovernment positions although they only make up of the populace why hasnt this criminal been arrested his aim is to deliberately stir up a race war the police are attacking people of all colors and ages yet blm seems to defend black men who were in truth guilty at least they could pick a black man or woman who was actually innocent why doesnt black lives matter defend blacks who have been murdered by other blacks which is usually the case or dont those black lives matter and how about the of black children born to single mothers with no father in the home often to siblings from multiple fathers these children often grow up to be street thugs the facts bear this out blacks do commit most of the crime in the us and commit more crimes against whites as well the issue should be on the increasing police brutality on all citizens not only focused on black lives the police target them more because blacks commit most of the crime does the truth enter this equation blm detracts from the entire populace of all races focusing together on increased police brutality against the public at large for soros and those who want to increase antiwhite sentiment and race tensions blm is mission accomplished the bastard soros should have been arrested a long time ago and imprisoned and not in one of those cushy hotel prisons either and one can only wonder who is really running this nation when soros remains unfettered dan maybe just maybe hitler saw something that the rest of the world still can not see or simply refuses to see az patriot what are you saying all jews should have been sent to the gas chamber so that soros wouldnt be around dan oh right your one of those kinds of people huh next you are going to tell me that they really did make lampshades and soap out of jews huh az patriot if i were you i wouldnt continue to show your ignorance insensitivity and anti jew sentiment go away dan im ignorant bwahahah heres an easy one for ya whats minus carolyn idiot must run in your family carolyn dan you are an atheist who wants the world to believe that hitler did not slaughter millions of jews go to the holocaust museums filled with the pictures and tools the nazis used to experiment on the children pictures taken by the american soldiers when they entered into the prisons so go into a hellnory site and w her with your crap dan so explain to me how they had to change the plaque at auschwitz in the s from claiming million died there to only just over million and its now believed that its not even million that died there and you dare to call me the idiot keep googling im sure you can find it carolyn i did not call you an idiot but i should have auschwitz was only one of many concentration and death camps you check it out dan wow you have shown your level of stupid on levels in the one post good work but i digress ad hominems like yours only exist to show your own lack of a reasonable argument auschwitz was well known to have been by far the largest concentration camp during ww with the greatest population compared to all other camps it even boasted a swimming pool inside the camp for its population how do they just lose million deaths from that camp if auschwitz could not accomodate million deaths but only closer to million how did the other much smaller camps process more deaths than alschwitz now here is hte real kicker from back in jews were already claiming the million decades into the future its in the damn newspapers and you can freely search and find them for yourself care to explain how that happened jew magic i guess httpsuploadsdisquscdncomimagesefadbaaaeddfeefdeedfffebacfbfjpg carolyn dan did you read any of the small incomplete articles evidently not m was quoted to show that russia and other countries had that many jews nothing about death these prior years to were expressing the plight of how the jewish people were being treated now auschwitz was not the only camp that slaughtered jews now does that sign specifically say that auschwitz deaths were just auschwitz murders your damn newspapers need to be read by you before you put that smudge attitude in writing dan wow your brain really is broken huh you cant see the connection between claiming the magical million prophecy which is actually about claiming the heartland in and using that same exact figure in the lies about ww the same lies that the nazis also made lampshades and soap out of jews auschwitz plaque was obviously blatantly lying just like the lampshades and soap myths once the soviets were forced to give up the ledgers iirc in the s it was obvious that they could no longer sustain the lie that million were killed there and were forced to bring that number down to about million are you really that stupid that you can not see the pattern here there is a hell of a lot more but i get the feeling that im talking to someone to stupid to even grasp the basics fun fact anne frank never wrote anne franks diary otto bought the story from another novelist and changed it to reflect his daughter there was even a recent copyright case where they are now claiming that he was the author fun times carolyn oh i see your pattern believe that crap instead of what the pictures written accounts by the liberation armies and you did not answer my question on the articles you want to point to that does not say m jews died did you pull all of the articles and read the whole story i would bet you did not you are a typical atheist marxist democrat you can pound your chest again when you check history and find out that the democraps started the kkk group and were the biggest slave owners you people amaze me how you put crap out there that you can not back up kind of like your loving candidate hellnory dan show me a single picture of gassed jews or even of the gas chambers themselves or even the several thousand dead jews they would have to have piled up waiting for their several hours in the crematorium it actually took back then to cremate even a single body or you mean i am meant to take the word of the proven lying jews who to this day like in the video i linked above have clung to their fantasies even after they have been busted lying as for the liberating armies you do recall that all the gas chambers were in ruins when they came through and there was zero evidence besides the lamp shades and soap of any jew holocaust that account you mean and of course it dosnt say that million died yet only that they were in peril etc but you dont find it a mighty large coincidence you also obviously have no idea how they came up with the million at the end of ww do you go find out where that number came from the person who made it up even claimed it was completely symbolic and not to be taken literally you are a typical atheist marxist democrat and in the face of clear defeat out with the mindless ad hominem once again a clear indicator that you are way outside of your depth you are incorrect on all counts once again do you ever get anything right were the biggest slave owners guess who the biggest slave owners were fucking jews hahaha they owned all the slave ships and were behind every facet of the trade kind of like your loving candidate hellnory and thats the funniest go find my twitter feed its full of anti hillary sentiment in fact its the only reason i really began using twitter was during this election cycle to keep track of whats going on because i refuse to engage in the corrupt leftist media once again mostly jew owned for fear of turning into a brainless zombie like yourself ill give you this tho you certainly are persistent in your stupidity its no wonder you cant see anything thats going on around you in this world dan here is a great classic you really should watch about his explaining away his lies as not really lies httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjswiomiak carolyn you really have a real talent referencing things dan yea this is how you learn things you take a fairytale lets use santa as an example and you work out when your like years old how can there be santas in the same place why are my presents always in the bottom of my parents wardrobe a week before santa apparently brings them to you a week later and slowly you deduce that there is no santa clause and its just a lie that you have been fed while your brain is all still mushy or you know you can just blindly have faith that there is still a santa you know like you do even in the face of such a mountain of evidence carolyn you need to stop your atheistic info because you do not know what you are talking about m jews killed in all of the auschwitz camps did you know that there were large camps with large crematoriums no you did not that is just a drop in the bucket places that murdered experimented on starved gased and shooting of jews k hungary k poland k france k netherlands k greece k boheman moravia k slovakia k belgium k yugoslavia k itally norway and k from other countries k jews k poles k gypsies k soviet prisoners k czecks yugoslavs french germans did you know that hitler had built camps death camps concentration camps holding camps gas camp vans labor camps and detention camps many jews died in ghettos on trains during the death march to evade the oncoming of the russian army and us forces these camps were set up in france russia germany poland and austria one of the camps berkenau killed thousand jews per day in total m jews killed in killing centers and jews shot gased experimented on now how do you explain your decision to not believe these totals dan of course i knew i obviously know more about the subject than you do like you i came from a place of believing the lies until i started questioning some of the facts i was taught and the advent of the internet and survivors videos where they constantly get busted telling lies made me reconsider the truth about ww actually current scholars beleive its somewhere between k and i think its k it might be k died in all of auschwitz while i do not doubt that there was some experimenting america was doing the same thing but on its own people at the time the great majority were simply natural attrition in a time of war considering the allies were bombing supply lines constantly yet never the camps themselves because they also knew they were not death camps in fact lets invoke the story of the holocaust poster child again anne frank if they were really gassing people in some huge manner why would they even keep around a weak sickly girl long enough for her to die from typhus and yes of course many people died many of them jews thats what happens when you have wars none of this supports gassing or mass extermination of jews stupid but my final question is how do you blindly believe the word of people who have been shown on many occasions to be liars specially in the face of so much verifiable evidence to the contrary ie the lampshades soap diesel gassing vans eye witness stories that completely contradict everything etc specially knowing the fact that many jews chose to escape with their german captors rather than await the soviet armys rescue carolyn of course you did not know any of the information i wrote if you profess that you know how many died then go on the holocaust site and you will see that after they checked the records that the germans kept you do know they tattooed the jews to make sure what numbers were dead or alive how would i know why they kept anne franks till she died of typhus they very cruel people the jews were at war with the nazi germans what the hell are you talking about if you go on the site you will see pictures of the gas chambers and crematories what the hell else do you want why dont you go to auschwitz and see for yourself you are so bigoted and i believe you are a lousy democrap despicable rem certified hitler has the rothschild and other bank roll him while killing off the poor and middle class jews who hardly dominate their own street block let alone the world as a true socialist he had the pragmatic double standards so many on the left have today az patriot you are painting all jews with a very broad brush no all jews not all billionaire jews are involved in evil schemes stop it despicable rem certified soros is to jew as kerry kaine biden pilosi or kennedy is to roman catholic soros is to jew like ryan or beck are to conservative or and a better example soros is to jew like oblamer is to christian anna miller yes all these people have one thing in common they claim connection to the evil hebrew yahweh the tyrannical iron age war volcano god happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks just another evil scripture found in your not so holy book psalm stop making excuses for evil despicable rem certified howdy anna i an sorry i didnt make myself clear i was stating none of those people are believing jews or christians they believe they are god anna miller they have no humility nor conscience tatiana covington,1

democrat criminals who need to be locked up for life they are a danger to democracy and a danger to a free society they are sociopaths liars cheats and even murderers they are fraudsters and political

tolerate your lies and corruption any longer we the people are going to arrest you indict you prosecute you and see you and your coconspirators behind bars where you belong the trump movement is awakening tens of millions of americans to the astonishing criminality of the democrats in washington theres an unstoppable movement rising up in america now that simply will not tolerate filthy democrats stealing our democracy and conning their way into power if they steal the election we will take to the streets and declare a clinton presidency illegitimate and illegal we will stand behind

your days of tyranny and totalitarian domination are rapidly coming to an end and you will soon face the informed justice of an enraged population that refuses to be enslaved by your incessant corruption and wretched government racketsfrom breitbartcom racketeering former prosecutor andrew mccarthy has recently observed that hillary clintons abuse of the state department looks an awful lot like a racketeering enterprise which could trigger the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of more widely known as rico mccarthy explainedunder rico an enterprise can be any association of people informal or formal illegitimate or legitimate it could be a mafia family an ostensibly charitable foundation or a department of government it is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity a pattern means merely two or more violations of federal or state law these violations constitute racketeering activity if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute its time to defeat clinton followed by arresting all the clinton operatives and initiating hundreds of federal prosecution cases against these third world fraudsters thats how we take back america restore democracy and regain public trust in law and order note to the feds arrest the democrat criminals or lose any semblance of legal authority in america remember if federal authorities do not arrest and prosecute the clintons and all their coconspirators they essentially forfeit any real claim to legitimate legal authority at that point the citizens will realize they no longer have any logical obligation to pay federal taxes obey federal laws abide by federal regulations or consent to be governed by anybody in washington at allafter all a nation run by a system that refuses to hold its leaders accountable for their criminal conduct is a nation that can no longer claim to operate under the rule of law at that point justice becomes a sad tragic joke against the citizens and the nation soon finds itself on the verge of a mass citizens revolt if the fbi wont seek criminal indictments against hillary clinton and her criminal cohorts

what were the driving factors that propelled trump to the presidency how was he able to pull off such a stunning upset here are seven reasons why trump won hillary clinton was unable to get the minority vote to turn out for her last night dems were calling the race a whitelash wrong mitt won of white vote trump won minority voters didnt turn out david french davidafrench november in fact trump was able to get a larger share of the minority vote than mitt romney did in as the daily wire has explained unsurprisingly trump lost to clinton in the latino and black votes by margins of percent to percent and percent and percent respectively surprisingly this was better than romney fared among the aforementioned demographics in as he lost both groups by margins of percent to percent and percent to percent respectively michael barone has noted that turnout fell in heavily black philadelphia cleveland detroit and milwaukee millennial generation turnout was tepid and trump carried white millennials by points the enthusiasm was just not there for clinton trump was able to pull in former obama voters according to the washington post trump was able to win over onethird of the counties that went for obama twice clinton was only able to win six of the counties that didnt go for obama trump was better at obtaining crossover voters than clinton was so who are these former obama voters who voted for trump in and what caused them to switch these former obama voters felt that trump cared about them and the democrat party did not john daniel davidson explains in the federalist that clinton and the democrat party took the bluecollar working class whites in the rust belt for grantedexemplified by clintons pledge to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of businessand it was to their detriment the rust belt has been in economic decline for years but it has suffered greatly from the obama administrations regulations towards coal while the democrats wrote off the rust belt trump actually acknowledged their struggles and that was all it took trump was the first national political figure in generations who saw them acknowledged that they have been left behind that their cities and towns are in a state of persistent decline and promised to help out somehow writes davidson when youre used to being dismissed as bitter folks who cling to guns and religion as president obama did in or denounced as deplorables and irredeemable as hillary clinton did during this election respect goes a long wayeven if there are no easy solutions from washington or anywhere else to the problems that plague your town the fbi reopening its investigation into hillarys emails helped trump per redstate author ed klein said on the steve malzberg show that clinton was sobbing inconsolably on election night and was blaming fbi director james comey reopening the investigation as well as obama for not stopping the investigation as to why she lost theres no question that the reopening of the investigation did considerably help trump as the polls severely tightened after the announcement poll numbers showed that the vast majority of americans felt that hillary was acting in an immoral manner the spotlight was off of trumps vulgar comments towards women and his sexual assault accusers and instead the focus was on clintons private email server but clinton is leaving out one major person who is responsible for her loss hillary was a terrible candidate if clinton had been elected president she would have been the first elected president to have been the subject of numerous fbi investigations she broke the law by using her private email server to conduct official state department business and there was a lot of quid pro quo that occurred at the clinton foundation clinton is robotic and devoid of charisma with a record in politics that is short of accomplishments but rich in failure sleaze and corruption basically clinton is an obama democrat without obamas charm according to jonah goldberg she may have been the only democratic candidate that could lose to trump and the democrats wanted to coronate her from the beginning they have no one to blame but themselves for president trump the public no longer has any faith in the mediaand that includes latenight comics will rahn wrote at cbs news that the unbearable smugness of the clintonbiased media was offputting to a lot of voters as they sneered at trump supporters as stupid backward hicks while doing everything they could to prop up clinton trumps vitriol toward the press ended up benefiting him politically poll numbers reflect this as trust in the media has declined over the years rahn explains journalists increasingly dont even believe in the possibility of reasoned disagreement and as such ascribe cynical motives to those who think about things a different way we see this in the ongoing veneration of facts the ones peddled by explainer websites and data journalists who believe themselves to be curiously postideological that the explainers and data journalists so frequently get things hilariously wrong never invites the soulsearching youd think it would instead it all just somehow leads us to more smugness more meanness more certainty from the reporters and pundits faced with defeat we retreat further into our bubble assumptions left unchecked no its the voters who are wrong as a direct result we get it wrong with greater frequency out on the road we forget to ask the right questions we cant even imagine the right question we go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases the publics estimation of the press declines even further fewer than oneinthree americans trust the press per gallup which starts the cycle anew the same applies to latenight comics mollie hemingway writes in the federalist that jon stewart is partly responsible for the election of trump because of how he singlehandedly destroyed cnns crossfire resulting in a new age of hyperpolitical hyperliberal latenight comedy stewarts the daily show spawned stephen colbert john oliver trevor noah and several other lefty comics that perverted comedy into smarmy leftwing political lectures talking down to conservatives jon stewart is known for brutally deriding a show that featured people of differing views civilly discussing issues of the day writes hemingway he got that show killed and significantly strengthened the world where cultural elites engaged in groupthink mockery of those with whom they disagree the results include a further erosion of civility a decrease in americans ability to understand each other and their concerns and of all things presidentelect donald trump which all culminates into the main reason why trump was elected americans are tired of being trashed by leftist elites ben shapiro explains trump won because many americans were sick of being told that they were the racists as barack obama and his department of justice stoked race riots in major cities around the country trump won because many americans were sick of watching other americans being destroyed for their supposed intolerance for their religious beliefs for their unwillingness to label women men and men women for their support for traditional marriage or conservative political candidates trump won because many americans were tired of the medias constant harping on americas flaws we were supposedly sexist racist and homophobic americans said that they did not believe the media and they were right to do so in other words the left has been tearing down america as a country infested with intolerant prejudicial bigots who are incapable of thinking for themselves and needed to rely on them on how to live their lives the people finally had had enough so they elected the man whom they felt best stuck it to the leftist elites tags,1

journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam during hillary clintons first presidential campaign neera tanden was described as the wonk behind hillary a close associate of the clintons tanden helped shape policy for both bill and hillary then she switched to playing that role for obama while hillarys email scandal broke tanden was in charge of the center for american progress a radical leftwing group that had been described as obamas idea factory and she was chatting with john podesta the top clintonite who had founded cap podesta had cochaired the obamabiden transition project neera tanden would cochair the hillarykaine transition project under podesta who headed up hillarys presidential campaign podesta had helped shape the last eight years of national politics through obama and tanden looked forward to shaping the next eight under hillary and what did they think of hillary did they believe their defenses of her wrongdoing podesta and tanden ridiculed her associates for the coverup why didnt they get this stuff out like months ago so crazy she wondered unbelievable podesta wrote they wanted to get away with it since the early days of the email scandal weve been treated to the sordid rituals of feigned innocence the issue was a nonissue clinton surrogates were quick to assure us and even if it was no one did anything wrong the flies on the wall knew better though and now we can all be the flies on the wall away from the cameras and the briefings the clintonites held their bosses in contempt neera tanden a supposed close associate of hillary blasted her instincts as suboptimal and described her as suffering from a character problem and there was never any doubt as to what was going on tanden ridiculed cheryl mills for the mess mills fired off an email to podesta warning that obamas denial wouldnt hold up we need to clean this up he has emails from her they do not say stategov she warned obama had offered his usual denial claiming to have only learned about the scandal from the media the revelation that hillary had emailed obama from her illegal address would show that he had lied but meanwhile his people struggled to reinvent his lie by claiming that while he knew about her illegal address he didnt know that it was illegal this put his lie in line with hillarys lie there was only one problem when in doubt the clintons take refuge in the final lie that you may be able to prove that they did wrong but not that they meant to do wrong that was hillarys final email defense to the fbi spliced with claims of memory loss due to a concussion was that old sergeant schultz favorite i know nothing but that defense completely falls apart once you prove that they did know that is what the leaked emails have begun doing they are establishing that the sergeant schultz defense is utterly hollow cheryl mills knew john podesta knew barack obama knew and hillary clinton knew when obama told a lie that could easily be disproven while trying to distance himself from hillary mills quickly fired off a warning that he had better get his story straight and his people did that makes obama complicit before and after the fact he knew what hillary was doing when she was doing it and his people participated in the effort to cover it up afterward not just to protect her but to protect him hillary clinton was not a rogue actor she was part of an administration that had waged a war on transparency even media allies had dubbed it as the least transparent administration in history lies censorship and targeting whistleblowers were the norm for obama inc a new york times reporter dubbed it the greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation the washington post noted that the obama administration routinely makes a mockery of its longago pledge to establish itself as the most transparent administration in us history the ap pointed out that it more often than ever censored government files or outright denied access to them bizarre administration email dodges included epa boss lisa jackson using richard windsor as her alias jacksonwindsor left the epa and took a seat on the board of the clinton foundation tanden and podesta didnt take issue with hillary clinton breaking the law but with her clumsy political instincts her inability to fake sincere apologies and spin scandals as smoothly as obama hillarys biggest flaw in their eyes was her clumsiness at covering up acts that were routine in in obamaworld they didnt despise her because she broke the law but because she was bad at it that made her a threat to their political futures hillarys clumsy instincts led her to the point of having to admit what she did while denying having intended to do it motive is simultaneously the strongest and weakest defense you can prove what someone else did but it is hard to prove what someone else meant to do unless you have their emails this is hillarys firewall its what every painful trickle of the scandal was meant to drag out and delay every partial revelation is buying time while bringing us closer to the final breach in the motive wall what the podesta emails tell us is that they knew those around hillary knew and those around them knew that the inner circle knew they knew and they hated hillary for being a bad liar and now as the inside drama of clintonworld spills across the internet the red queen moves closer to being in check by making it all about motive hillary clinton turned personal communications particularly emails into the key instrument of culpability that is why podestas emails are such a hot commodity its why her emails are becoming an even bigger prize neera tanden was right hillary clintons political instincts are suboptimal she is the member of the obama graduating class voted least likely to be able to lie convincingly on national television and she has a perverse knack for dragging everyone around her into her scandals while exposing their own we know that her people knew that she lied we know that obama lied all thats left is her final lie,1

matters that affect their lives and their nations protesting is a universally acknowledged fact belonging to the modern world it serves to give voice to those who are disturbed by the faulty policies drawbacks and negligence of their governments and who wish to raise public awareness on these matters demonstrations rallies strikes pickets boycotts and so on are all ways of protesting as long as they are within the limits defined by the law protests and acts of similar nature are in essence an indisputable part of democracy freedom of opinion and expression however in some cases protesting is exploited and used as a means of opposing democracy itself protests that give way to riots are now methods of staging coups to shut down administrations and overthrow democratically elected governments legitimacy of protests and feasibility of demands democratic protests are welcomed by societies and addressed by governments to the extent that their demands are tangible justified and feasible protests lacking those qualities are most likely to fail in having their demands met the antigovernment movement in bulgaria in confirmed the validity of these qualities the protests took place in three separate cycles january and february witnessed rallies that objected to the high prices of electricity and demanded the government resign they were successful as the requests were sensible a later demonstration was against a government officer and resulted in his resignation yet another cycle of protests called for a change of the system along with some other illegal demands and faced defeat after turning into riots that were not supported by the overall society more gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters by shooting in their heads bombers stopped by police blew themselves up in turkey dispute over kurds and coup attempt threatens usturkey alliance the attempted coup détat made turkey band together the gezi park protests in turkey in the same year followed the same pattern set in motion with a good willed and environmentalist approach it was likely to succeed considering its solid and feasible calls and legitimate ways at first the government heeded the nature lovers voices and took a positive step by postponing a construction project that required the destruction of gezi park yet the humanist approach of young people changed course in the wake of provocations of separatist and terrorist gangs and turned into a totally different nature demonstrations that began in gezi park in istanbul and that demanded the preservation of gezi park as a recreational area spread to other cities of the country and transformed into armed and bloody uprising imposing the fall of government it was a quite clear coup detat attempt that did not refrain from using violent methods and openly rejected the validity of a democratically elected government the protests were contradictory considering people took to streets using their democratic rights but then appealed to nondemocratic methods to lay their claims ignoring the will of the nation though justified at the beginning these two cases of protests demonstrate that they are open to hostile manipulations and may lose their legitimacy if left at the hands of illminded people recently some dark powers have been using this latest technique to manage countries internal affairs as they see fit and stage coups to overthrow governments they bring in professional teams of brutal killers amidst peaceful protests which then lead to violent antidemocratic clashes these protests sometimes end up in civil wars where fellows of the same nation kill one another it all happens in the wake of a governments nonyielding to some dark powers demands and a democratically elected government faces antidemocratic attempts methods of provocations and otpor such dramatic outcomes come by the employment of social media social media becomes an instrument for organizing stirring and agitating the masses that are presumed to join the demonstrations various provocative organizations undertake the organization of some agents and provocateurs who take part in demonstrations by inciting them to get violent these illegal subcontractors organize the public relations part of the riots and channel intellectual circles of the country such as its authors academicians journalists and members of nongovernmental institutions to act against democratically elected government in the name of democracy and to lead the public one of the most common groups among these professional revolutionary organizations is a serbiabased resistance organizationotpor independent observers state that otpor organizes coup attempts and civil disturbance by providing training and logistic support for the usbacked dissident organizations in many countries such as the former yugoslavia serbia georgia bulgaria ukraine egypt brazil and turkey there is a consensus that the cia has been creating riots and social disturbances in fifty countries otpor its offshoot canvas a relevant source puts forward the following interesting findings otpor the otpor s fistlogo would turn up years later in the streets of cairo illustrating further the preposterous foreignbacked nature of the egyptian uprisings serbias otpor would continue receiving funds from the west and become a ciacoup college of sorts under the name of canvas center for applied nonviolent action and strategies the research article penned by carl gibson and steve horn and published on occupycom deals with the international financial intelligence and political connections of otpor and features the following information based on wikileaks documents serbias srdja popovic is known by many as a leading architect of regime changes in eastern europe and elsewhere since the lates and as one of the cofounders of otpor popovic and otpors offshoot canvas have also maintained close ties with a goldman sachs executive and the private intelligence firm stratfor as well as the us government such examples are easy to find the internal public opinion on otpor is that it is being employed as leverage to overthrow those governments which conflict with the interests of the us no wonder some media organizations that act on behalf of the us administration speak highly of otpor at every turn moreover the british media rigorously advocates that the executives of otpor have nothing to do with the organization of coups likewise some turkish media organizations disseminated similar statements during the gezi park demonstrations the attempt to occupy the prime ministers residence by armed groups which is an act of rebellion against the state and treason by law was orchestrated by otpor according to reports yet the media deliberately defined it as the exercise of legitimate democratic rights and freedom of expression by the people and thus desired to create misapprehension to display the members of the marxist and separatist terrorist organizations who are far from representing even a slightest portion of the nation as the representatives of the nation these media organs called the nations security forces who risked their lives to preserve public order and peoples lives as the socalled enemies of freedom and democracy in truth such mass demonstrations that aim to topple governments divide countries and organize bloody conflicts and even civil wars can no longer be called innocent rallies but subtle projects of deep states and shadow organizations to take over countries from within,0

liebrary and the truth is not misogynistic its just the truth november culture your old uncle bob is mixing things up hereand i think you will see where im going with this new angle of mine pretty quickly i have selected three sjw films to review one from the s one from the s and one of much more recent vintage from and what might all three of these insidious hollywood movies have in common why they outwardly or subliminally program viewers to blindly adopt bluepill beliefs and behaviors thats what i feel unsettlingly dirty just writing about these films but somebodys gotta do it so lets get busy here and expose these three flatout unintentional farces for what they really are seize the day onward and upward or is that downwardin this case in terms of these three horrendously blatant sjw films most definitely downward to kill a mockingbird gregory peck robert duvall brock peters mary badham this multipleoscarwinning film is based on the pulitzerprizewinning novel of the same name which was written by harper lee and published in and it is that pulitzer prize and those multiple oscars that should be your first major clues that the hollywood elitists were up to no good while crafting this brilliantly clever piece of sjw brainwashing this wickedly hypnotic movie cleverly reinforces the statistically bankrupt notion that most white males in the american deep south are vicious stupid ignorantly racist crackers who spend most of their time ruining the lives of innocent blacksthat is when they arent shooting them down like dogs or lynching them outright the plot centers around a hardworking standup straightarrow black man tom robinson brock peters who is falsely accused of rape by a conniving whitetrash slut named mayella ewell collin wilcox whose alcoholic father bob ewell james anderson is a racist pig of unfathomably low character the towns sjw lawyer atticus finch gregory peck plays white knight and comes rushing to tom robinsons defensemuch to the dismay of the local good ole boysbut despite his best efforts to free the poor wrongly accused black man finch cannot hold back the powerful tide of racist anger which ultimately results in the backwater towns killer cops shooting poor tom down in cold blood a familiar theme which can be abundantly found in todays world of dindunothin black folk who are perennially and viciously gunned down by racist white cops on an everincreasing and frightening basisyawn gee never heard this one before im not even going to get into the rest of this mindnumbing films plot and story line because its a waste of both my time and yours but i will mention a few correlative facts here which you might find just a little bit interesting the sjwcontrolled civil rights movement exploded with a vengeance not long after this film was released and heres the redpill truth of the matter according to the annual report on murder by the federal bureau of investigation most interracial murders in the usa involved black assailants and white victims with blacks murdering whites at times the rate that whites murder blacks these stunning disparities began to emerge in the mids when there was a sharp increase in black crime against white people an upsurge which not so coincidentally enough corresponds exactly with the beginning of the modern sjwcrafted civil rights movement blacks thus committed times more violent interracial crimes than whites even though the black population was only oneseventh the size of the white population at the time this is according to the survey highlights from years of surveying crime victims published in youll have to buy the book if you want to find out the real truth these days washingtons sjw datagatherers no longer keep track of such bigoted statisticsprobably because they care about our safety so very very deeply over the years the cumulative effects have been staggering justice department and fbi statistics indicate that between and more than million violent interracial crimes were committed in the usa overwhelmingly involving black offenders and white victims and more than people were killed in interracial murdersthe vast majority of them being blackonwhite killings by comparison americans died in the vietnam war and were killed in the korean war i wonder how many additional people have been killed in america during the escalation of these deliberately inflamed race wars since unfortunately we cant get a look at those statistics as previously mentioned because the puppet masters no longer keep such records so far as i can telland if they do they definitely dont want us to see them be that as it may the notions set forth in to kill a mockingbird are repulsively twisted morally insidious and patently false and if that offends anybody out there who might be reading this review that makes my entire freaking day because in the end all that should matter to any critically thinking person is the truth and what hollywood dishes out on a regular basis is anything but gandhi sir ben kingsley martin sheen candice bergen sir john gielgud supposedly as the crafters of history have quite ingeniously led us to believe mohandas k gandhi played by sir ben kingsley in this multipleoscarwinning film utilized the greatest weapon of all in his epic fight against british tyranny on behalf of the indian peoplethe incredibly effective method of nonviolent resistance and in the movie gandhi there is a sequence in the film featuring a large group of noncompliant protesters as it faces down a group of security forces armed with sticks outside of a salt factory the end result being that the protesters get the holy crap beaten out of them in reality that was basically all that happened there was a public dogandpony show shortly after this supposedly reallife event which was choreographed by the elitistowned media and indeed in this cleverly constructed movie actor martin sheen can be seen describing the bloody mayhem at the factory over the telephone to his cohorts back in the usa sheen plays american journalist vince walker in the film and what sheens character witnessed and put into words and then passed along to his editor over the phone was summarily put into print in vast numbers of elitistowned newspapers as well as on film in elitistowned news reels and marketed all over the worldwhich resulted in bringing worldwide focus on the terrorist acts of the security workers at the salt factory this entire episode was allegedly a key element of indias signature accomplishment of gaining her independence from the british despite the fact that every single major worldwide event that finds its way into the mainstream medias propaganda conduits is either a completely staged event like the indian protesters getting beaten outside the salt mine imho or something that meshes well with the elites overall master plan or they will not even put it into print or on film to begin with of the worlds major media companies are owned by just six major players we are supposed to believe that the elitistproduced film gandhi depicts reallife events that occurred as the direct result of one brave man in a loincloth who stood up to the ferocious might of the british empire and brought the entire house down singlehandedly please youd have a better chance of talking me into using tinder there is another infamous sequence in the film wherein a group of hindi demonstrators is peacefully assembling in protest within an enclosed parklike area of the indian city of amritsar the demonstrators are consequently assaulted by british soldiers who open fire brutally and randomly on the assembled sitting ducks and proceed to gun down hundreds of protesters this incident allegedly occurred on april and some estimates put the actual number of demonstrators killed at well over and in this single crucial very revealing sequence of the film the sobering truth is once again put on display for all to seeassembling peacefully going against the grain of the established order by utilizing peaceful protest and noncompliance within a group setting is exactly what the elite want the people to do because it makes it a whole lot easier to identify them and kill them in the film after the mass slaughter the soldiers commander is dressed down by his higherups for taking the law into his own hands and gunning down the peaceful demonstrators but that was all done strictly for show and this is most obviously a case of cinematic cover here as anyone who can think for themselves can easily infer who do you think produced gandhi uh that would be an elitistowned film company columbia picturesdo you really think the elite are going to pass along the bona fide solution to wiping them outuh no way last time i checked rattlesnakes dont commit suicide the british empire has a long and bloody history of usurping lands and the notion that the stringpullers at the very top of the greasy flagpole would be aghast at the actions of the british commander who ordered the slaughter at amritsar is comical at best what the slaughter at amritsar actually accomplished in addition to the massmurder of a huge swath of ardent protesters was the following with the complicit assistance of the elitistowned press the british commanders actions that day reinforced the suicidal notion that peaceful protest and nonviolent resistance were the keys to bringing about significant social change and throughout history other choreographed events like the slaughter at amritsar and the subsequent explosion of moral outrage fueled by the reports in the eliteowned media have continued to give rise to the suicidal notion that nonviolent resistance actually works which of course it does but only in isolated highprofile choreographed incidents where the outcome has already been decided beforehand whenever the puppet masters want it to appear that way to the sleeping sheepthe rest of the time it only results in massincarceration physical assault political harassment or murder on a more subtle note you might have noticed that two of the leading actors in this oscarwinning film were eventually knighted by the british empirenamely sir ben kingsley knighted in and sir john gielgud knighted in to which i can only say i rest my case your honor the gift jason bateman rebecca hall joel edgerton allison tolman i dont typically watch modern hollywood films these days mostly because i know what hollywood is up to so i normally avoid them in the exact same way that i avoid single mothers with tramp stamps or chicks with green hair but i went ahead and checked out this absolute mindfuck of a movie on showtime the other night knowing it would probably throw me a wicked sjw curveballand sure enough it didnt disappoint as an aside i threw this film into the mix juxtaposed with the previous two oscarwinners partly to demonstrate how far the bar has fallen in the hollywood filmmaking industry in terms of the standard of quality they dont even try to hide the sjw brainwashing madness in their films any longer at least back in the day they could mindfuck the sheep in an entertaining and captivating way while keeping their overall intentions under the radarbut today as this next film proves not so much simon callem jason bateman has a horrifying secret buried in his twisted past and his wife robyn rebecca hall is clueless about the whole thing innocent white female vs evil white male the usual bullshit here the couple relocates from chicago to a suburb of los angeles where they run into gordon gordo moseley joel edgerton a creepy awkward socially inept former high school classmate of simons gordo starts dropping by the couples new house uninvited and unannounced and he does so on far too many occasions simon thinks gordons behavior is weird which it is but his sjw wife thinks gordo is sweet shy and simply misunderstood gordos weirdness escalates in typical boremetodeath fashion hollywood is really great at this audiencewowing technique lately until robyn finally discovers her husbands longheld secret he bullied poor gordo back in high school by inventing a story about him which centered around a homosexual relationship that gordo never had the horrendously unfair story got back to gordos father and gordos father nearly killed him of course simons liberal sjw brainwashed wife eventually wants her bullyboy husband out of her life forever shortly after discovering this unforgivable transgression even though shes pregnant with their first child and they were very much in love up to this point yeah like that would ever happen in real life the sjw bullshit meter spikes so hard in this film that youll be left slackjawed stunned and eyerollingly incredulous and if you are unfortunate enough to have to sit through this absolutely putrid piece of garbage be sure to keep a barfbucket handy especially for the endingbecause you are definitely going to need it hopefully its getting a whole lot easier for you to spot the bullshit that is being sold not only in todays sjw hollywood films but in hollywood films of days gone by most especially oscar winners the elite are always using the magic of hollywood for nefarious purposesnamely to magically instill behaviors in its audience members that will get them into trouble or instill beliefs in them that are totally divorced from reality doing this makes it much easier to divide the moviegoing sheep and thereby conquer them typically by race or by historical beliefs or by sociopolitical beliefs so do yourself and the world a huge favor and avoid sjw hollywood films wherever and whenever you can the rule is simple if its being made in hollywood today its a bpo film blue pill only and unfortunately as it pertains to movies that were made all the way back in the early s if not even further well as we have just seen the same rule applies in many cases by boycotting hollywood films you are lessening the degree of brainwashing to which you subject yourself simply by being alive in the world at the present time and in this particular case less is most definitely more,1

publishing is not only a powerful democratic party lobbyist but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of saudi arabia no as tinfoilhat conspiracy theorist as it might sound that scenario is the absolute truth in john and tony podesta formed the podesta group and have used their bigwig partyinsider status to lobby and influence government policies while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest according to the march filing made in accordance with the foreign agents registration act of tony podesta is an active foreign agent of the saudi government with the center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court and acts as an officer of the saudi arabia account at this point the web of payforplay between the washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight for starters the podesta brothers lobbying firm receives every month from the saudi government which in no uncertain terms and despite a status as privileged us ally wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations john podesta previously served as president bill clintons chief of staff founded the think tank center for american progress which ohsocoincidentally touts the need to reframe saudi arabias hopelessly tarnished image counseled president obama and now chairs hillary clintons campaign tony podesta acts as a foreign agent for the kingdom of saudi arabia lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the kingdom while also contributing to and bundling for hillary clintons campaign think about that for a moment one brother uses the influence of money to both affect united states foreign policy and infuse the clinton campaign with cash while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities as the washington post reported months ago in july tony podestas lobbying efforts raised for the campaign and for the victory fund the saudis hired the podesta group in because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger raif badawi to ten years in prison and lashes for insulting islam alternet reported since then tony podestas fingerprints have been all over saudi arabias advocacy efforts in washington dc when saudi arabia executed the prominent nonviolent shia dissident sheikh nimr alnimr causing protests throughout the shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions the new york times noted that the podesta group provided the newspaper with a saudi commentator who defended the execution notably the saudis reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant usbacked coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict additionally tony podestas status as a registered foreign agent for saudi arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from april ironically revealed by wikileaks publishing of his brothers personal communiques in which former clinton foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director dennis cheng wrote to a small group of insiders hi all we do need to make a decision on this asap as our friends who happen to be registered with fara foreign agents registration act are already donating and raising i do want to push back a bit its my job i feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table both for primary and general and then dnc and state parties and how do we explain to people that well take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them that the foundation takes from foreign govts but we now wont either way we need to make a decision soon to which general counsel to the clinton campaign attorney marc elias replied all errors original and emphasis added responding to all on this i was not on the call this morning but i lean away from a bright line rule here it seems odd to say that someone who represents alberta canada cant give but a lobbyist for phillip morris can just as we vet lobbyists case by case i would do the same with fara while this may lead to a large number of fara registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban a total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eyerolling and ill will that it did for obama as the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaigns image with potentially controversial donors while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash becomes even more apparent as strategist and campaign manager robby mook responds where do we draw the line though elias suggests a particularly intricate solution if we do it case by case then it will be subjective we would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for in judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the united states its relationship to the state department during hillarys time as secretary and its relationship if any to the foundation in judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and hillarys past campaigns specifically put simply we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists except with a somewhat more stringent screen as a legal matter i am not saying we have to do this we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely im just offering this up as a middle ground mook eventually decides plainly marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions dont really get you anythingthat obama actually got judged more harshly as a result he convinced me soin a complete uturn im ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks are you guys ok with that all of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect despite increasing calls for the united states to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody saudi regime the us approved a stunning billion sale of smart bombs to the kingdom in november tony podestas specific contract with the governmentrun center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court which will earn million by years end does indeed suggest the infusion of a prosaudi message into the us media propaganda machine saudi arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in washington sunlight foundation spokesman josh stewart told the washington post that spans both what youd call the inside game which is lobbying and government relations and the outside game which is pr and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying that broader audience the american public has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughlycorrupt clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the saudis as well as the free thought project has repeatedly reported the evidence of collusion among the democratic national committee hillary clintons campaign and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable including no less than socalled journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet and yet at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the white house who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts the system isnt rigged its performing exactly as intended and always will as long as the vote validates its existence dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter please help spread the word

dennis system washington dc ap following the results of tuesday nights election president obama has signed executive order which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on december th obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted equipment failures as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically people all over the country have been flooding my office with calls telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers obama told reporters many have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a hillary clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as president this was especially bad in areas of florida and north carolina where there are high numbers of latino and african american voters we must investigate these claims the margin of victory is too close to call and the outcome of this election is too important there is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for trump under the presidents order the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted and all poll workers who took part in tuesdays election will be subjected to strict background checks this process is expected to take days in precincts where the department of justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred new elections will be held on dec th with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college not surprisingly donald trump is not happy with the presidents decision crooked hillary lost this election fair and square they tried to rig this election against me but the american people didnt allow that to happen president obama doesnt care about what the american people want i said the system was rigged all along and this proves i was right the president also said that the doj will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college we have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states we still need to investigate these claims but if they are true we will take all the appropriate actions necessary paul horner a professor of political science at ucla believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the united states but there is nothing in the constitution that says that hillary clinton won the popular vote by more than votes but because of the electoral college she still lost that decision is reserved solely for the electors who meet in their respective states on december th what the people are actually voting for are their states electors not for the president though the system is odd and unfair it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching that does not mean however that it will continue to work just fine in the future the way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways this recent election being one of them political analyst matt daemon told abc news that he agrees with the presidents executive order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether the electoral college is a fking joke we should be using the popular vote instead it may have made sense in but so did the three fifths compromise everyone should have an equal vote and thats just not the case with the electoral college you know what the electoral college gave us it gave us george w bush it gave us a war in iraq and the worst recession since the great depression its time to bring our system into the st century i hope obama fixes this because president trump is going to be a nightmare obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward were going to investigate the fbi into their role in all of this obama said why did fbi director james comey on sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against clinton after reviewing all of her emails declaring hillary clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election why wasnt this news released earlier how many votes were lost because of this obama said if all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in december a recount will be ordered if you have any questions about the recount or the special december th election you can call the obama administrations special election hotline at tags,0

years ago gait is a married mother of five and longterm american resident in britain her support of the prolife movement is driven by thankfulness and praise for life and her christian faith witnessing abortions heavy toll on the living and dead gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing subtle and working entirely with symbolism these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion rather they mourn in color symbol and tone with single shoes broken cord dead flowers and other lonely and broken things troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x when a friend first visited gaits studio he was struck by her abortion paintings confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child he wrote i realize your work comes from a place of great love for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child it happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby five years to the day father x remembers every detail their conversation grew into a joint effort culminating in a book troubadours sailing hibiscus seas meditations on post abortion trauma father x wanted to remain anonymous as a placesetter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion he wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of gaits paintings in this book which have also been shown together in art exhibits time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion gait claims rather the past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence guilt and remorse has not abated you can see that in the words of father x which run the gamut of human emotions on abortion shoe pot and crossesfrom troubadours sailing hibiscus seas jonah of nineveh features an upended single rose with red cords and funereal foliage flowers are already in the birth position head down and waiting to be born torn and shroudlike ribbons hang across the painting spirals represent a childs dna helix and the veil of the temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation father x makes an analogy between jonah fleeing parental responsibility and eventual redemption then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness it was her wedding dress my sea green empress this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives she was full of fear in some of these works hammers incongruently hang with flowers they are bloody or blackened some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose father x interprets these tools as decision markers to either build or tear down in hammer of decision it belongs to thor the war god infested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction wagner the olympics sperm races thomas moore and valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author either the carpenters hammer of wisdom or thors tool of chaos will be chosen by expectant parents hammer suspended troubadours runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities this includes moonlighting for angels celestial games interstellar windjammers and a baby steamer sailing on childrens seas among other delightful prospects lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their limbos father x occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters these are not theological statements but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion in gaits pink rose and stardust we see empty fields withered plants and other tokens father x takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children he places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles which is reflected in the painting children are disfigured or missing eyes or arms and singing in low mournful tones so as not to disturb their parents music is intense equivalent to the sound created by hildegard von bingen a thcentury nun and composer troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x references to mary as a mother are common as well as other scriptural allusions all babies jump for jesus in the womb or in its sack of nibbling yoke writes father x elizabeths child john leapt for joy just as his ancestor david did before the ark of the covenant he continues gait addresses the human embryo finding biblical ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages her abbey target beginning has a crosshair target which is interpreted spiritually the first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread the bread on fire with the holy spirit the same stage of development as the child in marys womb when she arrived at her cousin elizabeths house postabort guilt isnt rationalized or downplayed but emotionally reacted to in art and word father x describes bats as whirling about in circles at the pitiful sound the aborted children make because they are tuned to such distressing signals this contrasts with many parents who are still stone deaf to such mournful sounds at another point fatherx imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus a roar of unwanted thoughts troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x father x elaborates on what gait hints in her paintings the injustice and evil of abortion he cites a world built on slavery before christs advent and the works of such men as william wilberforce and john brown in furthering christs gospel of justice and peace all this is contrasted to abortion throughout ruminating on gaits palms of our lord father x claims the face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion palms is murky with a single red hand print to look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the tarot of ruins he continues suicide advances this dark theme where gait and father x criticize the death industry and its euphemistically named clinics he takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings a caricature of a woman who made a mistake who got herself in trouble who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart but all isnt baleful and sad here in cloud children father x muses on paper dolls in gaits paintings with this lovely thought where children go is a mystery some say they take their daytime rest in christs tomb in jerusalem and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled star ships troubadours sailing hibiscus seas is a work of meditation grief counseling poetry social commentary and visual art father x may not reveal his identity here but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child gait and father x describe their efforts as a silent prayer of witness for all the ghost families those phantoms of sorrows who will never laugh or cry together as a family because of an abortion they hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way judith gait is a graduate of california college of arts and crafts

mean it means that simpsons prediction came true httpswwwthesuncouknewsthesimpsonscorrectlypredictedadonaldtrumppresidencyyearsagoinepisodesetinthenearfuture so now you know who to refer to for accurate predictions about the future goodbye tarot cards et al in i recall reading a survey which concluded that america was not likely to be ready for a woman president for the next twenty years twentyone years later it looks like that prediction was true given that women in america to this day are paid of what men are paid it is not surprising that americans find it tough to visualize a woman in the white house in any place other than the presidents bed so what does trump mean for america for american muslims for muslims worldwide for nonwhites in america and globally i am asking this rhetorical question as i see all kinds of doomsday predictions flying around i apologize for taking a different view i see the trump presidency as an opportunity for those who believe in the opposite of everything that donald trump promoted in his campaign to put their actions where their mouths are and show that they are as willing to stand up for what they believe in as he was what does trump mean for america i hope he will be the best thing that happened to america ever i hope that he can truly make america great again i say that because though i am not american should i say thank god i am one who believes that a truly great america can make this world great the world truly needs to change we need someone to lead the way to make the world compassionate caring fighting against injustice corruption and poverty disease and ignorance which nation is better suited to lead that fight america has the resources the intelligence the education and the leadership ability which i hope it chooses to exercise trump won on the antiestablishment platform i support that fully the establishment has shown that what it can do is to fail spectacularly the economy crashed and obama rewarded those who crashed it people were and are homeless when there are empty homes on foreclosed loans enough for every american to have two homes not only one yet they are on the streets i hope trump can put americans back in their own homes bush father and son started never ending wars obama continued them adding his own flavor to it of drone strikes using technology to create bug splats the arrogance is incredible thereby escalating the global threat level that comes from driving people to desperation obamas dabbling what else to call it in middle eastern politics resulted in continuing the misery for people of afghanistan and iraq and new misery for people of syria and by inference for the rest of the world and to top it all isis came into being because of all of the above the credit can be shared by all of them so trump standing against the establishment means that he is against all of this i sincerely hope so all the jingoism that he rode on will get tempered when it comes to facing reality it is easy to talk about kicking out the mexicans and so on but the day he does that reality will dawn on him and his cohorts like it did on those who voted probrexit that the rich need the poor to survive while the poor dont need the rich when nice white americans get to pay per potato they will realize the value of cheap labor meanwhile some contractor will get the contract to build the wall which he will do from the mexican side no doubt as otherwise his margin will not make it worthwhile so also the wonderful idea to outlaw the h visa i dont think it will take very long for trump and his gang to realize that there is a reason there are blond jokes and that indians are not blond go figure that the good news is that trump made public what was private racism misogyny in a country that never stops trumpeting about womens equality support for genocide wars and weapons sales the evils of unbridled capitalism lockerroom conversations which indicate attitudes have all come out of the closet and lockerroom now it is up to those who like to say that they believe in the opposite of all these things to get off their backsides and bring about change they can no longer live the lives of pretense and lies that they had become used to saying it is not happening here trump proved that it is happening and has trumpeted it from the top of trump tower sorry for so much bad punning in one breath but there you go as for muslims and trump believe me trump is far better than what muslims have seen in the past he is far better than what we have today take sisi the oily royals who are personal friends of every weapons dealer the paki leadership and i can think of several more and trump begins to look like a choir boy what will he do that is not already happening frankly i dont know and dont care to speculate because the prime movers behind muslim affairs and how they are are muslims themselves our leadership or more correctly its spectacular failure ordinary citizens pay the price but whats new about that the fact remains that until we sort that out and do something about taking charge of our destiny we must remain satisfied with others writing the script we are compelled to live by play endings depend on the script not on the players india is a classic example where a socalled minority of million is kicked around like a football and used at will by every mercenary politician for his own ends but indian muslims seem to be satisfied with that so who is anyone else to complain if you disagree and tell me that they are not satisfied then i must ask you what it is that prevents them from doing what is glaringly obvious get their act together change their leaders and write their own script million is not a minority it is a nation but only if it chooses to be same story for muslims globally no point in blaming trump or looking up to him to find solutions it is our problem and we must solve it so let us start doing that two other points what about wars global warming and such issues well when you have a nation that lives on perpetual warfare and is supported in that by all the other major industrial nations who either manufacture and sell weapons or buy them how can you pin it all on trump if weapons are made and sold there will be wars wars will happen if they continue to make profits for those who run them that people die is incidental those at the top who laugh all the way to the bank dont those that do dont count they are collateral who are necessary to prove the efficacy of the weapons that were used to vaporize them if it wasnt for the bugs who splatted how would you assess the drones or their operators the fact that the bugs were innocent or that they had families and so on well bugs are bugs and thats all that there is to it global warming america decided on that when it chose bush instead of al gore for a minute i thought that was because they got confused because his name is al gore like al ghurair but then i realized that it was because he had a terminal problem he had a brain see his famous movie an inconvenient truth and you will see what i mean httpswwwalgorecomlibraryaninconvenienttruthdvd if you do nothing else buy this and see it at least you will know why you died since you chose that especially americans i believe it is only fair that you understand what you did with trump that came out in the open so get used to summer all year long you wont need to go to the french riviera for a tan you can get it at home that is not inconvenient add to this the effect ofunending wars refugee movement changing cultures security nightmares coming true widening gap between the rich and the poor global poverty and hunger preventable disease which is not prevented because theres no profit in it when i think about all this and trumps election nero comes to mind renewing our link with tradition let us dance to the tune whats the use of fiddling otherwise final question that everyone is asking how safe is it to have someone like trump with his finger on the nuclear button my answer is the one who actually pressed that button was as different from trump as could be yet he did it let me leave you to figure out the rest meanwhile it is midnight where i live far away from trump and america and time to go to bed truly it is said that there is solace in sleep so good night world sleep

joined wnd in after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law alabamas judges are elected and accountable wrote justice tom parker this week federal judges as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v hodges a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to samesex marriage are unaccountable and unelected he pointed out that three of the four dissenting us supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were consequently unaccountable parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning history tradition the courts own rules or the rule of law but upon their empathetic feelings obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges he said he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriagebased case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case which created samesex marriage nationwide was announced moore who is challenging the punishment insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves they did with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments parker said active judges should have been included in the panel because retired judges too are unelected and unaccountable unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda instead of faithfully applying the rule of law parker warned obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided obergefell the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states dont miss phyllis schlaflys book now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family before obergefell states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in of those states the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account citing the situation that developed in iowa the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa however although the judges are initially appointed they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law in april in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional the very next year three of the judges who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa this was the first time since iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law mathew staver chairman of of liberty counsel which is representing moore said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law he said the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every turn this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the vote never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart who has been acting as alabamas chief justice she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary they will no doubt take our complaint seriously as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore said tom ford a spokesman for the group the complaints the group said outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety failed to perform the duties of her office impartially failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary daniel horowitz senior editor at conservative review told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues whether its the bureaucrats whether its the courts and as it relates to even religious liberty even property rights immigration our voting rights who gets to vote he said horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america how did we get here horowitz asked rhetorically and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges the legal profession and unelected bureaucrats that is social transformation without representation which as scalia warned is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in by the bare majority made up of anthony kennedy ruth ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan john roberts clarence thomas samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it the majority found in the constitution a right to samesex marriage overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the us supreme court majority for one two of the justices in the majority kagan and ginsburg were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality without their votes the case would have gone the other way they refused then there was the us supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier in the defense of marriage act case in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people as wnd reported ginsburg who voted in favor of samesex marriage has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements justice elena kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case but they refused to acknowledge the request the foundation explained that canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court usc sec a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned rabbi jonathan cahn author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah judgment movie has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning a nation at war against its own foundation washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained justices can you judge the ways of god there is another court and there is another judge where all men and all judges will give account he warned if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal he said see jonathans cahns message at washington man of prayer event at the

months since the word zika flashed like a lightning bolt in the headlines of mainstream news before january zika was just one of many viruses that public health officials monitored but suddenly in january of this year everything changed as a nearly harmless virus was transformed into a worldwide threatarticle by john p thomas republished from healthimpactnewscom as we will see the zika propaganda machine was turned on in october of and it has been running wild ever since this is a classic example of a mind control program a public brainwashing project or a high powered marketing campaignregardless of what you call it it is clear that the mainstream news media the world health organization who the pan american health organization paho the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc big pharma big chem and both republicans and democrats have joined forces to sell a zika eradication program to the people of the united states and to the rest of the worldthis has been and continues to be one of the best orchestrated programs of propaganda in recent history this article will discuss how the program started how it has been developed and where it is going zika is not a threat to the babies of the world just to be absolutely clear from the beginning there is no solid evidence that zika is a threat to humanity it is a minimally dangerous viral infection which does not cause microcephalyin the almost years since the zika virus was patented by the rockefeller foundation no one ever noticed any association between zika infection of pregnant women and their babies being born with abnormally small heads or with defects in brain development but in we were suddenly made aware of this supposed problem this claim based on nothing more than circumstantial evidence was the beginning point for the propaganda campaign a propaganda claim doesnt need to be true it just needs to be repeated over and over again until people believe it is trueafter half a year of fear and hysteria in the mainstream media even officials in brazil admit that zika is an unlikely cause of their microcephaly as reported in nature news comment on july an official from brazils ministry of health raises doubts to suggest zika is not the only factor in the reported microcephaly surge in his country the report stated zika virus has spread throughout brazil but extremely high rates of microcephaly have been reported only in the countrys northeast although evidence suggests that zika can cause microcephaly the clustering pattern hints that other environmental socioeconomic or biological factors could be at play we suspect that something more than zika virus is causing the high intensity and severity of cases says fatima marinho director of information and health analysis at brazils ministry of health if that turns out to be true it could change researchers assessment of the risk that zika poses to pregnant women and their children despite this admission from brazil the zika propaganda campaign is moving ahead without interruption the campaign will not be stopped by contrary evidence about zika and microcephaly zika is a mild viral infection most people who get zika will be completely unaware of being infected for those who do get sick it is similar in many ways to having a cold or a mild case of the flu people experience fever rash joint pain and conjunctivitis the illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week infection is thought to provide lifelong immunity severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon deaths are rare the fact that almost no one dies from zika infection made it a very unlikely candidate for the development of a vaccine for those who actually feel sick from a zika infection they can receive comfort care and rest while their immune systems overcome the viral illness zika press releases set the stage for a propaganda campaign however if zika could be connected to some other horrible consequence such as microcephaly or paralysis guillainbarre syndrome for example then people would insist that we create a zika vaccine and would insist that every person on planet earth take it they would be willing to give up basic individual freedoms for the benefit of society which is always the goal of mind control programsin a number of press releases and reports were released by the pan american health organization world health organization pahowho and the cdc to set the stage for the unfolding of a grand mind control projectthe documents they published raised the red flag of alarm that a zika epidemic was unfolding throughout south america and mexico the conventional media got excited about the epidemic when they saw the word microcephaly the prospect of large numbers of babies being born with abnormally small heads and brains was a story that would really grab the attention of their audiencethe media used pictures of deformed babies to build fear in the hearts of people and to create the perception that we better watch out or zika is going to get us and our babies they worked really hard to instill public panic about zika in january and february of in the timeline that follows you will see the word autochthonous public health agencies use the word autochthonous to say that an infection was locally generated an autochthonous case of zika is one that was acquired in the local area where a person lives this is in contrast with a zika infection that was acquired while visiting another region or countryi will list a few of the key points from some press releases to show how a foundation for the zika campaign was built and how momentum was established to project the campaign into mainstream media may brazil confirms first autochthonous cases of zika october columbia confirms first autochthonous cases of zika october brazil reports unusually high number of babies with microcephaly november el salvador guatemala mexico paraguay suriname and venezuela report autochthonous zika infection november who calls upon member states to watch for the occurrence of microcephaly december pahowho issued the first of dozens of reports which chronicled the history of the growing zika epidemic and warned of microcephaly december who reports autochthonous zika infections in honduras december who reports autochthonous zika infections in panama december us cdc reports autochthonous zika infections in puerto rico and makes note of microcephaly in brazil counting babies with microcephaly the mainstream media suddenly picked up on the zikamicrocephaly story in january of and began sensationalizing it general concern was quickly transformed into alarm as officials in brazil reported a steady increase in the number of microcephaly cases as of january they reported cases of microcephaly andor central nervous system cns malformation suggestive of congenital infection they compared this with data where there was an average of microcephaly cases the brazil data about the babies was poor we didnt know their definition of microcephaly we didnt know how many of the mothers actually tested positive for zika we didnt know how the data was collected we also didnt know why there was a strong level of insistence that the only thing that could cause these birth defects was infection with the zika virus propaganda campaigns always dismissed other viewpoints other than the one being promoted they dont want an investigation of truth or a debate about the facts they just want belief and submission the us propaganda machine goes public in january cdc officials begin to ponder the situation first they say there might be an association between zika and microcephaly but they are far from asserting any kind of causative relationship good for them i thought when i heard that report but their apparent wisdom took a nosedive a minute later when the same cdc official went on to issue a travel warning to women to avoid traveling to brazil and other south american countries if they are pregnant think they might be pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant in the next couple yearswhat did the cdc just say there is no evidence of causation and we dont even know there is even a problem but women should stay home any way strange i thought as i began to remember how the conventional media the cdc and the who hyped up the african ebola epidemic in a similar kind of propaganda campaign just months earlier the worldwide threat of ebola zaire completely died out long before a vaccine could be developed which must have been a major disappointment to big pharmabut this time they have a virus that is not going to die out this time their propaganda campaign will be much more sophisticated and it will make major steps toward the acceptance of universal mandatory vaccination for diseases such as zika a false international crisis involving deformed babies justifies action all through january and early february of the news media provided us with a nonstop litany of stories about zika and deformed babies in a previous article i examined some of the headlines in the propaganda campaignthe cdc was still using the word possible association while the news media insisted on using the word cause despite the initial reserve of the cdc the news media began to shout the message across america zika is going to deform the heads of our babies while they are in the womb and theres no vaccine to protect usit seems like every zika story i saw included at least one photo of a baby with microcephaly and always stated that there is no vaccine yet we were reminded over and over again that zika is causing babies to be born with abnormally small heads mental retardation and blindness we were warned that some babies were dying at birth because of the severity of their brain deformation we were told that each baby born with microcephaly will cost ten million dollars or more in medical expenses during the childs life these stories created ever increasing levels of apprehension and fear as they were intended to doas the mainstream media struggled to keep the fear level high and keep the story line flowing from week to week they began to focus in on government efforts to save us from zika it didnt take long for them to find people to interview who would ask the question they wanted asked what is the government going to do to protect our babies this question was asked over and over again even though there was no proof that zika infection and microcephaly were related the question was asked so many times by the media that no politician could dare to say i am not going to do anything because as far as we know zika doesnt cause microcephaly president obama responds to the question on february president obama requested billion dollars to study the situation and to develop a zika vaccine lets look at this more carefully we are going to spend billion dollars to develop a vaccine for a virus that almost never kills anyone and has not been proven to cause birth defects just to be safe or is something else going on hereperhaps the real story is that big pharma wants another cash cow vaccine and the zika threat has been promoted in such a way that people will insist that big pharma develop a zika vaccine for us suddenly big pharma companies will be able to put on their white hats and rescue all the babies of the world this would be such sweet deception if they could pull it off cdc declaration zika causes microcephaly the cdc announced in april of that zika causes microcephaly this decision was based on a cdc analysis of available data they did not conduct comprehensive research they used a quacking duck kind of analysis if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck then it must be a duck they couldnt tell if it had feathers like a duck or has a bill like a duck but they still insisted on calling it a duck named zika in doing this they ignored some of the most important criteria in their analysiscdc researchers stated the seventh of shepards criterion proof in an experimental system that the agent acts in an unaltered state is aimed at medications or chemical exposures and does not apply to infectious agents thus given shepards criteria as a framework criteria and have been satisfied evidence that is considered sufficient to identify an agent as a teratogen in other words they used a set of seven criteria to determine whether zika could be considered to be a cause of microcephaly they determined that the association between zika infection and microcephaly was causative for of the criteria they suggested that additional study was needed before of the other criteria could be met they excluded the seventh criteria altogether because it examined whether medications or chemicals might have caused microcephalyi couldnt believe that they excluded the seventh criteria when it is clear that microcephaly is known to be caused by pesticide exposure and could just as easily be caused by vaccinations during pregnancy as it was likely to be caused by zika infectionthese cdc scientists were only looking for causation from infectious agents nothing else seemed to matter this exclusionary mindset was present since the very beginning of the zika propaganda campaignthey ignored the effect of the tdap vaccine given to pregnant women in brazil in they ignored the side effects of medications they ignored the consumption of gmo food glyphosate and pyriproxyfen that were widely used in brazil they ignored chemical exposure from brazils large chemical manufacturing facilities they ignored alcohol and drug use they ignored the effects of extreme multigenerational nutritional deficiencies and extreme poverty they ignored the introduction of genetically modified mosquitoes that were released in brazil they ignored exposure to rubella toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus they ignored the combined effects of all these factors as well as multigenerational modifications to the local gene pool from these potential causesi discussed these potential causes of microcephaly in my first article on zika published in january of there is one key point that i want to bring forward from the previous article concerning the number of babies born with microcephaly first we heard that there were some cases of microcephaly in brazil after the initial shock and panic was produced we learned that further investigation showed that the number of confirmed cases was only the mainstream media also didnt mention that the number of babies born in the united states with microcephaly in a typical year is when adjusting for population differences between the us and brazil we find that the rate of microcephaly in the us is actually times higher than the rate in brazilin other words the us microcephaly incidence is much higher than brazil and our babies didnt get it from zika maybe our babies got it from the various potential causes i discussed in my previous articlei should also state that the researchers who put their names on this article are all employees of the cdc i must question whether their analysis was truly objective and whether their findings were influenced by cdc ties to big pharma the zika vaccine is in the pipeline based on this single poor quality analysis its full speed ahead for developing a zika vaccine there are at least four companies plus the cdc working on a zika vaccine we are told that it will still take several years before a zika vaccine can be properly tested and made available in large quantities for the population of the worldzika vaccine trials have already begun and they are already recruiting volunteers in the us the us national institutes of health hopes to start phase ii trials of its vaccine in early congress tries to protect our babies with zika funding now that the cdc has settled the zikamicrocephaly question it was time to get congress to fund the presidents request for a zika vaccine development program the house and the senate passed zika funding bills however they have different ideas of how much money should be spent and how the funds should be generated the funding process stalled at the end of june when the senate and house could not reconcile their differences congress went on a seven week summer vacation and wasnt available to try to resolve their differences this created a problem for the zika mind control campaign because it might mean there would be no new zika news to report during the summer keeping the propaganda campaign going by killing mosquitoes the mainstream media switched their focus from vaccine development to eradication of the aedes aegypti mosquito which is known to carry the zika virus if an infected mosquito bites a person then the person might develop the infection this is a fact that no one is disputing the great mosquito chase of the cdc continues to count the number of zika cases in the us and puerto rico the numbers continue to rise through the spring and early summer they were looking for autochthonous cases of zika in the us but they could only find infected people who had traveled to zika infected countries or who had sex with people who traveled to those countriesfinally at the very end of july people in the wynnewood section of miami florida were found to have zika even though they had not traveled to a zika infected country or had sex with a zika infected person public health officials at the state and federal level interpreted the presence of these cases to mean that zika must have been transmitted to these people by mosquito bites they ignored the possibility that the infected people might have been lying about their exposure for example having sexual contact with an infected person nevertheless officials concluded that they must implement a strong mosquito control program to prevent zika from spreading any furthernow that the zika epidemic was on us home soil the media had another fear inducing story to add to their propaganda campaign there are mosquitoes that are out to get you and our babies the governor of florida goes door to door to find more people with zika on august st the governor of florida contacted the us public health system and asked them to send a specially trained squad of federal public health agents to help with the zika emergency in miami these agents and florida officials went door to door in the wynwood neighborhood of miami and collected urine samples to identify additional cases of zika more cases were found but all were asymptomatic the people didnt even know they were infected problem they cant find a zika infected mosquito mosquitoes were tested for the presence of zika but all tests were negative officials dismiss the negative infection results by saying that finding a zika infected mosquito is like finding a needle in a haystack aerial mosquito spraying program initiated the governor of florida in conjunction with federal public health agents decided that they needed to do aerial spraying of pesticide even though the aedes aegypti mosquito wouldnt travel more than feet from its birth place in the wynwood neighborhood where the autochthonous zika cases were located the officials decided to spray a ten square mile area just to be safe a spraying program that covers ten square miles would make a sensational story in the media it would be much more alarming than a story about a neighborhood aerial spray zone it also would expose many more people to a toxic pesticide more about that laterthe first aerial spraying took place on august toxic pesticide used in aerial spraying causes microcephaly officials told the public not to worry about the pesticide that was being sprayed because it naled is harmless they pointed to epa reports which supported their claim they didnt mention that naled was banned in europe in they didnt mention that officials in puerto rico recently refused to allow the spraying of naled over their citizens they didnt mention that naled kills many other types of insects and aquatic creatures in addition to mosquitoes most importantly official didnt mention that naled and the chemicals that are created when it breaks down in the environment have the potential for causing human birth defects could pesticide naled cause microcephaly and other life threatening diseases officials didnt mention that the pesticide that they were spraying over the densely populated minority neighborhood of wynwood was particularly dangerous for babies in the wombthis is what the journal of pesticide reform has to say about naled like all organophosphates naled dibrom is toxic to the nervous system symptoms of exposure include headaches nausea and diarrhea naled is more toxic when exposure occurs by breathing contaminated air than through other kinds of exposure in laboratory tests naled exposure caused increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning naleds breakdown product dichlorvos another organophosphate insecticide interferes with prenatal brain development in laboratory animals exposure for just days during pregnancy when the brain is growing quickly reduced brain size percent dichlorvos also causes cancer according to the international agency for research on carcinogens in laboratory tests it caused leukemia and pancreatic cancer two independent studies have shown that children exposed to household nopest strips containing dichlorvos have a higher incidence of brain cancer than unexposed children emphasis added naled exposure causes increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning these are some of the symptoms that are also found in children on the autism spectrumone of the most toxic break down products in naled is dichlorvos this chemical caused a reduction in brain size in pregnant lab animals after days of exposure another word for reduced brain size is microcephalyso the pesticide they are spraying could increase the rate of autism among children in the spray zone and could cause microcephaly to occur in the babies of pregnant womenquestion if there are babies born in miami with microcephaly in the next nine months or if the autism rate in the spray zone increases will we blame zika or naled i am sure that no one from the cdc or from a public health agency will ever point a finger at naled they will use the children to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that zika is to blame naled is also harmful to adults dr naresh kumar a professor of public health at the university of miami commented about the risks of using pesticides in aerial spraying his statement came from cbs miami all are a neurotoxin meaning it will directly affect our nervous system it will affect not only the pregnant woman it is also equally for children who have asthma and airway disease because when you are spraying in the air these aerosols stay in the air for at least five days the miami herald provided this advice to people in the pesticide spray zone they stated the agency epa says the insecticide poses no risk for the majority of people but those sensitive to chemicals may want to stay inside during spraying close windows and turn off window air conditioners fruits and vegetables should also be washed before eating and outdoor furniture and grills covered so if you are concerned about being exposed to the chemicals they are spraying then you should stay inside for days until the pesticide falls out of the air you should keep your windows closed and turn off window air conditioners i wonder how many people were able to follow this advice in the subtropical urban climate of miami in augustmind control programs always try to make life difficult for those who live outside the box of normality they want us to follow their instructions which in this case would be to just not worry about the spraying if you are concerned then you can take their ridiculous suggestions which wont really protect you from the spray does zika also cause guillainbarre syndrome apparently the cdc suspects that zika causes the paralytic syndrome called guillainbarre if you look at the data collection forms for monitoring zika in the us you will see another masterful stroke of mind control in the making they are counting cases of guillainbarre syndrome on the same form with cases of zika why would the cdc try to make this connection the cdc indicates on their guillainbarre syndrome page that they are not sure what causes this syndrome they do mention that there were some cases of guillainbarre syndrome associated with the swine flu vaccine in but otherwise the condition is rare with unknown etiology if they can make a case for the zika virus being the cause of guillainbarre syndrome then they will shift attention away from the fact that many vaccines and pesticides have a harmful effect on the human nervous system and are able to produce this type of paralysisi anticipate seeing a guillainbarre syndrome research paper just like the one produced by the cdc on microcephaly their new paper will just substitute the phrase guillainbarre syndrome for the word microcephaly they will show through statistical smoke and mirrors that the zika virus is causative for guillainbarre syndrome as well as microcephalyif they can pull this off then the zika virus will be blamed for all cases of vaccine damage in which microcephaly or paralysis results if they can pull this off and i suspect they will then pesticide manufacturers will also be able to blame the zika virus for microcephaly neurological malformation and paralysis that results from the use of their products the zika virus will be the perfect scapegoat the list of birth defects being blamed on zika with no evidence is increasing propaganda campaigns always seek to worsen the devastating effects of whatever they want us to fear first we heard that zika causes microcephaly then we heard that it might also cause guillainbarre syndrome now we are hearing that zika causes a whole host of other birth defects some of which might not appear until months or even years after birththe new york times stated the images of babies with microcephaly published tuesday in the journal radiology also suggest a grim possibility because some of the damage was seen in brain areas that continue to develop after birth it may be that babies born without obvious impairment will experience problems as they grow images of another baby girl show contracted hands and arms the result of another common symptom zika seems to damage the nerves in a developing fetus so that sometimes muscles arent developing normally because they dont have the nerve impulses to move normally she dr levine said with such a vicious and unpredictable virus its key to realize that zika is more than microcephaly that theres a number of other abnormalities as theyve shown in this paper and its effects are going to be even more broad said dr spong whose agency has begun a study of what will ultimately be babies born in zika epidemic areas including brazil and puerto rico its going to be essential to follow them to look at their development to look at their ability to learn to look at hearing problems balance problems behavior problems all those issues to make sure that we dont miss anyone zika the new scapegoat for all childhood diseases can you tell where this is going it seems to me that they are planning to put together a catalog of major injuries that results from zika infectionit will include most if not all injuries that result from vaccines pesticides gmo food pharmaceutical drugs the highcarbohydrate lowfat standard american diet and anything else that might lead to a successful lawsuit against big pharma or big chem zika might just become the standard defense for suit against corporations it wasnt our product that harmed this little baby it was zika conclusion another government tool for the greater good to strip away freedoms it wont be long before the mainstream media will be showing us pictures of us babies from florida who were born with microcephaly the mainstream media will tug at our heartstrings and will remind us that this horror will soon become preventable when the zika vaccine is developedwe will hear about more and more connections between zika and other terrible health conditions experienced by children we will be told that all this suffering and all this expense will be avoided when all the mosquitoes are killed and everyone receives the zika vaccinemind control programs always talk about the greater good and how individuals must give up their individual freedoms their rights and even their preferences for the sake of the collective benefit zika will be one of the tools used by mind controllers and the ruling elite to move us toward mass vaccination and total government control over our livesread more at healthimpactnewscom zika

clinton goes down lynchs career will go down with her heck maybe theyll even be cellmates loretta lynchs ties to the clintons go back to when thenpresident bill clinton appointed her to run the brooklyn us attorneys office she left in and went into private practice but returned to the brooklyn office in at the behest of president barack obama heres her official bio in she was sworn in to become the rd attorney general of the united states taking the place of the blatantly corrupt attorney general eric holder who will probably be most famous for his roles in the fast and furious operation inciting racial tensions and his mishandling of the lois lernerirs debacle first there was the secret airplane meeting with bill clinton it all started to publicly go downhill for lynch during the first investigation into hillary clintons carelessness with national secrets via her home email server right before fbi director james comey was to meet with hillary clinton to interrogate her about the subject lynch was busted having a secret meeting with bill clinton the washington post reported clintons private unplanned meeting with attorney general loretta e lynch at the phoenix airport last week coming at a time when the justice department should be nearing completion of its examination of hillary clintons use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state will inevitably and negatively affect public attitudes about that investigation lynch has tried to make amends though not without leaving some confusion in her wake in a conversation friday with washington post editorial writer jonathan capehart at the aspen ideas festival she insisted again that the conversation was innocent about grandchildren and golf and such and did not touch on the investigation of the emails but she said she recognized that others would not see it that way the fact that the meeting that i had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that i take seriously and deeply and painfully she said lynch said that she would be accepting whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and fbi director james b comey bring her though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case she also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public of course it was all much easier for lynch to abide by the decision when comey miraculously found that hillary clinton was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets now though people are asking questions about that illfounded meeting judicial watch has filed a lawsuit for all records related to the illicit meeting between attorney general lynch and former president bill clinton on june attorney general loretta lynch is reported to have met privately with former president bill clinton on board a parked private plane at sky harbor international airport in phoenix arizona the meeting occurred during the thenongoing investigation of mrs clintons email server and mere hours before the benghazi report was released publicly involving both mrs clinton and the obama administration judicial watch filed a request on june that the us department of justice office of the inspector general investigate that meeting republican presidential nominee donald trump suggested that during that meeting bill clinton may have offered to extend lynchs position in the ags office during a hillary clinton administration then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious iranian ransom payment last week ag lynch blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the obama administration made to iran by pleading the fifth the washington free beacon reported attorney general loretta lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of congress about the obama administrations secret efforts to send iran billion in cash earlier this year prompting accusations that lynch has pleaded the fifth amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the washington free beacon it is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the peoples elected representatives in congress about an important national security issue the lawmakers wrote your staff failed to address any of our questions and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue as the united states chief law enforcement officer it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries they stated the actions of your department come at time when iran continues to hold americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison how very judicial of her lynch tried to shut comey up about the new investigation into the clinton emails now even the mainstream media cant turn its head earlier i wrote about the fact that fbi director james comey made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the hillary clinton emails but lets talk a little further about lynchs desperate attempts to shut him up the new york times reported that the justice department strongly discouraged comey against releasing the information the day before the fbi director james b comey sent a letter to congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed hillary clinton email investigation the justice department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy three law enforcement officials said on saturday senior justice department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter officials said but they did everything short of it pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections how interesting that its seen as influencing the election to investigate someone now but it wasnt back when she was investigated and not charged im not sure exactly how that works but according to usa today emphasis mine a federal official familiar with comeys decision said saturday that the fbi director considered the attorney generals advice during a spirited discussion of the matter thursday and early friday but felt compelled to act do you remember janet reno poor janet was another attorney general who went down for the clintons she was also sworn in as ag under bill clinton and many questioned her appointment at the time according to a report in the chicago tribune she arrived in washington from miami as caesars wife and so she has remained she was ignorant and independent of insider dc and has stayed that way bill clinton never much liked her and never confided in her and she reciprocated she became ag just in time to take the fall for the debacle in waco actually according to historycom the waco standoff had already begun by the time janet reno became the first female attorney general on march she approved the fbis tear gas plan the following month explaining that negotiations with the branch davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk we will never know whether there was a better solution reno said in everyone involved made their best judgments based on all the information we had nonetheless a republicanled congressional report called her decision premature wrong and highly irresponsible she was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements the tribune post continued to discuss renos position as a scapegoat every day since she took office she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to clintonwhitewater fundraising lewinsky china espionage etc clinton cant afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her but no such attorney general could have survived the clinton scandals much less survived them with her own reputationand her departmentsintact attorney generals who have anything to do with the clintons dont seem to fare too well they end up so embroiled in clinton scandals that they too are pulled down into the mire regardless of what their intentions were when they started out lynch can see her futureand it has something to do with help wanted ads the last time lynch was involved in the clinton email kerfuffle she promised to abide by fbi director james comeys recommendation i wonder if shell make that same promise this time she really cant because if she does it will show she was complicit with the clintons the last time around and also this time when she decried comeys release of information about the investigation i wonder if she and hillary clinton will be able to get adjoining cells whenif the truth comes out courtesy of daisy luther dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter please help spread the word by sharing

greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam a generation ago the communist tyranny in cuba demanded that the united nations condemn america for the embargo the brutal castro regimes rant accused the united states of threatening nuclear annihilation countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders on a cold day in october the european leftwing activist serving as un ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the us at the un un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain samantha power said thank you she added acknowledging the applause under obama the united states would no longer defend the united states a generation ago the communists had been in cuba now they were in washington dc instead of defending america obamas chosen representative agreed that our communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy let me be among the first to acknowledge as our cuban counterparts often point out that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust she said if the cuban representative had been in her place he could not have done much better communist cuban propaganda was now being parroted by ambassador power if the castro dictatorship wanted to save money it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to washington dc the cuban ambassador boasted that cuban communists had rid ourselves of us imperialism and proclaimed that we will never go back to capitalism he declared that the resolution was a powerful message to the peoples of the world the message is indeed unmistakable ben rhodes the close obama adviser who sold the media on the iran sellout curtly tweeted his justification no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose who is this we the cuban embargo is the law of the land its the official policy of the united states its based on laws passed by congress and implemented by president john f kennedy and his successors this we certainly isnt the united states government its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one one member of the we must be ben rhodes because he tells us so who is rhodes an aspiring novelist who pushed obama to back the muslim brotherhood takeover of egypt the iran nuke sellout and now apparently choosing communist cuba over america no one has ever elected rhodes to anything but under leftwing rule he outweighs congress president kennedy the law of the land and the national interests of the united states we is obama who made the final decision its ambassador samantha power its a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government this is the we that announced its treasonous opposition to the us at the un america has a we problem if the we of the american left wants to vote its own way it should secede to form its own country when president john f kennedy proclaimed the embargo on all trade with cuba he based it on authorization from the congress of the united states that is how our system used to work these days el teleprompte in dc decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with iran mandate transgender bathrooms legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in havana and he does so on his own authority and congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists thats not how america is supposed to work thats how iran works thats how cuba works the first word in the introduction to obamas presidential policy directive on cuba after the date was i obamas basis for his authority is his announcement letat cest moi obama is the state jfk no humble shrinking violet mentions i only in the fourth paragraph after congress what is the context of kennedys i now therefore i john f kennedy president of the united states of america acting under the authority of section a of the foreign assistance act of the i of jfk can only act as a servant not a master in obamas directive congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism there is no source of authorization for anything other than barack obama there is no law only obama now the big we in washington have decided that they will oppose america at the united nations but ben rhodes who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives made an unfortunate slip obama has been accused of louis xivs letat cest moi mentality but ben rhodes isnt saying we are the state instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in america one is us the other is we we does not yet entirely control the state but we also feels no obligation to the united states if we agrees with america then we will vote with it at the un if we opposes america then we votes against it we will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests not ours we happens to run america but it isnt america its the parasite humped on americas back you can call we by many names deep state is one its a coalition of leftwing special interests networking through politics the nonprofit sector and media corporations to control america president kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influenceon infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice kennedy was speaking after the recent bay of pigs crisis the foreign assistance act mentioned by him was passed by congress that year while the cuban embargo limited the ability of the castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world it didnt stop the we in washington dc it is easy to sit here in the distant future of and wonder whether cuba matters at all but the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the cold war that struggle did not end when the berlin wall fell it is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by we the people or by the nameless we of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the nomenklatura of the left by backing away from america at the united nations the we have announced their independence from the laws responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked but the we offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule instead they impose on us the collectivism of yevgeny zamyatins novel we in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the one state that controls every aspect of human life that novel inspired what we offer us is what cubas castro wes one state and every communist regime offer us its what george orwell in summed up as a boot stamping on a human face forever president kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the one hundred and eightysixth year of the independence of the united states of america at the united nations ambassador power cheerfully declared americas enforced submission to the communist demands for cuba the cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their communist overlords the question is will the united states of america be able to regain its independence from the we,1

little girl he can proudly puff his chest out after that one nishi the disturbing thing is that they actually do that they feel good about doing this kind of thing they are convinced that what they are doing is morally just and necessary reminds me of hobbesto this war of every man against every man this also is consequent that nothing can be unjust the notions of right and wrong justice and injustice have there no place where there is no common power there is no law where no law no injustice force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues jonathan sabo this is not about black it is about getting involved in a legal arrest razedbywolvs no its about black because if it wasnt white people might get pissed enough to do something about it that would not work out to well for the officers involved in legal arrests james michael she had every right to require he state why he was being arrested and the officer had no lawful arrest she also had every right to free the man from being kidnapped by a traitor you retard now why was he being arrested bruismenot what a lovely mouth that mother has no wonder the kid has no respect for the law also it looks like the kid was resisting including standingsteppingstomping on the cops left foot oh well gininitaly i looked at that video times and never saw her stomp on his precious foot she was and hardly lbs soaking wet youre telling me that a big adult male couldnt contain her threat without shoving her to the ground bruismenot unfortunately cops arent psychic and they have to react quickly to protect themselves the girl was obviously highly emotional when she approached the situation one of the most dangerous times to interfere with police activity is during the arrest of a family member its easy to sit back and criticize the cop but he doesnt know her intent nor if in the dim light shes carrying a weapon of some sort you cant just go stomping up on an arrest situation ignoring orders to stay back have you ever fought an emotionally charged year old girl they fight like wild cats just watch a video on you tube some time if you havent age doesnt always matter and year olds are adult sized cops dont put on the uniform to get hurt teach your children to respect the law show respect yourself and you wont have to worry about adult sized teenagers being thrown down by big mean cops also maybe your device is better than mine but it looks to me like the girls foot lands on his left foot i could be wrong in that ill look at it again gininitaly hogwash spoken like a cop of today who needs an excuse to brutalize for profit or the pleasure of being a bully against the defenseless lumberjacks farmers emts firemen and fishermen have more dangerous jobs than cops and i happen to be old enough to see my towns years of service police chief retire without ever having fired a shot at a human being and that was yrs of drunks with guns broken bottles or knives belligerent mouthy kids family disputes and all the rest so whats the difference between then and now his talent and yours attitude and the desire to deescalate situations not intensify them to the point of murder since and the patriot act they seem to have been given permission to make us citizens their victims instead of their friends family and neighbors that they were once supposed to protect and serve you will get no get out of jail free or pity cards from me cops today or rather whats left after the good cops get fed up and quit or were drummed off the force because those that remain are drunk on their own power over people and revel in the violence that they create httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxfaif_a_e bruismenot i didnt say the cop did a great job i didnt say that i would have reacted the same way i didnt say that i thought the video looked fine i was simply trying to give an explanation for what we saw on the video gininitaly and just who gave you that job or why you thought that cop needed defending you invented an aggression by that yr old complained about language defended the cop no matter what the video actually showed and projected your prejudices onto the entire situation in my book that makes you a worthless witness who deals in fantasy not fact no different than a lot of chicken chit americans who think defending the police or government will get you a free ticket off of the auschwitz express you should never defend the indefensible all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men to do nothing bruismenot i take it we cant be friends then stir up the sjws all day long if you must who does anyone call if they get jacked shot stabbed or whatever next time you are the victim of a real crime go ahead and call those same sjws to save your bacon see how many show up and how far you get lady dont assume you know me you dont know my story if you didwe might could be friends gininitaly i have no idea what a sjw is is that police jargon i know one thing i wouldnt be calling an american cop theyd end up shooting my dog my kid or me if they even managed to make it to the right address in some steroid induced adrenaline rush i dont need those kinds of jacked up people in my life youtheyve lost all credibility as anything that could or would help id ask a bystander for assistance before calling a cop any day your words are quite indicative of where your loyalties lie and if you think im assuming then you should come clean and tell your story and at that point i might reevaluate my take on who you are and why you seem to need to defend the indefensible in what used to be the formerly free usa httpkilledbypolicenet free_willey your explanation is bogus and it clearly indicates that you are the problem the cop should have been arrested on the spot for assault this is what makes all cops criminals they fail to arrest and charge crimes against their buddies in blue you included it astounds me that you guys continue to make your job on a daily basis more and more dangerous putrid ignorance and arrogance and a complete non caring attitude for people in general is what is on display at todays pds this is not the service that we hired you for cops work an entire lifetime to avoid disdain for the people they have sworn to serve only to have pds hire the lowest of iq and then train them to see the public as the enemy once you start to justify the violent actions of todays cops you need to leave the force furthermore you do not have to be a psychic as you claim to see that the cop simply became upset lost control and used violence to assault this less

cowards and pussysstep on my feet and im gonna arrest yallcowardscops only feel like real men when they are beating up womenall cops are just plain criminals gina you all make me sick the problem today is that we raise children to disrespect authority and then feel we can call moral high ground against those that are in place to help our youth need to be taught that they are not able to do whatever they want they need to understand that laws apply to them and if not followed prepare for consequences the point of no return that i see in this video is a year old female that feels she has the right to interfere in an arrest in progress and before anyone touts unlawful bull it is clearly stated that a warrant was in place for the arrest and as such she was wrong for interfering mom is equally to blame filming it hoping to make a quick buck or news scandal instead of correcting her daughter for her behaviour ibcamn so is what your saying is bow down to these retarded criminals and follow orders without question and raise our children to be just like you and never question authority and be a slavesucks to be you stopkingobama heres an idea dont interfere with the cops when they are trying to arrest someone you fucking creampuff libtard crybabies just dont get it fucking morons think they can adjudicate a case in the streets while the arrest is taking place try protesting

mins ago about archive bob unruh joined wnd in after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print dr eric walsh photo first liberty the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church but dr eric walsh is resisting issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons walshs ordeal began in may when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency only a week later a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventhday adventist church lee rudd the agencys human resources director then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately two days later walsh was fired at that point lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks chesin walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the constitution order today now in response to walshs lawsuit the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands among a flood of other paperwork copies of his sermon notes and transcripts this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church said jeremy dys senior counsel for first liberty no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general who did not respond to a request for comment walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile filthy blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen the mayor at the time annise parker withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest in a prepared statement wednesday on walshs case welch said i cant believe im saying this but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded different categories of materials including sermons from us welch the executive director of the texas pastor council said what is happening to walsh is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons first this is state government coming after a pastor not just a rogue mayor in one city he said also the state is demanding much more material sermons sermon notes all documents without even topical or time limits it could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching bible its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study this sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor every church every denomination and every citizen of faith in america leaders of concerned women for america legislative action committee part of the nations largest public policy womens group with members also came to walshs defense penny nance ceo said the words of reverend dr martin luther king jr that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere still reverberate today especially as we witness the gestapolike tactics of his native state the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom as they discriminate against another pastor dr eric walsh is indeed a threat to every american whatever our religious beliefs can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor examine and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed walshs sermons and then fired him no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon dys told fox news when the case was filed he was fired for something he said in a sermon if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything the original state investigation of walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist state officials also joked about informing walsh of his firing the telephone call was between dr patrick oneal an agency official and kate pfirman an agency financial officer the call was captured on an answering machine which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up pfirman said and im gonna be very im gonna try to come off as very cold because i dont want to say very much if i try to make it warm ive thought that through its gonna just not theres no warm way to say it anyway then there was laughter from both parties oneal then said to inform walsh youre out and there was another round of laughter its very funny pfirman said the voicemail in the houston dispute voters ultimately soundly rejected parkers ordinance giving gays and transgendered people special rights,1

essential reams of content have been written on the topic both on rok and elsewhere indeed its possible to get lost in a tsunami of pickup advice but while it can be useful to absorb successful peoples techniques a shortcut is to observe their habits and adopt them yourself to that end here is a list of the top five habits ive observed in men who are great with women they take every opportunity guys who are great with women recognize and take up every opportunity that is presented to them in this way they are somewhat akin to entrepreneurs they know that the market is in a constant state of flux and that change is at the heart of opportunity as such like the speculators of pussy they are they are never afraid to launch a takeover bid regardless of the circumstances game writers will often advise men that they should be approaching all the time i would wholeheartedly endorse this i would also add that however many opportunities youre taking now there are always more to be had i for example will try to get my first approach of the day in in the morning while im traveling to my office on the subway there are so many cute girls on their way to work in london or any reasonablysized commuter city and yet guys wont talk to them rationalizing that it is too early shell think im crazy or whatever in actual fact ive probably taken more phone numbers and set up more dates through morning approaches than at any other time so next time you are out and about and see an attractive girl be sure to approach her whatever the time or the circumstances it is only by being present and open to all prospects that you will truly optimize your game they notice and follow up on iois while most game advice is centered on what the guy should do in order to attract the girl the fact remains that there will be many times that girls will shoot you socalled indicators of interest or iois without you having done anything while i would never advise anyone to rely on these as a mainstay i would counsel that you should always at least do your best to notice them and to follow up with alacrity not only do direct iois frequently lead to sex but also if you fail to pursue a potentiallyinterested girl you may find yourself regretting it for a long time afterwards men after all are the more romantic gender there are few more lasting selfinflicted wounds than the thought of that beautiful girl who smiled at you at the museum and who you just know you could have dated had you had the courage to speak to her the successful seducer is always on the lookout for iois therefore and hell execute quickly when he gets them even if it means deviating slightly from his routine for example a while back i was on a subway train when i got strong direct eye contact from an attractive petite and very feminine brunettejust my type once youve been in the game a while you will learn to distinguish a solid ioi from casual interest but the best way to describe it is as that rabbit in the headlights look that girls give when they are truly smitten well she was giving me that look and i knew i had to follow up when she got of the train i went right after her introduced myself on the platform took her number and then left a drink and then several awesome sex sessions ensued later had i not taken the time to go after her then we would never have connected remember always be willing to go after a sure thing and never leave money on the table they stand out from the crowd every truly successful seducer i have ever known has found ways to differentiate himself and stand out from the crowd this can manifest itself in many ways but primarily im talking about standing out physically in terms of what you wear and standing out in terms of your personality while the old concept of peacocking is rightly maligned by both men and women these days there can nevertheless be little argument with the fact that all else being equal the better dressed man will be more successful than his slacksandsweatshirt counterpart a former colleague of mine who has slept with more women than anyone else ive ever met was particular about his clothes to the point of obsession i appreciate that this will immediately cause some people to question his masculinity what real man takes so much care over his clothes but remember that narcissism is one of the three dark triad characteristics that are like catnip to women along with machiavellianism and psychopathy therefore taking time to select a silk pocket square that contrasts dramatically with your blazer plus the right trousers and shoes will help your cause a lotif you remember that your main aim is to stand out rather than blend in your personality too should be larger than life dont be obnoxious but as a rule of thumb try to ensure that you are louder and have more to say than the other men in the group they are dominant there can be no doubt that women are attracted to masculine men and that means that to be a contender you need to be dominant now of course the massive and blatantly obvious caveat here is that you should also be ultimately respectful and appreciate that no means no nevertheless within these boundaries it will serve you well to ensure that your body language your tone of voice and your general demeanor communicates dominance both of the woman you are interacting with as well as any men in your vicinity the key thing here is to appear decisive and unwaveringeven if secretly you arent for example after youve had a couple of drinks with a girl on a date try getting up taking her by the hand and simply leading her to a taxi when she questions what youre doing just say were going back to my place to watch a movie doing this will communicate that you have had similar success with women before and that you are not intimidated by her now in the back of your mind you may well be uncertain that she will acquiesce and thats fine just do the actions anyway and see what happens shes much more likely to want to go home with you if you demonstrate leadership and even if she doesnt she will still respect you more which will pay dividends the next time you meet they dont apologize highly successful seducers never apologizeor certainly not for minor social infractions anyway the fact of the matter is you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs if you are the kind of guy who frequently approaches women while demonstrating leadership and a certain kind of cockyfunny humor then the chances are youre going to offend someone every so often now im not recommending that you should be a dickbe classy and convivial in all your interactions but the truth of the matter is that the real seducer always ruffles a few feathers in his quest for vaginal valhalla if someone gets offended then make a joke but dont apologize as long as have acted lawfully then you have nothing to be sorry for remember an apology is a submission to someone elses frameand that is never a good look want to find out how to approach and seduce sexy girls buy my bestselling book the seven laws of seduction for daily game advice connect with me on twitter troylaws read more why you

of charter schools could be approved by the state district in the next fiscal year the charter school scam has spread its tentacles into the state ofmassachusetts in large part due to the obama administration a vote no is thus critical toward halting the march of privatization in the education system occurring nationwide as massachusetts residents gear up to vote for the next president of the united states it is important to remember that the transformation of public education into a private good will not cease as long as popular opposition fails to confront its roots in washington the obama administration immediately created the race to the top program after the election this program paved a direct path toward the elimination of public education as we know it the department of education funneled billions of us dollars into incentive schemes to privatize public schools district by district federal funds were dangled in front of mostly poor mostly black cities as long as these districts met the mandates of the program these mandates included the closure of failing schools mergers with forprofit charter schools and the complete transformation of public schools into charter laboratories race to the top created favorable conditions for private capitalists to engulf the entire us public education system the results have been disastrous hundreds of public schools have closed around the country tens of thousands of public school teachers have been fired in new orleans nearly every school operating in the district is a privately owned by publicly funded charter schools the chicago teachers union recently averted a strike but has been dealing with the consequences of the closure of fifty schools in the city in the impact of charter schools has extended beyond teacher layoffs and school closures charter schools have also promoted segregation based on race and class the civil rights project of ucla has found that seventy percent of black charter school students attend intensely segregated charter schools furthermore charter schools also demand an even more intense policy of standardized testing withcurriculums that are often guided by the test corporations themselves all the while these institutions have found ample time to discriminate against els and disabled students in addition charter schools have been found to cheat students from a quality education charter schools are even more militarized than traditional public schools and sport higher rates of suspension and expulsion rates corporate charter operators also cream students from the top and toss the rest even so charters have not proven to do any better than public schools in terms of test scores what the charter school movement does possess is the backing of the elite which has masterfully used media and nonprofit manipulation to demonize public education the usual capitalist players have been the primary leaders in the drive to rid of the charter school cap in massachusetts the new york lobbying group families for excellent schools is controlled by hedge fund managers whose funds stem from donations from the walton family ie walmart another organization education reform now advocacy has received upwards of million dollars from the same source charter schools are often labeled public because they receive tax payer dollars however the schools are accountable to no one except the corporate interests that back them a yes vote on question two would place the education of students in massachusetts firmly in the hands of the kingpins of privatization not only would twelve charter schools per year be subject to approval but fortyfive public schools would be in danger of closure over million more dollars per year would be siphoned from public schools across the state at the moment the charter school cap allows the state to operate no more than charter schools if the cap islifted however this restriction would no longer apply and leave the students families and educatorsvictimto the shock and awe privatization which has characterized national policy for over two decades opposition to privatization is being led by the organization save our schools save our schools consists of families teachers students and unions that are looking to prevent an era of unbridled privatization in the massachusetts public education system charter schools already drain million from public education in the stateeach year as it currently stands a vote no would protect public schools and thus the unions that representtheir educators a no vote would build upon numerous labor victories in the massachusetts area over the last few years the boston school bus drivers union local won a historic victory against the veolia corporation in the harvard dining workers of local unite here followed by defeating harvards bid to raise healthcare costs in october of now it is time to stand with teachers across the state in their effort to prevent fullscale privatization doing so will not be easy the model of unionmanagement cooperationwith thedemocratic party continues to prevent workers in massachusetts and across the country from taking offensive action against the privatization assault a vote no on question in massachusetts would show that community and union members can organize a successful pushback against the forces behind privatization however a vision of transformation and radical change must be articulated if defense of public education is to materialize into a peoples movement the fight against privatization must be placed in the contextof the larger struggle to build a world that working and oppressed people would vote yes to,0

largely due to trumps obnoxious candor and grandiose proclamations she is working her way back into the favor of disgruntled democrats and even right wing firebrands like the notorious glenn beck she is without question a wolf in sheeps clothing while trump is unbelievably hard to take constantly we need to focus on one simple question which of these candidates will lead to world devastation first i suspect it would be hillary clinton who would be most inclined toward involving americans in another military conflict and she doesnt go small as she constantly demonizes russia with threats of military action in clintons own words youve seen reports russia has hacked into a lot of things china has hacked into a lot of things russia even hacked into the democratic national committee maybe even some state election systems so weve got to step up our game make sure we are well defended and can take the fight to those who go after us as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses military responses to a nation the us stood on the verge of war with for more than four decades military response against russia over suspected hacking hillary clinton betrayed her real mindset once and for all during the recent debate with donald trump when she spoke those words of war that would surely lead to only disastrous consequences it all stems from the wikileaks release that included emails and attachments from leaders at the democratic national committee clinton says the russians did it the national mainstream media parroted those words its the american medias political conditioning system at its finest convincingly reaching tens of millions of americans and yet nobody knows if the blame is properly attributed to the russians in a usa today article from july elizabith weise wrote computer security researchers say its difficult to definitively say the cyber theft of files from the democratic national committee subsequently posted online by wikileaks was the work of russian hackers as some media outlets have reported russias leader vladmir putin says the us long ago tipped the scales in the wrong direction well before the cold war even ended peace with russia should be a top priority for any us presidential candidate the truth is that american politicians perpetually convinced they are making the right political moves created a road block on the highway to peace during the vietnam war putin said during the st petersburg international economic forum it is not in my nature to scold someone but when the united states unilaterally withdrew from the abm treaty in they delivered a colossal blow to the entire system of international security that was the first blow when it comes to assessing the strategic balance of power in the world more things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital voting for the lesser evil now we have clinton warmongering over unfounded allegations world rivals in the air there is a decadesold history of rivalry between eastern and western jet fighter design and technology while american designs are more expensive and generally considered to be better the fastest jet fighter ever made is the russian mig it can break mach iii more than three times the speed of sound such demands lessen the life of an aircraft the mig is typically not flown at anything close to that speed as an interceptor however it was supreme no allied fighter in the sky could outrun it the korean war was the first test soviet migs initially dominated the skies with russian and chinese pilots often at the controls the migs were deadly on november at least sixteen american f fighters p mustangs were shot at by six soviet mig interceptors led by soviet wwii ace mayor nikolay v stroykov the wwii prop planes like the mustang along with the us f shooting star and f thunderjet jet fighters had a job on their hands fighting the robust and highly maneuverable mig fighters everything changed when the us air force launched the f sabre wikipedia explains that the f sabre pilots enjoyed advantages they learned to exploit to the fullest foremost among those was a radar ranging gun sight on their six caliber machine guns which ensured that even short bursts of fire generally found their target f pilots were also equipped with gsuits which prevented pilot blackout in highspeed turning maneuvers it is unlikely that anybody will ever fully agree on the casualties and kill ratios over mig alley during the korean war the soviets claimed united nations planes of all types shot down including about sabres the usaf only admits to losing less than aircraft in air combat the f pilots claimed migs shot down while b gunners claimed a further these numbers were later reduced to migs the chinese air force claimed only kills in vietnam the competitors varied the mig and mig fighters were widely used by the north vietnamese air force they fought planes like the f super sabre f tiger and the f phantom once again if you believe western sources which are fairly reliable for the most part the us planes dominated in most air to air combat though the other side had plenty of talented pilots and more aces overall than the americans during the end of the cold war in the s the soviet mig was the terror of the skies there was more speculation about it than real knowledge at first while mig aircraft were only built in odd numbers the movie top gun references the aircraft by calling them migs migs no ones been this close before the planes used in the movie were actually american f tigers painted black with red stars applied to the tails today the united states spends obscene amounts on planes like the f raptor and these aircraft do not have any clear advantages over modern russian planes like the su both in this case are capable of thrust vectoring which means the pilot can change the direction of the jet blast and create an entirely separate way to control the jet in flight the ultimate western jet in the world of thrust vectoring is the avb harrier which can actually take off and land like a helicopter hopefully the world will not have to put these machines against each other in a future war but with clinton at the helm it is entirely possible and the advantages the us used to hold over the russian military have evaporated into thin air russias modern approach to warfare during the decadeslong cold war the soviet union operated under archaic rules that essentially prevented a commander or a pilot from knowing their mission until they were dispatched to carry out the order kemp freund a us army sergeant major that i met while i was covering the war in afghanistan was quote d in my video report camp joyce remote fire base near afghanistanpakistan border saying were trying to break the old soviet methods that they use and the soviet method had that lt col completely in the dark until he needed to move he added were still working with the higher echelons to get that to move downhill the soviet ways were detrimental and offered little freedom to a trained soldier or pilot but all that is over now todays russian pilots not only fly superior aircraft that cost far less than us taxpayer funded military planes they also utilize tactics of western pilots hillary clinton surely knows these facts but she wants to play with fire and be another war president which was so important to former president george w bush and obama too for that matter other looming conflicts lest we forget hillary clintons unwavering support of israel the apartheid religious nuclear state that has long been protected by us taxpayer money and military hardware the government of right wing israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu continues to violate the human rights of palestinians constantly while building settlements which are completely illegal under international law then there are the attacks in gaza that target schools and hospitals leaving hundreds and hundreds dead and thousands severely injured never does clinton speak out against the barbaric treatment israel reserves for nonjews never does she refer to the fact that the country we now call iran hasnt attacked a nation outside of its borders for more than three hundred years yet iran has been savagely attacked by the united states both directly and indirectly maintaining her warmongering spirit clinton said i want the iranians to know that if im president we will attack iran she added that we would be able to totally obliterate them,0

netanyahus upcoming trips to australia singapore kazakhstan and azerbaijan might be the most significant diplomatic visits he makes in his tenure in office the trips will take place against the backdrop of two major international shifts that cast israel into uncharted waters as a small state with a dizzying array of strategic threats arrayed against it the states that he will visit are all wellpositioned to help israel navigate its next moves the first shift is the uss political crackup next week american voters will choose their next president the major candidates democratic nominee hillary clinton and republican nominee donald trump are the weakest candidates to have ever stood for the highest office in the land their rise is a testament to the weakening if not the unraveling of the glue that has held america together since the civil war the unraveling of the us electorate comes against the backdrop of the diminution of us military power the uss multitrillion dollar investment in inconclusive if not failed wars in the middle east over the past years has come at the expense of military modernization the f program has sucked up the majority of the remaining research and development funds and it has yet to produce a reliable airplane worse the fs long and problematic gestation period has given russia and china the time and opportunity to develop air defense systems capable of neutralizing the fs stealth systems those systems were supposed to be its chief advantage as the next generation fighter for the us and its allies the deterioration of the uss military capabilities has gone hand in hand with the uss apparent loss of strategic rationality this is apparent worldwide but is nowhere more obvious than in the middle east president barack obamas decision to effectively abandon the uss major allies in the middle east in favor of cultivating ties with iran has made the region far more dangerous to the us and its spurned allies than it was eight years ago true in theory obamas decision to prefer the shiites to the sunnis makes sense given the totalitarian and imperial nature of sunni jihadism but in light of the genocidal totalitarian and imperial nature of the current iranian regime his move made no sense and its impact has been massively destructive moreover obamas willingness to rack up the uss national debt in an unprecedented manner and repress economic growth through overregulation has left a large question mark over the possibility of a military buildup in other words even under the best circumstances it is hard to imagine that the us will be capable of reestablishing its global primacy over the next four years or even over the next decade the implications for israel are far reaching for decades israels strategic posture has been predicated on its ability to depend on us power this strategic posture is no longer tenable the second major international shift is russias sudden rise as the primary global power in the middle east as channel reported sunday night russia has deployed sophisticated naval and air systems in the region that can detect all of israels air and naval operations in a matter of months israel has lost the air and naval supremacy it has enjoyed for the past four decades the air force reportedly is convinced that the fs stealth systems will be able to neutralize russias detection capabilities but given the welldocumented current problems with the fs stealth systems this conviction is unwise and even under the best circumstances in which israel has the opportunity to develop its own electronic warfare systems and apply them to its f without american interference it will take israel years to surmount the challenge that rapidly improving russian systems present to our air force according to channel s report air force and naval commanders are in a panic over the sudden turn of events rather than panicking though israel needs to roll with the punches and figure out how best to cope with this new situation the obvious answer is that we need to quickly expand our capabilities in areas that russias military primacy does not reach specifically israel needs to expand massively its capacity for undertheradar operations the first area that needs to be massively strengthened is our intelligence capabilities particularly human intelligence capabilities israel should be investing massively in developing and expanding our cultivation and direction of proxies on the ground throughout the region second israel needs to adapt its cyber technology capabilities in a manner that diminishes our enemies ability to strike us israel needs to be able to disrupt and disable command and control and other systems israels reach needs to extend as low down the line of its enemies military chain of command as possible if our offensive capabilities are being checked so must the capabilities of our enemies indeed our enemies need to be subverted part of the intelligence and cyber capabilities that israel must develop and deploy must be geared toward destabilizing with the goal of overthrowing the regime in iran at the same time israel should be empowering antiregime sectors in iran in a manner that expands the prospect of developing close ties with a successor regime along the lines of the strategic alliance israel built with the regime of the shah in the decades which preceded the islamic revolution third israel needs to expand and diversify the capabilities of our ground forces israel needs to be capable of using new means to deploy its fighters at home and on distant shores it needs to align its both its special and regular forces with the new threat environment and it needs to be able to utilize its ground forces in manners that can extend the reach and diminish the compromised positions of its air and naval assets in the era of russian regional primacy fourth israel needs to expand its economic growth and diversify its economic ties in a manner that positions it as a regional economic power it needs to use it natural gas resources specifically as a means to expand and deepen its ties with asia such economic growth and power will positively influence russias willingness to allow israel to carry out air and naval operations against its enemies and russias allies in lebanon syria and beyond in other words the more economically powerful israel is the more russia will be willing to side with israel against hezbollah and others that are currently operating under the russian umbrella this then brings us to netanyahus upcoming trips each state that he will visit has something to offer israel in expanding its intelligence cyberwarfare and economic capabilities australia a major western economy is moving toward china as america has become less engaged in the pacific israel has an acute interest in using australia as a platform for expanding its ties to china and other asian countries both because of the economic advantages such ties convey and due to chinas strategic importance to russia as for singapore israel effectively built the singaporean military in the s and s the country remains extremely supportive of israel like

of europe daryush roosh valizadeh created rok in october you can visit his blog at rooshvcom or follow him on twitter and facebook rss november books written in the camp of the saints is a novel by jean raspail that predicted the european migrant crisis forty years before it began not only the actual invasion by brown migrants but also the leftist arguments that enabled it which ushered europe to its doom the story follows a onemillion strong flotilla of indians who are slowly making their way to europe the leaders and people of europe have decided not to stop their arrival light on action the book focuses on the mood of the pending arrival particularly how europeans were eager to cuck themselves into oblivion after all your helpall the seeds and drugs and technologymigrants found it so much simpler just to say heres my son heres my daughter take them take me take us all to your country and the idea caught on you thought it was fine you encouraged it organized it but now its too big now its out of your hands its a flood a deluge and its out of control youve gone and worked up a race problem out of whole cloth right in the heart of the white world just to destroy it thats what youre after you want to destroy our world our whole way of life raspail understood how the media whips the public into feeling immense guilt as a mechanism to introduce nonwhite migrants well before the globalist view on migration and equality was elucidated raspail was steps ahead in predicting what the result of it would be as if he was reading into a crystal ball he even knew that migrants would bring diseases like tuberculosis and all at once whole sections of new york are deserted a score of american cities watch the flight to the suburbsand half the historic paris pavement tooamerican tots in their integrated schools fall five years behind tubercular gauls flee in droves from our openair clinics tallyho tallyho just listen to that battering ram smash at the southern gate the centurieslong segregation of the first and thirdworld brought great complacency upon europe no one could really get a grasp of what was in store once the thirdworld reached critical mass and started invading the west i can tell vilsberg continued that you really dont believe how serious the situation is after all we lived side by side with the third world convinced that our hermetic coexistence our global segregation would last forever what a deadly illusion now we see that the third world is a great unbridled mass obeying only those impulsive urges that well up when millions of hapless wills come together in the grip of despair in a bittersweet scene one of the prominent media leftists goes out with his wife to celebrate the arrival of the flotilla with joyous africans towards the end of the party his wife gets brutally raped by them and he eventually dies in sorrow the hordes arrival suddenly awakened all the immigrants already in the country into asserting themselves they began stealing directly from the native citizens by attacking their white privilege now its a known fact that racism comes in two forms that practiced by whitesheinous and inexcusable whatever its motivesand that practiced by blacksquite justified whatever its excesses since its merely the expression of a righteous revenge and its up to the whites to be patient and understanding what drives the maniacal leftist raspail believes its a suicide mechanism likely activated by a human organism void of spirit and with no reason to endure a cosmopolitan existence attempting to destroy its host culture is an indirect way of killing itself whenever the pop tunes would lose their blaring charm there was nothing left but to let oneself drown in the stickysweet syrup of human misery and despair set to music of sorts that one refuge of yearning and unfulfilled souls that had learned nothing else it never occurred to any of them to measure that notion of misery against the past or against their own wellbeing for them it was a drug and they needed to shoot up a good strong dose to keep themselves going like addicts and their heroin the fact that it was often hard to come by close to home made very little difference nothing stops an addict when he has to have his fix and poisons like that are easy to import theres never a lack of pushers besides modern man has always had tucked away in the back of his mind that singular longing for total destruction sole cure for the boredom and anguish that consume him the book even predicted a cucked catholic church raspail knew that every institution had to be on board with europes destruction for the thirdworld invasion to proceed seamlessly i came south like a lot of other priests father to hail what i thought would be mankinds redemption to welcome the million christs on board those ships who would rise up reborn and signal the dawn of a just new day the european women who welcomed the refugees became whores for them if you think this is too extreme consider that european women are getting raped by migrants today but not reporting the crime yet if a white man so much as brushes past them hes accused of assault she died in nice in a whorehouse for hindus disgusted with everything in general and herself in particular at the time each refugee quarter had its stock of white women all free for the taking and perfectly legal yes the third world had started to overflow its banks and the west was its sewer raspail even predicted the fact that the media would elevant the interracial couplings of white women and the invaders we saw something similar recently when the german government sponsored sex workshops for migrants on how to fornicate with german girls ralph ginzburg the famous american publisher had printed a series of photos in his magazine eros which had caused not a little ink to be spilled they showed an interracial couplewhite woman black manin various stages of nude embrace with a caption that read as follows tomorrow these couples will be recognized as the pioneers of an enlightened age in which prejudice will be dead and the only race will be the human race the fleet made landfall in france the french impotent to do the right thing to save their country tripped head first into spreading the welcome mat they actually competed with each other to see who would be the most welcoming you can imagine the result when one million wretches made landfall in a country they cared nothing about the new social justice government that rose forth catered to the invaders more than the french similar to what we already see in western european nations in war the real enemy is always behind the lines never in front of you never among you always at your back thats something every soldier knows in every army since the world began and plenty of times theyve been tempted to turn their backs on the enemythe socalled enemy that isand give it to the real one once and for all when freedom expands to mean freedom of instinct and social destruction then freedom is dead the book itself wasnt my style of storytelling raspail made numerous detours and longwinded soliloquies that took away from the action in favor of creating accurate character portrayals its more of a mood novel than one that moved forward at an exciting pace the only flaw is that it didnt predict the rise of an alternative media that would sound the alarm bell even though an active invasion is taking place today the antimigrant side is far stronger than whats portrayed in the book the camp of the saints was a prophetic story that showed how the migrants themselves werent the only cause of europes destructionleftists played the largest role in ripping apart the country before their arrival a fact that many of us already know too well nov roosh valizadeh,1
