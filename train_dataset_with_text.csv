an important question is on the  election statewide ballot in massachusetts question  deals with the states charter school cap without the cap upwards of  charter schools could be approved by the state district in the next fiscal year the charter school scam has spread its tentacles into the state ofmassachusetts in large part due to the obama administration a vote no is thus critical toward halting the march of privatization in the education system occurring nationwide as massachusetts residents gear up to vote for the next president of the united states it is important to remember that the transformation of public education into a private good will not cease as long as popular opposition fails to confront its roots in washington
the obama administration immediately created the race to the top program after the  election this program paved a direct path toward the elimination of public education as we know it the department of education funneled billions of us dollars into incentive schemes to privatize public schools district by district federal funds were dangled in front of mostly poor mostly black cities as long as these districts met the mandates of the program these mandates included the closure of failing schools mergers with forprofit charter schools and the complete transformation of public schools into charter laboratories race to the top created favorable conditions for private capitalists to engulf the entire us public education system
the results have been disastrous hundreds of public schools have closed around the country tens of thousands of public school teachers have been fired in new orleans nearly every school operating in the district is a privately owned by  publicly funded charter schools the chicago teachers union recently averted a strike but has been dealing with the consequences of the closure of fifty schools in the city in  
the impact of charter schools has extended beyond teacher layoffs and school closures charter schools have also promoted segregation based on race and class the civil rights project of ucla has found that seventy percent of black charter school students attend intensely segregated charter schools  furthermore charter schools also demand an even more intense policy of standardized testing withcurriculums that are often guided by the test corporations themselves all the while these institutions have found ample time to discriminate against els and disabled students
in addition charter schools have been found to cheat students from a quality education charter schools are even more militarized than traditional public schools and sport higher rates of suspension and expulsion rates corporate charter operators also cream students from the top and toss the rest even so charters have not proven to do any better than public schools in terms of test scores  what the charter school movement does possess is the backing of the elite which has masterfully used media and nonprofit manipulation to demonize public education
the usual capitalist players have been the primary leaders in the drive to rid of the charter school cap in massachusetts the new york lobbying group families for excellent schools is controlled by hedge fund managers whose funds stem from donations from the walton family ie walmart another organization education reform now advocacy has received upwards of  million dollars from the same source  charter schools are often labeled public because they receive tax payer dollars however the schools are accountable to no one except the corporate interests that back them
a yes vote on question two would place the education of students in massachusetts firmly in the hands of the kingpins of privatization not only would twelve charter schools per year be subject to approval but fortyfive public schools would be in danger of closure over  million more dollars per year would be siphoned from public schools across the state at the moment the charter school cap allows the state to operate no more than  charter schools if the cap islifted however this restriction would no longer apply and leave the students families and educatorsvictimto the shock and awe privatization which has characterized national policy for over two decades
opposition to privatization is being led by the organization save our schools save our schools consists of families teachers students and unions that are looking to prevent an era of unbridled privatization in the massachusetts public education system charter schools already drain  million from public education in the stateeach year as it currently stands a vote no would protect public schools and thus the unions that representtheir educators
a no vote would build upon numerous labor victories in the massachusetts area over the last few years the boston school bus drivers union local  won a historic victory against the veolia corporation in  the harvard dining workers of local  unite here followed by defeating harvards bid to raise healthcare costs in october of  now it is time to stand with teachers across the state in their effort to prevent fullscale privatization
doing so will not be easy the model of unionmanagement cooperationwith thedemocratic party continues to prevent workers in massachusetts and across the country from taking offensive action against the privatization assault a vote no on question  in massachusetts would show that community and union members can organize a successful pushback against the forces behind privatization however a vision of transformation and radical change must be articulated if defense of public education is to materialize into a peoples movement the fight against privatization must be placed in the contextof the larger struggle to build a world that working and oppressed people would vote yes to",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,3.528806933996037,8,2,5819,919,5.306855277475517,919.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,0.7514371058191514,0.6627437946416888,0.2148813028863721,0.6898359037078503,0.0021762785636561,0.0,0.0021762785636561,0,0,0.0,0.0038536726276695,-0.1979,0.087,0.085,0.828,Negative,Weak

military officials in tunisia have rejected claims that the country is hosting a base for us drone operations against the daesh takfiri terrorist group in neighboring libya 
tunisias defense minister farhat horchani on thursday ruled out any possibility that foreign forces could have direct access to tunisian military bases or run their own in the country 
we dont  and wont  have a foreign military base in tunisia horchani said adding we were one of the few first countries to oppose a foreign military intervention in libya 
a tunisian defense ministry spokesman also said on thursday that the north african country has never allowed washington to operate unmanned planes from its territory for antidaesh missions 
tunisian soil has never been and never will be used to strike targets in libya the drones are used by tunisians and no one else belhassen oueslati said adding as part of tunisianus bilateral cooperation we have acquired drones to train our military personnel to use this technology and to control our southeastern border with libya and detect any suspicious movement 
the remarks came after us media claimed that washington has expanded its deployment of drones to north africa as part of a secret program 
a report by the washington post said on wednesday that unmanned aircraft and us military personnel had been deployed to a facility in tunisia to conduct spy missions in neighboring libya the paper added that drones began flying out of the tunisian base in late june claiming that the dispatch of the planes was a key element of the extended us air offensive against a daesh stronghold in libya 
daesh which is known for its terror acts in iraq and syria has been operating mostly in northern libya a country which slipped into chaos in  following the ouster of longtime dictator muammar gaddafi 
forces loyal to libyas unity government which enjoy the support of the west and the united nations have been battling daesh militants over the past six months in the coastal city of sirte 
us africa command africom said on thursday that since august  pentagon has carried out  airstrikes in libya to help libyan forces in the fight in sirte 
there are us service members working with the tunisian security forces for counterterrorism and they are sharing intelligence from various sources to include unarmed aerial platforms said colonel mark r cheadle spokesman for us africa command

ladylove,bahrains rajab hospitalized due to heart condition,"nato pushes military buildup plans near russia wed oct   am eu nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg speaks during a news conference at the alliances headquarters in brussels belgium october   photo by reuters 
the north atlantic treaty organization nato is pushing for its biggest military buildup near russian borders as the western military alliance continues to harbor perceptions of a russian threat since the days of the cold war 
nato secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg will discuss the plan for military deployments to the baltic states and eastern poland at a twoday meeting of nato ministers in brussels on wednesday 
the military alliance aims to send battle groups to the baltic states and poland early next year the groups will consist of  forces it will be the biggest military buildup near russia since the second world war more forces would also be deployed if necessary 
this is credible deterrence not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict stoltenberg claimed contradictorily on tuesday referring to the planned deployments near russia concrete proof that nato can and will deploy thousands of forces to support our allies and a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond 
the united states germany britain and canada have already agreed to contribute forces to the battle groups which are to be deployed to poland lithuania estonia and latvia norwegian and italian fighter jets patrol over the baltics during a nato air policing mission from an airbase in lithuania may   photo by reuters 
france denmark italy and other nato members are expected to contribute forces of their own but have been reluctant so far 
antirussia by default 
russia had previously warned that it would take unspecified measures to respond to the increased activities by the western military bloc 
it also moved nuclearcapable missiles to its westernmost region of kaliningrad near its border with the baltic countries and nato member states earlier this month the iskanderm cruise missiles are capable of hitting targets across poland and the baltics 
nato was formed during the cold war as a means of countering the former soviet union 
the military alliance suspended all ties with moscow in april  after the thenukrainian crimea peninsula voted in a referendum to join russian territory 
shortly afterwards an armed conflict broke out in eastern ukraine areas inhabited by an ethnicallyrussian population the ukrainian government which militarized the originally peaceful unrest in the regions  known as the donbass  has ever since been accusing russia of having a hand in the conflict there moscow denies the claim 
the conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than  people and left over  others injured loading",presstv.com,Real,english,93.39528379412258,84.45285857853474,50,7,2727,432,5.256944444444445,432.0,-0.3656534312002963,-0.5778293249656962,-0.0666184963314689,-0.1007167501193813,0.1656242054726353,-0.0914740491049698,0.0023148148148148,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0057337190087942,0.4556,0.1,0.088,0.812,Positive,Moderate

by  its predicted the usa will no longer have a white majority which in  was  for this we can thank ted kennedys immigration and nationality act of  which the politicians swore up and down wouldnt change the american ethnic composition in europe due to declining native birth rates and mass immigration  this will eventually come to pass for several other nations later this century all according to the coudenhovekalergi plan  the leftists with their really big hearts  think all this will be wonderful 
globalism and cultural marxism are the driving forces behind population replacement policies but unawareness and apathy are almost as much of a problem  some think that if western civilization will go down the toilet they should just go with the flow and enjoy the ride all the way down the tubes thanks to media propaganda and educational indoctrination they have no idea that their own civilization is worth anything and dont have the slightest concern for their own posterity still theyre pretty naive to believe that things cant turn far worse within their own lifetimes why this is bad for those who need reminding in the future is this going to get better or worse 
if trends continue unabated the founding peoples will lose control over their destiny history shows that when this happens the results are not good pillaging and plundering is a more genteel affair in modern times though not always  but youre still not going to like it will your new rulers say since things have changed so much how about we abolish affirmative action and setasides to show weve transcended race dont count on it more likely theyll double down on these preferential treatment programs and come up with new ones and you will have no chance to block the spoils systems 
thats just the beginning too the  diversification  of cities for the last several decades has been baddetroit need i say moreand riots really are getting out of hand now imagine what it will be like when you have no hope of influencing things like section  housing moving into your neighborhood or if youll get any real police protection 
this is what were facing if the aztlán crowd takes over the southwest the community agitators get in charge of the big cities and together their constituency has an electoral majority controlling the federal government also remember that theyve been told since the s that youre evil oppressors responsible for all their problems parts of flyover country might be able to hold out for a while but nothing short of forming their own country will stop the advance of progress if it were ever to come to secession theyll be surrounded outnumbered and outgunned lets keep things from getting to that point is there any hope refugees have taken on the characteristics of invaders 
ive painted a grim picture but i have to be realistic as for what will happen later things only look worse jean raspails camp of the saints describes a bleak future like that this isnt just the usa on the line but western europe too and perhaps eastern europe and australia in time if we want to keep from disappearing into the endless night the time to act is now 
sometimes with luck sovereignty can be regained for example the spanish reconquista or the nations of the balkans rising after a few centuries under the turkish yoke however the results arent guaranteed some nations may never recover in these examples the dhimmis were subjugated under military occupation but they were not outnumbered in their own lands the founding populations must not allow themselves to be dispossessed in their own countries in the first place 
granted the dark forces of globalism are very powerfuland theyd like us to think theyre invinciblebut they must be stopped they also want you to think theyre smarter than you and know whats good for you  if theyd simply focus on getting richer and cease their social engineering theyd have far less to answer for not only has our political establishment failed us theyre working against the public  it wont be easy but we must reassert control over our destiny do we deserve to be dispossessed brainwashed sjws welcoming their own destruction 
some will even sayoften with haughty condescensionthat if we lose our countries then we deserve this fate ignoring for a moment the sheer snottiness as well as the might makes right argument incongruent with the usual rhetoric of fairness by the prepare to be assimilated resistance is futile crowd lets consider the following facts in the s a communist propaganda campaign was launched in the western world in the s this mutated into cultural marxism and kicked into high gear during the s most people have no idea of the scope of it all or where things like political correctness came from only senior citizens remember what it was like living in a fairly normal country even fewer never grew up exposed to this propaganda in one form or another the rest of us have been indoctrinated from an early age by the mass media and educational establishment the western political tradition lately is about openness and democracy for this reason we dont conduct political change by torches and pitchforks these days we play fair even if our enemies often dont  further political correctness encourages the disadvantaged to have solidarity but vilifies the same in the majority this is one reason why were on the defensive and for now usually losing most people only have a vague idea about the extent of managed democracy and sheer corruption those against population replacement policies mostly put their faith in the mainstream opposition parties not realizing that theyve sold out to deeppockets globalists too mainstream conservatism is a controlled opposition  providing token resistance at best 
so with that extent of treachery disinformation limited options for resistance and managed democracy its grotesquely dishonest for the defeatists to tell us that were losing a fair fight as for their opinion that we should just give up i have one word no 
whenever you hear the defeatists crowing that this is inevitable or that we deserve it remember that they want to demoralize you and anyone else listening the same goes for when they tell you that loving your people and wanting your posterity to survive is hatred suppose someone is losing his home by a devious swindle orchestrated by crooks widely lauded for their fairness caring and honesty it would be the height of arrogance to tell the defrauded that he deserved it and should shut up about it and let it happen the depopulation and population replacement agenda first the eu has to accept at least a million asylumseekers annually for the foreseeable future the eu should provide  euros  per asylumseeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing healthcare and education costsand to make accepting refugees more appealing to member states 
dont be fooled this isnt happening because some vague invisible force called progress is pushing things inevitably in this direction no its being actively promoted by globalist interests that have adopted cultural marxism as a means of control 
why are native fertility rates declining below replacement level the major factors are women are encouraged to spend their s partying and their s trying to get rich in a cube farm encouraging them to to make starting a family last priority often leaves them very unhappy over the long term and many will miss the chance to begin good economy tends to be positively correlated with higher fertility rates during recessions births go down the implications are obvious if less tax money was taken from working citizens for costly social services programs and spitinyoureye wars then theyd be able to afford more children sending the guilty to prison instead of bailing them out when they crash the economy might be a good indirect measure too about a third of american babies conceived end up aborted  thanks feminism the same leftists who think this is wonderful will scream bloody murder whenever a savage killer on death row is executed but all thats another matter 
because of declining fertility rates the globalists tell us that we must open the floodgates of third world immigration to prop up the population and support the aging citizens so theyve fed us poison and to soothe the symptoms they want to feed us another kind of poison to hell with that 
granted keeping social security going in the usa will be a challenge still its pretty uncertain that newlyarriving immigrantsif they become the majoritywill be able or willing to support millions of elderly gringos as for future european retirees will they be well cared for by refugees from africa and the middle east the way things are now many of them prefer rioting  looting and collecting welfare over working so these are going to be the people propping up the european retirement programs 
dispossession is inevitable only if we let it happen for now we must educate the rest of the public about whats going on and convince them that their future is worth saving and their posterity is worth preserving once weve achieved critical mass we can confront the political establishment and get the government to start working for us rather than against us whats in it for us whenever someone writes that western civilization is nothing but injustice and oppression theyre using technology we invented to complain about us 
its fashionableespecially in academiato bash western civilization were not perfect but nobody else is either the truth is that were a creative dynamic and industrious people some of us are under the impression that we dont have any culture only other people do but thats mistaken i could spend all day listing our major artists composers poets philosophers writers theologians and the like but i only would scratch the surface 
other cultures have made notable contributionsparticularly east asia and the middle eastbut the fact is that the majority of science and technology that makes life comfortable today originated in the western world electricity motorized transportation refrigeration telecommunications computers need i go on yep that was us we shared our medical advances with the rest of the world increasing longevity and quality of life around the globe whether the worlds future looks more like star trek or more like blade runner may have a lot to do with whether or not our people survive 
finally most of us are going to live out our lives in our native countries do we want them to stay the same nations we grew up in some time in the future todays youth will be running the show while were elderly what kind of a place do we want it to be by then western civilization is great lets keep it going",prisonplanet.com,Fake,english,20.8,8.476806513105332,77,12,11183,1884,4.912951167728238,1884.0,0.4598726310629357,0.3616742515005802,2.170599541115376,2.175555757053255,-0.173863423001369,2.2380168163656973,0.0010615711252653,0.0,0.0005307855626326,0,1,0.0,0.0022546333249539,-0.9859,0.121,0.13,0.749,Negative,Very Strong

such acts could also be prohibited under the hatch act which bars the use of an official position to influence an election that is why the fbi presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election the usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment

this is the second complaint to be filed against fbi director comey the democratic coalition against trump has also filed a complaint against comey for interfering in a presidential election as a federal employee 
suspicion around comeys actions has grown as the fbi director is not expected to make any additional statements on this matter before the presidential election director comey appears to have set himself for problems after the election as senate democrats are making it known that they are open to holding hearings to investigate the fbi investigation if they win back the senate majority

she has focused instead on criticizing the russians as the source of the hacks despite the fact there is no proof of russian involvement 
the emails also shed light on how the clinton campaign interacts with wall street banks with friendly media and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of democratic rival bernie sanders with the help of the dnc

Dr. Patrick Slattery,national bugle radio the first step towards overthrowing jewish power,"share 
tulsi gabbard for secretary of state an example of the need for political realignment 
by dr patrick slattery  on monday donald trump met with hawaii congresswoman tulsi gabbard she has been mentioned as a possible secretary of state or even secretary of defense she is an iraq war combat veteran and major in the hawaii national guard its not just that she would be preferable in these jobs to john bolton rudi giuliani or mitt romney but is probably the very best candidate from the ranks of the washington establishment 
in particular she is unique in being a strong and principled opponent of any intervention in syria she wants the united states to stop supporting isis and other rebel groups and let the russians iranians and hezbollah help president assad defeat the jihadists and end the syrian civil war which is more an armed invasion than a real civil war this is exactly the right approach 
and its not just that she is on the right side of this issue it is her signature issue she is on the armed services and foreign affairs committees so this is what she has spent her time on 
its not that shes perfect it has been noted that she at the very least pays lipservice to israel everyone on capital hill does lets face it zionism is the established religion in america and there is a religious test for office but her fault goes further than that she condemned the government of thenukrainian president victor yanukovich in february  just as hillary clintons erstwhile secretary of state victoria nuland was organizing his overthrow gabbard like everyone else in congress then supported arming the jewishdominated government that nuland put in place in kiev 
even so her congressional website does not carry any mention of ukraine since  and her vocal opposition to starting world war iii with russia over syria seems to indicate that her view towards russia have become more realistic this as has been noted elsewhere is in line with trumps view 
but there is one more significant benefit of appointing gabbard as secretary of state it could help trigger a badly needed realignment of american politics as people like ralph nader have long been telling us there is no significant difference between democrats and republicans that is because the most divisive issues in politics are not the existential issues that face our society and the world 
if there has been one litmus test in politics during my lifetime it has been abortion it may engender strong emotions but it hardly ranks with nuclear war as a threat to humanity yet i cannot tell you how many staunchly antiwar people in  voted for prowar democrat john kerry because they were worried about bush appointing prolife judges to the supreme court talk about getting your priorities backwards 
this year despite senior statesmen like mikhail gorbachev warning us that the threat of a nuclear world war iii has never been higher foreign policy was all but absent from the campaign only nonmainstream elements like the paleoconservatives the altright greens and stray individuals from the old left like stephen f cohen managed to finally get it injected into the campaign just in the nick of time in such a close election one could certainly make the case that this made the difference 
at this point in time war has to be the top priority as important as immigration may be what difference will it make in a postapocalyptic mad max world of course if we could organize around opposing jewish power it would take care of war but far too few people are awake enough to make this possible in fact israel currently has no role as an organizing feature in americas political alignment as both parties so unanimously support it blindly but as the realignment proceeds along an america first noninterventionist foreign policy an america first immigration policy is a natural outcome 
if trump embraces gabbard and rejects the neocons and their goy toys like mitt romney it would really help clarify the sides in this struggle party labels mean nothing romney and ryan and the like already revealed themselves by opposing trump there are tons of people outside of the republican party who could conceivably rally around trumps foreign and other policies and it is imperative that the donald make a point of bringing in some of these people into high profile positions while visibly snubbing his true enemies from within the republican party",davidduke.com,Real,ignore,94.81395100814586,87.55704798984418,69,10,4408,750,4.858666666666666,750.0,0.2152723163182744,-0.0141271790859303,0.3781264801288133,0.3978057411209067,-0.227436901832734,0.41870370242373,0.0053333333333333,0.0,0.0026666666666666,0,2,0.0,0.0113272778245686,0.29316,0.0762,0.0702,0.8535999999999999,Positive,Moderate

Henry Wolff,black turnout soft in early voting boding ill for hillary clinton,"loading posted on november   this professor devotes her life to countering dangerous speech she cant ignore donald trumps colby itkowitz washington post october   
when susan benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence her research took her to farflung places like kenya and burma 
lately shes been unable to ignore a case study at home in the united states 
the american university law professor and harvard university faculty associate has grappled for months with whether donald trumps rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it she has examined electionyear speech before but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great 
but in the past week with trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups she said 
benesch  has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech to rise to that level at least two of these five indicators must be true a powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience the audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate a speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence a social or historical context that is propitious for violence for any of a variety of reasons including longstanding competition between groups for resources lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence a means of dissemination that is influential in itself for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience 
trumps speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it benesch said in a recent interview the meaning is so often ambiguous 
but when trump said his supporters could use the second amendment against hillary clinton it seems to me impossible that people didnt understand that as a reference to violence she said or when he suggested that clinton and president obama were founders of the islamic state something he alluded to again at wednesdays final debate that was a hallmark of dangerous speech to describe an ingroup member as the enemy she said 
and now with trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him hes definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting direct incitement of violence is illegal but trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience 
because of that its still a gray area that surrounds whether trump does use dangerous speech 
trump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of us democracy benesch said some of themthose who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messagesmay therefore be more likely to commit violence however the united states is not in danger of mass intergroup violence in my view it is deeply irresponsible though since it can undermine some americans belief in our own democratic institutions which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward

last night a leaked memo was revealed indicating fbi director james comeys stated reasons for reopening the clinton email probe upon discovering what now appear to be tens of thousands of huma abedin emails located on anthony weiners notebook comey revealed two core reasons for the action a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup what he did not reveal and as has emerged overnight from a report by the new yorkers jane mayer is that comey also acted in contravention to doj practices and more importantly acted contrary to the preference of doj head loretta lynch whose infamous meeting with bill clinton on the phoenix tarmac at the end of june will likely be reassessed in light of these latest revelations 


according to the new yorker comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  
traditionally the justice department has advised prosecutors and law enforcement to avoid any appearance of meddling in the outcome of elections even if it means holding off on pressing cases  one former senior official recalled that janet reno the attorney general under bill clinton completely shut down the prosecution of a politically sensitive criminal target prior to an election  she was adamantanything that could influence the election had to go dark the former official said please go to zero hedge to read the entire article",abeldanger.net,Fake,english,18.593054831360817,9.779184157834,8,2,1883,308,5.074675324675325,308.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,-0.2899169854049241,-0.2951091680872924,-0.0142575404880916,-0.2904112855501232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.6314,0.037,0.047,0.915,Negative,Strong

EdJenner,obama talks about himself  times in speeches supposedly about hillary," things you need to know about trump and sex slave island by amanda prestigiacomo may   
presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at hillary clinton when it comes to her husbands escapades the kitchen sink in this case is jeffery epsteins sex slave island and president bill clintons ties to it  
why wouldnt trump use this ammo the answer is simple trump himself has ties to epstein the billionaire democratic donor and convicted pedophile known for having underage sex slaves on his private plane and what the media calls sex slave island 
here are seven connections between trump and epsteins sex slave endeavors that you need to know about 
 trump himself has said that epstein is a lot of fun to be with adding that he admired the sex offenders affinity for beautiful women on the younger side 
ive known jeff for fifteen years terrific guy trump once said about the convicted sex offender hes a lot of fun to be with it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as i do and many of them are on the younger side no doubt about it  jeffrey enjoys his social life 
 trump was named in epsteins little black book 
epsteins  little black book  was stolen by a former employee in  the book nicknamed the holy grail by the employee revealed the name of donald trump and listed  phone numbers including emergency numbers car numbers and numbers to trumps security guard and houseman 
 trump has allegedly flown on epsteins private plane  a hot spot for underage sex orgies 
mark epstein jeffreys brother testified in  that trump flew on jeffreys private jet at least once reports vice news  meanwhile message pads see below from epsteins palm beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by vice news indicate that trump called epstein twice in november of  
epsteins private boeing  according to one of his alleged victims virginia roberts was nicknamed the lolita express roberts recalled unsavoury sex orgies on the private plane when she was just  years of age with epstein and his friends 
 both trump and epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an underaged girl 
radar online reports that a woman in california identified as katie johnson filed a  million lawsuit against trump on april  accusing the real estate mogul of raping her when she was just  years old 
johnson claims trump raped her when she was yearsold and forced her to engage in sex acts by threatening to harm her and her family notes the independent uk  she claims the alleged abuse took place over a fourmonth period at underage sex parties held in new york city in  epstein was also named for alleged sexual misconduct and threats 
trumps team adamantly denies the accusation suspecting the claim is possibly a hoax since there is allegedly no evidence the plaintiff actually exists 
 epstein admitted to knowing trump under oath and curiously pled the fifth to trump attending sex parties with underage girls 
back in  epstein admitted to socializing with trump but when a lawyer representing an underaged victim of epsteins asked if he has ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of  epstein curiously pled the fifth per vice news  q have you ever had a personal relationship with donald trump a what do you mean by personal relationship sir q have you socialized with him a yes sir q yes a yes sir q have you ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of  a though id like to answer that question at least today im going to have to assert my fifth sixth and th amendment rights sir 
 at least one of epsteins underage sex victims was recruited from trumps maralago  which he frequented often 
virginia roberts an alleged victim of epsteins was recruited to perform a massage for epstein while working as a perhour locker room attendant at maralago 
roberts claims that epstein turned her into a sex slave and pimped her out to various friends including englands prince andrew over the years the passengers on epsteins jet she said included a whole bunch of other girls sometimes famous people sometimes some politicians 
 trump was subpoenaed in  for his connection to epsteins underage sex slave rings trump has denied ever being served 
in  trump was subpoenaed in a case against epstein concerning victim virginia roberts trumps attorney alan garten said that the subpoena never happened 
there is no debate over what happened said one of roberts attorneys i served mr trump with a subpoena for deposition in  he talked to me voluntarily and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information i cant imagine there being any dispute of any of this 
additionally garten told vice news in january that mr trump has no relationship with epstein other than the democratic donor frequenting trumps maralago a lot of people hung out there including jeffrey epstein said garten that is the only connection 
according to the evidence however the connections with epstein appear to go a lot deeper than that tags",dailywire.com,Real,english,99.09687615386632,93.82490884357614,69,10,5078,862,4.823665893271461,862.0,0.2152723163182744,-0.0141271790859303,0.5553894987060822,0.5733859896080522,-0.2619792326251379,0.5983889482451589,0.0011600928074245,0.0,0.0011600928074245,0,0,0.0,0.0020542489239143,-0.9834,0.078,0.11,0.812,Negative,Very Strong
Sarah Jones,reality slaps donald trump in the face as us economy roars back,"by sarah jones on tue nov st  at  am the united states district court in new jersey ordered discovery on donald trump and the rncs poll monitoring efforts with a hearing on november th just days before the november th election share on twitter print this post 
republicans are being ordered to explain their comments that they will be monitoring the polls for voter fraud 
the united states district court in new jersey ordered discovery on donald trump and the rncs poll monitoring efforts with a hearing on november th just days before the november th election 
the order demands affidavits from several parties including from someone with personal knowledge about the defendants rncs efforts with the trump campaign to monitor precincts around the country as indicated by kellyanne conway 
affidavits are also demanded from several republican operatives in various states who are said to be conducting state wide voter fraud monitoring and poll monitoring such as rnc member rob gleasons efforts to recruit persons to act as poll watchers in philadelphia pennsylvania and rnc member ronna romney mcdaniels efforts in michigan to prepare a massive statewide antivoter fraud effort 
the rnc must also answer for governor mike pences comments that the trump campaign is working with state governments and secretaries of state to ensure ballot integrity 
this is what happens when you have zero regard for election law and try to go vigilante 
rick hasen at election law blog noted that the discovery granted is pretty broad pretty broad discovery required in short order with hearing on november  
however the judge rejected much of the discovery sought by the dnc given the time frame but this should alone should be pretty educational on what efforts are actually going on behind the scenes 
the dnc filed a lawsuit against the republican national committee for violating a  court order intended to prevent voter intimidation over donald trumps claims that the election is rigged and that his supporters need to go to the polls to intimidate voters 
donald trumps urging that his supporters go to polling places other than their own often in urban areas to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree and the court isnt likely to stand for it 
so now discovery has been courtordered which is just more bad news for republicans who are already facing an uphill battle in their bid for the white house 
its exceptionally unpatriotic to try to intimidate fellow citizens from exercising their right to vote everyone has the right to vote free of intimidation dont let anyone dissuade you from voting

Jason Easley,bernie sanders says what the media wont trump is a gutless political coward,"by sarah jones on sun oct th  at  pm senator harry reid dropped the bomb that the fbi and national security experts possess explosive information about ties and coordination between russia and donald trump and his campaign share on twitter print this post 
talk about burying the lede 
in senator harry reids letter in which he suggests that fbi director james comey may have broken the law the hatch law he also drops the bomb that the fbi and national security experts possess explosive information about ties and coordination between russia and donald trump and his campaign 
reid writes in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between donald trump his top advisors and the russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the united states which trump praises at every opportunity 
reid points out the disturbing double standard in comeys treatment of sensitive information between the two parties with a clear intent to aid one over the other 
if the fbi and national security experts have information that donald trump and or his campaign are colluding or collaborating to bring about a particular result regarding the us election or our foreign policy stances this is an emergency 
which issue is so much of an emergency that a federal official might consider dropping the bomb just  days before an election electing someone who is conspiring with russia or electing someone whose aide may have sent an email she forget to tell everyone about 
the double standard is not only troubling at this point but dangerous 
bomb dropped 
everyone already suspected trumps ties to russia and his campaign has been full of ties to the kremlin but now reid has confirmed information about coordination between trump and russia 
now that ladies and gentlemen is an october shocker 
reids full letter follows 
dear director comey 
your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election through your partisan actions you may have broken the law 
the double standard established by your actions is clear 
in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between donald trump his top advisors and the russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the united states which trump praises at every opportunity the public has a right to know this information i wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public there is no danger to american interests from releasing it and yet you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information 
by contrast as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary clinton you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible 
moreover in tarring secretary clinton with thin innuendo you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own department you rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election despite the fact that for all you know the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated secretary clinton 
as you know a memo authored by deputy attorney general sally yates on march   makes clear that all justice department employees including you are subject to the hatch act the memo defines the political activity prohibited under the hatch act as activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party candidate for partisan political office or partisan political group 
the clear doublestandard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information along with your timing was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group 
please keep in mind that i have been a supporter of yours in the past when republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position i led the fight to get you confirmed because i believed you to be a principled public servant 
with the deepest regret i now see that i was wrong

Letsbereal,no title," more emotions men should master  more emotions men should master 
andré is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   mind 
passions and emotions are an almost bottomless pit start digging there and you will find new ones or new relations between this and that tidbit of emotional content socalled enlightenment philosophers who tried to theorize the passionssomething that had been done at greater length actually by thomas aquinascould never agree on how many there were or even how much they exactly mattered in the course of life 
whether or not you have been reading my last two pieces on the topic remember this is about mastering passions in the most general sense this is not only about emotional restraint or seduction our own emotional states are the first in line but mastering the passions is also about spotting what other people are feeling how they can be led to a specific course of action and what tends to make them tick mastering the passions is far from evident it rather takes times and experience the concepts and directions i am providing here aim at giving some conscious clarity about things that are by nature a bit muddy 
artists though they often suffer from mental problems are skilled at painting a particular vision in vivid colours allowing their public to share a specific point of view and emotional state this is something the elite know very well critics trashed ayn rands atlas shrugged because they could see themselves painted there as passiveaggressive cultural parasites rands novel was more cogent and attracted more heat than her barely original philosophical pieces today sold at the cheapest price on the secondhand book market 
more recently the movie the fall  got backlashed by some of the mainstream media on the grounds that it depicted hitler as too human while seeing actor bruno ganz pondering eating talking to his closest company or getting angry the viewer could perhaps feel a bit of empathy to him which is of course unacceptable to a left that clings to the idea of a crazy careless inhuman dictator to be forever cast as an embodiment of evil hollywood directors do not like witnessing others competing with their own emotional mastery 
we need artists as well as qualified cultural critics to take some distance from the mainstream propaganda disguised as entertainment and expand an alternative culture and artworks emotions explored in the present series can be used just that way  gratitude 
gratitude denotes a trained and refined disposition being graceful means recognizing that the good in our life can come from something that is outside us and outside our control neel burton heaven and hell  chap p it focuses on positive things we already have and that cannot be ascribed to our sole merit or efforts 
the traditional world whatever the particular cultural or religious form it was embodied into always emphasized the necessity of being grateful you owed your existence to god to your family and your community none of these goods were actually deserved which meant you had to be grateful for them and repay them by being a dutiful member of the community as well as a dutiful father for your own children a lot of prayers and ancient rites imply a thanksgiving for what one already has 
moving later in time it is striking to see that modern progressivism breeds the exact opposite mindset the ideology of rights make many goods granted not a thank you for but an i have a right to neophilia the relentless pursuit of novelty always casts a bad shadow on what has been around for some time as if what was coming later was always better 
advertisement gossip culture economic growth pressure quest for victimhood lead to envy and always being more or less frustrated with what one already has regardless of what it is by leading us to always want more progressivism makes us oblivious to what we already have or how it does not stem from pure individual meritand when it flatters the ego it makes us complacent and far from cultivating the art of being thankful 
turning our backs from the modern ungraceful mindset is easier said than done to start with loudmouthed girls should be remembered they owe their nice luxurious workplaces to the men who built them lgbtbbq should thank their heterosexual parents and ancestors for their very lives antiwhite black activists should remember they would not even exist had their ancestors not benefited from their white colonizers healthcare technology feel free to expand the list ultimately i think every person who is modern or westernized enough can be outed as ungraceful for something  trust 
a famous study showed that multiculturalism was closely correlated with defiance and a lack of trust in each other provided that we enlarge a bit our definition of multiculturalism this absolutely makes sense some ethnic groups are especially prone to violence and some minority groups are rewarded for freely accusing the silent majority but the hegemony of political correctness made it a taboo communities have been fragmented by individualism ie each person looking to take as much as she can and by an antiracist white guilt that soon became an intrawhite generalized suspicion of racism people do not identify anymore with the larger society and often cannot even identify with a smaller communitywhich makes everyone else a potential enemy 
yet without trust life becomes unbearable if you cant go to the streets without the possibility of getting mugged by say blm activists  or go to a family meal without the prospect of a lukewarm struggle with aging leftist parents or have a relationship with a girl without the possibility of her making a false rape accusation  there arent a lot of things you can do on the long run without trust in other people you have to trust the complex of big corporations ngo and state institutions we call the systemand be dependent from it for things as basic as food and shelter 
only trust in each other can make life sustainable and longterm projects workable to recreate trust we have to make people accountable and bound to precise rules reward good behaviours while punishing bad ones actions must bear consequences but before neomasculinity gets into power men should strive to establish a reputation through reliability persistence and a strong mindset i could wager you have been more trusting of your facebook friends last years than of the mainstream media  the former conveying more trustworthy information than the latter  desire 
modern capitalism and progressivism always ran on desire want cheaper prices more goods better goods more tv channels to watch more monies more ego and thinking you are the hot shit well just buy in x or do some work for y and here it is um nah you just have to do some more and some more and some more in the end you forgot why exactly you are doing what youre doing or why you started to watch tv but it all started with you led to perform something no matter how surreptitiously framed as spontaneous or normal it was 
the system plays on desires in three ways it sets things to be desired things to be feared or never desired at all and things to be consummated without end things to be desired include everything the advertisement wants you to desire like a revolving credit a new sofa an suv or whatever as well as the next step of  progress  as it has been elaborated on the top of the pyramid 
things to be feared are where the system wants you to be resigned and fatalistic did you ever feel sad to see all these girls losing themselves into a sea of fat bitching and sjwpropaganda spouting too bad thats globalization resistance is futile move on at last things to be consummated are mainly produced to keep you busy and programmed though you are not really practising anything beyond staring at a screen 
lately an important shift has been happening between the first and third ways to play on desires decades before the average consumer had to desire owning more junk or being part of the progress the system needed him to work and monitor his peers today the junk is already everywhere pc culture is already hegemonic and the average american worker is no longer needed active desire is not needed anymore 
thus the system has shifted into making the average joe more passive instead of actually desiring more the consumer should be content with surrogates of everythingpseudogroup identity with team sports pseudosports with football and basket on tv pseudosex with porn pseudolife with video games pseudofamily life with animals pseudoexpertise when the average libtard obnoxiously parrots the media on everything this is brzezinskis tittytainment in a nutshell 
even if you dont give up on having a real life instead of a surrogate the system will still want you to desire things only for yourself thus retreating into individualism instead of trying to actually weight on the world either you surrender to the progress or you try to ignore it before it comes for you as if nothing could change 
dont let the elite frame the world according to its own interests desire selfrealization and weighting on the course of the world of course our female counterparts should desire being loving caretaking and definitely on our side to conclude this series 
once again it is hard to sketch in a few words what could be done with passions or emotions what i have mostly dwelled into is how those already in power manipulate them and what we could do as to take them back if you find the topic worthy of interest you can expand it in two directions first documenting yourself on a particular passion or emotion and second using some by stirring it with a certain aim in mind 
in the former case i would recommend neel burtons heaven and hell quoted several times in the course of this series as a point of departure in the latter being creative or simply assertive is up to you whether this looks more like efforts or selfpersuasion or artistry does not matter much 
here as well as in seduction a tight framing is key whatever the topic no vocabulary and no picture are really neutral which is a problem as our perception and thinking orientation are often conditioned by these the mastery of emotions is reinforcedand reinforcesthe mastery of representations if this sounds farfetched let me provide some examples of use examples you are absolutely free to expand as it suits you 
in the comments space several guys here have been giving a very negative portrayal of the nice guy he would be a fake a sneaky bastard a jerk so guys who want to get laid or have their own interests just as everyone else are jerks this looks like internalized feminist thinking in my opinion nice guys should elicit empathy which goes through a positive portrayal emphasizing their willingness to respect the girl or how they were likely raised by an unmanly culture 
a recent rok piece about mainstream media has shown how these are making a conscious effort to hide and delegimitate white victimhood they paint vividly any crime where the victim is nonwhite and the perpetrator is but mention no detail or do not mention at all any crime perpetrated by nonwhites on whites 
the same pattern appears in the movie elysium  when the of course white villain mentions children she wants to protect from a mass of brown invaders yet these children are never shown and consequently stir no empathy from the average watcher whereas the brownskinned are vividly depicted as humane and not responsible for their own poverty 
analyzing these phenomena is fine but ultimately insufficient creative people on our side have to provide an alternative that includes mastered emotions picking up girls is part of and gives some experience in this wider game",prisonplanet.com,Fake,english,20.8,8.476806513105332,8,2,11882,2025,4.84641975308642,2025.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,2.355535138108676,2.3965987484522504,-0.2395234044736387,2.4642277061944604,0.0014814814814814,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0022371502971756,0.9984,0.156,0.113,0.731,Positive,Very Strong

the attack appeared to have been mostly launched by militants from outside the city against government forces that hold its western districts reuters news agency reported 
the socalled syrian observatory for human right said militants had set off several car bombs on the western edge of aleppo after launching grad rockets at the citys nairab airbase 
heavy militant bombardment with more than  rockets and shells struck districts on the southwest of the city it said 
the syrian military said a militant attack in that area had been thwarted and the army had destroyed four car bombs 
the massive assault by foreignbacked militants comes in the wake of a unilateral humanitarian pause declared by syria and russia in the city 
on thursday the russian defense ministry said aircraft had not carried out any sorties over aleppo for the past nine days there were no immediate indication on friday whether the airstrikes had resumed 
militants used a usrussian ceasefire to break the siege in early august opening up a new route into the city from the south but government forces quickly closed it

Fiona Miller,big pharma targets profits in rare diseases,"is deindustrialization a natural phenomenon of developed economies increasing real revenues affect peoples lifestyle choices jörg guido hülsmann  misesorg   
let me first state my position and then add a few arguments to back it up 
economic growth typically entails a reallocation of labor away from industrial production but it does not all by itself lead to falling industrial output the decline of industrial production in the us and france in the past thirty years is to some extent due to capital exports but especially to government interventionism in the form of mushrooming labor business and financial regulations education policies social security funding and taxation this decline cannot be stopped through more interventions even if they are designed with the good intention to reindustrialize the country 
now let me offer a few considerations in support of these contentions 
the reallocation of labor in a growing economy results most notably from capital accumulation and from changing preferences of the workingage population further investments and extensions of the existing structure of production make it necessary to spend more time devising new methods preparing industrial activity coordinating and monitoring supply chains lowquality bluecollar labor diminishes whereas there is some increase in highquality bluecollars but especially an increase in whitecollars working in and around the supply chains 
increasing real revenues affect peoples lifestyle choices rather than laboring long hours that provide essentially a monetary reward they increasingly prefer enjoyable activities that provide immediate psychological and emotional rewards thus the blossoming of artistic intellectual and scientific activities in developed countries at the expense of traditional industrial pursuits 
as a natural consequence of economic growth therefore industrial production declines relative to what it could be if it attracted even more people but this does neither imply a shrinking physical industrial output nor does it imply shrinking industrial revenues capital accumulation and technological progress make it possible that industry thrives even when less people have industrial employment germany provides an example 
in the past thirty years western capitalists have invested large amounts of capital in formerly communist countries of the east and far east this reallocation of capital though beneficial from the overall point of view of the world economy has been detrimental in the shortrun to the industrial development of those western countries where the capital would otherwise have been used 
but capital investments in countries such as france and the us have declined even more as a result of mushrooming government interventions welfare checks diminish the incentive to accept lowpaying and nongratifying industrial jobs massive subsidies for secondary and higher education artificially prolong schooling reduce the supply of qualified manual labor and create an artificial bias among the workingage population for scientific intellectual and artistic activities panoply of regulations have on the one hand increased the costs of doing business and on the other hand stimulated rentseeking and manifold forms of evasion and regulatory arbitrage today they are feeding entire armies of lawyers accountants auditors and financial advisors all at the expense of ordinary business 
these tendencies cannot be stopped through socalled reindustrialization policies which boil down to even more government spending premised on the spurious notion that irresponsible and often also inexperienced politicians know best how to use the available scarce resources such policies have utterly failed in the past airbus included and will fail in the future genuine reindustrialization requires more oxygen for industry it requires nothing less than a rollback of the artificial obstacles for industrial development that government interventions have created in past generations",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,6.250377223837964,43,7,3996,582,5.847079037800687,582.0,-0.579678706601875,-0.5778293249656962,0.2691229522872688,0.1344353683901885,0.7480291742309763,0.1491758336915867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9974,0.151,0.034,0.815,Positive,Very Strong

as red pill and coldblooded as it gets 
brother brat in russian is a  movie directed by alexey balabanov it is seen by many as the one of the greatest gangster movie of all time and changed forever the image of the traditional justiceseeking hero
it has been a few years at least that i want to share my discovery of this film with our readers it had a tremendous impact on the way i see the world and the attitude i have towards life i was convinced of its quality of the impact it could have on the disciples of the red pill and that a few lines cannot do justice to this giant of russian cinema culture it entirely deserves an article of its own
my brother the criminal 
enter danila bagrov played by the stellar sergey bodrov who died at  at the peak of his meteorlike career many called him the russian james dean
after serving in the bloody war theatre of chechnya young veteran danila returns home in the sleepy provincial town of tula
needing money and without any solid prospects he joins his brother vytia who works as a hitman for the local welldressed businessman in saint petersburg being an expert in making rudimentary weapons and with his quick capacity of reaction and frugality danila adapts marvelously to his new occupation

after seeing the risk of a gifted concurrent stealing their livelihood the citys gangsters soon put a price on his head and send a few professionals to tie up this loose end but even after being betrayed by a mix of greed and cowardice young danila bagrov decides to take on the mob single handedly
an epitome of the russian alpha hard and unforgiving sober in words and in behaviour for whom nothing counts more than the bonds of blood and brotherhood
to err is human 
his one soft spot is the faith he has in human nature convinced that if he does good his fellow man will be virtuous in return he could not be more wrong especially with women he discovers very fast that beta moves like buying them gifts and helping them only brings him trouble or ungratefulness
what is rare and makes danila stand out is his loyalty a cornerstone of the definition of masculinity and a value that progressively vanishes nowadays his brother will do the unthinkable but after the storm clears and danila emerges victorious he proves once more his quality as a man by being magnanimous and giving him a second chance
no fancy green screen or politically correct themes 
brat is good because it is painfully real and does not embellish the lawless chaos that was early postsoviet russia this is how it felt when the wall came down everyone was trying to survive the best way they could
the odd lowquality orange filter used in the film reminds us of this period where everything was made from what people could find when the shelves where empty
you cannot go wrong with a good revenge movie and danila is an example of bravery alone and against all odds he takes on the mafia that wronged him and will make them pay
the man says it like it is his analysis of the city and its perverse influence on men is brutally accurate

danila you told me about the city about its strength but here everyone is weak
hoffman the city is a great and terrible force it sucks the life force out of the strong  turns them weak it takes away your power and you fell right in the middle of it
his opinion about the abuse of power and the corrupt elites that would kill mother and father for their own profit and the final victory of truth applies especially well to todays political and social context

american whats your power is it really money my brother says its money youve got lots of money  so what
truth is a real power whoever is right is strong you cheated on a man and took away his money did it make you stronger no it did not cause you are not right and the person you cheated on is that means hes stronger right
brother also drops lethal truths about women and their ways after spending all his roubles buying drinks and dope for a young interchangeable skank she tells danila

kate do you have condoms
danila why
kate why you really think i will give you back your money come here
two brothers for two majestic films 
the second volume simply titled brother  breaks the stereotype that sequels are always awful and is at least as good if not better than the original
same characters are followed but this time danilas brother in arms has been played by a crooked american businessman in touch with the muscovite mafia they attacked his brothers once more and he will have this time to cross the atlantic to reclaim what is rightfully his
again the movie is realistic gritty but has a lighter outlook on life whereas in the first volume the main character showed a sheer hatred for everything that came from america and corrupted his country the sequel that involves danilas adventures and clueless discovery of american culture often results in hilarious encounters

if the red pill was a religion danila bagrov could be its patron saint you can watch it legally following this link which includes english subtitles the firm kinokompania stv that produced the film decided to release it online the film being such a household name in russia and worldwide

Letsbereal,no title,"not since the miniskirt has there been something worn by so many women who should never have it on in the first place 
 alan sorrentino a sexagenarian gay man in his letter to a local rhode island newspaper
a senior citizen and selfdescribed short little gay italian in rhode island has been the victim of a vicious intimidation campaign by feminists with too much time on their hands after he wrote a newspaper letter saying that women over  should not wear yoga pants the backlash against alan sorrentino was vitriolic  women marched on his home which was publicly shared using the excuse that it was just a neighborhood protest
in retaliation for exercising his first amendment rights which you might have incorrectly thought encouraged violence given the heavyhanded feminist response sorrentino received threatening calls and explicit death threats publications such as the washington post regarded the shameful intimidation of an old man as some kind of fun outing rabid social media users and the protesters themselves also lost sight of the context of sorrentinos letter and later comments which pointed out that men rocking up to supermarkets in speedos would be considered inappropriate too
violent gay man whose fashion prescriptions in a newspaper reaching only a few thousand people are capable of disemboweling feminists and ejecting them into space
if anything the moronic march on sorrentinos home and throughout his neighborhood demonstrates the paucity of real issues women have to complain about for all the talk of the misogyny and patriarchy that triggered the march pun intended these women were able to assemble freely in one of the most liberal states in america and harass without interruption an old white male albeit not a straight one they evidently did not feel the fear they continually reference in their diatribes where were the saudistyle female dress code police or the rape squads of the rape culture they always talk about to teach them a lesson alas the dastardly misogyny and patriarchy must have chosen to remain invisible again
women tell men what to wear all the time i didnt see anyone staking out jennie prices home for telling her husband and other men what to wear image attribution martin spaven
it goes without saying that one of the biggest criticisms leveled by women towards their boyfriends or husbands is their allegedly bad fashion sense even beyond their relationships women have a penchant for sticking their noses into what a man wears from his sporting clothing and clubbing attire to his choice of bathing suit here in australia an entire media subindustry emerged to criticize our former conservative prime minister tony abbott for wearing socalled budgie smugglers whilst swimming and keeping fit
because alan sorrentino had  women obviously stalk his home for his fashion comments should men have stalked the residence of one jennie price a hack journalist from the daily mail  instead of celebrating her husbands decision to resist middleage decline and obesity through cycling price penned a ridiculous piece in  decrying socalled mamils middleaged men in lycra
she joined bbc journalist dominic casciani who equated men taking up the amateur sport with a midlife crisis  notwithstanding that men in lycra wouldnt get i or my readers off at least men wearing this fabric actually engage in exercise when they don it in the morning too when fewer folks are awake to see them by contrast yoga pants seem to be the default female fashion option for nonexercise more than physical exertion or even yoga
naturally had just three guys  let alone  or  made their intention to protestcycle their way through jennie prices neighborhood in britain the police would have been called the same can be said of any of the countless female journalists and female fashion experts who have opined on what men should or should not wear and lets not forget women telling each other what to wear a number of females make their careers out of critiquing what other women wear especially on the celebrity red carpet i wonder how many times for example then zombie and now dead zombie joan rivers found her home marched on by offended feminists after she berated either a piece of female fashion attire or the women wearing it
sending a tweet is violence but  people marching on someones house is notwhat world do we live in the national debt nah terrorism nah urban crime nah these folks are protesting fashion comments
at the start of this year i brought you the story of holly michelle wood  a putrid harvard phd candidate and feminist who went around calling white people awful after the now banned milo yiannopoulos simply retweeted woods criticisms of him fellow feminist catrin cooper used the cyber violence argument and tried to get a twitter stooge michael margolis to alert its founder jack dorsey we would not have the time to go through even a relatively small fraction of the other instances in which women who cannot argue their position online reframe criticism as misogyny or even outright violence
as alan sorrentino clearly feared for his safety during the march potentially hundreds or thousands of women gave themselves excuses for calling some man disagreeing with them online or in person violent a climate now exists where whatever words certain women finds offensive becomes the basis for stopping whatever theyre doing presumably not much and going after the person saying them in the most organized and appalling fashion

No Author,life career goals ftw  tips for asking the man whose hand is currently on your knee for a raise,email yoda is a sick elderly reptile who lives alone at a motel in a swamp hes an absolute mess and hes incapable of looking after himself do you think you have what it takes to be his livein caretaker  before we get started you need to understand that this is not a glamorous job yoda is miserable to be around he needs constant supervision and his hygiene is appalling caring for him is an aroundtheclock gig and it requires an extraordinary level of patience and compassion youre going to have to put up with a lot of bullshit thats okay im confident i can handle whatever challenges the job throws my way wow that sounds pretty difficult i suppose id just have to try my best and hope i do a good job honestly i dont really have any experience with anything like this i already know that i would do a terrible job  one of the most important aspects of the job is tending to yodas skincare needs his skin is dry flaky and covered in sores and it needs to be rubbed down several times a day with a special prescription lotion unfortunately yoda hates being touched and he wont let you put the lotion on without a fight sometimes hell spray you with his stink gland or try to bite you other times hell scurry underneath the couch and try to dig a hole in the floor to hide in frantically scratching at the carpet until his hooves are bloody and raw with this in mind how would you go about getting him to cooperate with you for his skin treatments using simple terms he can understand id explain to him why the skin treatments are necessary and id work with him to figure out what exactly he doesnt enjoy about them and then use that information to tailor the process for him so that its as painless and comfortable as possible i would trap him underneath a laundry basket until he burns off all his combative energy then once hes tuckered out i would pin him to the floor with my knee and apply the lotion to his skin as quickly as possible before he gets a second wind id spread a thin layer of the lotion around the inside of a garbage bag then id roll a tennis ball past yoda to create a distraction and while his attention is diverted i would run over and stuff him inside the garbage bag id shake him up and down inside the bag until his body was covered in lotion and then i would dump him out on a mat of paper towels to clean off any excess lotion i would really rather not touch his gross skin so id probably just leave the lotion out on the counter for him  yoda always makes a huge fuss about eating his fruits and vegetables and if he had his way he would live entirely off of slim jims how would you ensure that hes eating a healthy nutritious diet and not just slim jims i would make him healthy vegetarian slim jims out of ground mushrooms spices lentils and other wholesome ingredientshe wouldnt be able to tell the difference i would dip all of his slim jims in nail polish remover to make them taste horrible leaving him no choice but to eat the vegetables if he doesnt want to go hungry i would tell him that his nemesis count dooku is coming to spay him and the only way for him to get strong enough to fight back is if he fills himself up on powerful vitamins and minerals like the ones found in fruits and vegetables i would mash the fruits and vegetables into a paste and force the paste down his throat with my fingers  yoda spends hours each morning tending to a patch of weeds out back that he refers to as his crops its pretty harmlesshe mostly just sprays the hose and drags a rake around a bitbut if you dont keep an eye on him hell sneak away and try to find the chosen one thats what he calls the trasheating swamp pelican that lives in the pond behind the house its unclear why he thinks this pelican is so special but hes already given it his lightsaber and all of his money in an effort to help it defeat the dark side this is all nonsense of course and its important to make sure yoda doesnt give any more of his valuables to this bird what measures would you take to keep yoda away from the chosen one i would tether him to the house with a length of rope thats long enough for him to freely tend to his crops but too short for him to wander off to places he shouldnt be i would dress yoda in a vest covered in flashing lights and bells which would scare the pelican away should it ever try to approach shock collar i would shoot the pelican with a gun and then make yoda eat its disgusting meat so that he realizes that the bird isnt special  theres nothing in the world that yoda enjoys more than watching pornography however doing so gets him extremely riled up and his doctor has warned that his heart is no longer strong enough to handle excitement like this nonetheless yoda will still try to watch porn any chance he gets and the only way to curb this habit is to reprimand him when he does how would you reprimand yoda for watching porn i would revoke his tv and computer privileges for the rest of the day and have him use his time to do something constructive instead i would put an oven mitt over his head and ducttape it in place so hed be physically incapable of looking at pornor anything else for that matter i would leave the oven mitt over his head for an entire day i would strip off all his clothes and parade him around town so that he could see how it feels to have strangers stare at him when hes naked i would charge people  to take pictures with naked yoda and i would spend all the money on something he hates i would put him in the oven and pretend like i was going to cremate him and i would only take him out if he promised to never look at porn again  one thing to be aware of is that yoda is very afraid of airplanes if he hears a commercial jet flying overhead hell freak out and try to use the force to make it crash granted hes probably not strong enough anymore to actually cause any harm but just be aware that thats a thing he might do got it ill make sure he doesnt try to down any airplanes if yoda wants to make an airplane crash who am i to stop him  yoda has no family or friends but he does have a catfish named obiwan that he keeps in a cigar box next to his bed he talks quietly to the catfish for several hours each night but what he doesnt realize is that the catfish is dead yodas doctor is concerned that hes formed an unhealthy attachment to the catfish and he has strongly suggested taking the catfish away from him before he becomes any more emotionally invested in it how would you go about taking yodas catfish away from him while also minimizing the emotional devastation that will result from losing his treasured companion i would get yoda a fishbowl and his very own pet goldfish once he has a real live fish to take care of i trust hell begin losing interest in obiwan and i will then gradually start weaning the dead fish out of his life while yoda is sleeping i would secretly put a small speaker inside of obiwans belly and wirelessly connect it to a microphone that i could use to make the dead catfish talk then the following day when yoda is having his alone time with obiwan i would have the catfish say yoda if you truly care about me please flush me down the toilet so i can go live with my family in the sewer hopefully he would feel comfortable parting with his companion if he thought it was what the dead catfish wanted i would tell yoda that count dooku is coming to make obiwan into a delicious po boy sandwich and the only way for him to thwart his nemesis is to run outside and toss obiwan into the swamp pond so he can swim away to safety i would throw obiwan in the trash and then lock yoda in a cupboard until he stops crying get results results for do you have what it takes to be yodas livein caretaker you have what it takes to be yodas livein caretaker wow sounds like this is the perfect gig for you looking after yoda is a very demanding job but your thoughtfulness and patience would be the perfect counterbalance to his unpleasant lifestyle and turbulent behavior the force is definitely on your side

Nathaniel Mauka,distracted by election  noone resisted the deep states patriot act,"michael snyder 
i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate 
in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  
so what should the democrats do now 
if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process 
they would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place 
democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea 
but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th 
if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill 
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed 
so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee 
who would they choose 
lets take a look at the top five options 
 tim kaine 
he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him 
and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens 
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee 
 joe biden 
vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it 
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run 
but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau 
unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does 
biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers 
biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice 
 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders 
first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over 
secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this 
thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election 
so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list 
 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman 
so she is definitely a possibility 
but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies 
 michelle obama 
one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton 
and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think 
michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  
the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title 
when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her 
if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump 
of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point 
and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her 
in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen 
and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down

admin,obamacare architect laughs about skyrocketing premiums video,"american mirror october   
for at least the second time in the last several days cameras captured hillary clintons eyes acting strangely 
the behavior which doctors have told the american mirror appears to be disconjugate gaze  a common symptom of increased intracranial pressure or swelling of the brain  was evident again during a rally on wednesday in lake worth florida 
here are several more of the instances from today 
despite getting major coverage on the drudge report no mainstream news outlet has covered the apparent issue with clintons eyes 
but the several instances over the last few weeks and as recently as last friday  have been enough for doctors to publicly call on clinton to undergo a full medical example and release the results 
my rational self would say that they could have defused all this a long time ago by releasing her medical records and having her undergo the same type of neurologic exam that every high school football player in america who gets his bell rung on friday night must undergo before he can suit up for the game next friday dr john r coppedge a surgical specialist from texas told the american mirror  a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
she needs a full neurology evaluation neuroopthalmology evaluation mri cerebral venography and a lumbar puncture dr gerald gianoli an expert in intracranial pressure said to this news site 
it is possible that her status could be significantly improved but at the same time she risks demonstrating to the public that her medical problems are more serious than she has let on in the past 
gianoli who believes the condition could be the result of elevated pressure which can cause other problems 
it can lead to blindness deafness progressive vertigobalance problems seizuresstroke and continued problems with concentration memory and ability to mentally focus he said

Sean Brown,breaking wikileaks reveals hillarys campaign chair engages in satanic rituals,"posted on october   blacks and liberals want to abolish science dan roodt american renaissance october   the south african fallist movement finds another target 
on my recent visit to stockholm for the identitarian conference some swedes and i compared notes on whose country was the most crazyliberal and antiwhite the swedes pointed to a short video recently released by an ngo that said swedes should integrate into the culture of thirdworld immigrants to form a new country 
my swedish colleagues agreed with french author renaud camus writing on free west media  he argues that whereas white populations everywhere seem determined to be replaced by thirdworlders the case of sweden is even more tragic more extreme more insane nowhere else do a people and a nation show a stronger will to suicide 
but i believe south africa is worse we have actual laws regulations and policies that require corporations universities and sports bodies to replace whites our country has become the world champion of antiwhite antiwestern ideology together with our northern neighbor zimbabwe we are to multiculturalism what pol pots shortlived democratic kampuchea was to communism its most extreme expression pol pot waged genocide against the entire middle class of cambodia in order to start a new society 
south africas ruling elite also wants a new society that will be cleansed of western influences and even the white race as robert mugabe put it during his famous  visit to soweto i dont want to see a white face 
the current upheavals at our universitiesknown absurdly as the fallist movementhave been widely reported enraged black students egged on by understanding whites have demanded that one thing after another must fall each accompanied by its own hashtag first it was rhodesmustfall the statue of cecil rhodes at the university of cape town then afrikaansmustfall blacks want to eliminate afrikaans as a language of university instruction followed by feesmustfall they want tuition fees abolished and now sciencemustfall 
in a video that has had nearly a million views a female black student at the university of cape town called for science to be scrapped saying 
if i personally were committed to decolonization science as a whole is a product of western modernity and the whole thing should be scratched off so if you want practical solutions to how to decolonize science we have to restart science fromi dont knowfrom an african perspective from our perspective from how weve experienced science for instance i have a question for all the science people there is a place in kzn called umhlabuyalingana they believe that through the magic the black magicyou call it black magic they call it witchcraftyou are able to send lightening to strike someone can you explain that scientifically because its something that happens 
the initial reaction was widespread ridicule from ordinary whites but i knew that her dismissal of western science was not taking place in a vacuum and was connected with the culturalmarxist ideas swirling through most western universities after all herbert marcuse one of the founders of cultural marxism wrote this in an essay on liberation in  at the height of us student radicalism 
this is the hippie subculture tripgrasspotacid and so on but a far more subversive universe of discourse announces itself in the language of black militants here is a systematic linguistic rebellion which smashes the ideological context in which the words are employed and defined and places them into the opposite contextnegation of the established one thus the blacks take over some of the most sublime and sublimated concepts of western civilization desublimate and redefine them p  
needless to say marcuse approved of the black take over and if he were alive today he would surely applaud what is happening in south africa not only are blacks taking over western concepts and changing them into their opposites they are taking over our institutions as well 
in universities and the mainstream media there was actually praising this young fallist i was only slightly surprised to read a piece in afrikaans entitled  sciencemustfall nie so belaglik soos dit mag klink  sciencemustfall not so ridiculous as it sounds it was written by liezel de lange the managing director of our sunday newspaper rapport  which once supported apartheid and segregation 
miss de lange first confessed ignorance because she attended the university of pretoria in the days when it still taught western ideas and culture she laments that when she studied english literature almost all our prescribed works were from britain and ireland as well as the usa i have to give my lecturers at the time credit for assigning readings from wole soyinka chinua achebe and ngugi wa thiongo most westerners no doubt have deficient educations because they have not been taught ngugi wa thiongo 
although liezel de lange did not exactly endorse the sciencemustfall idea in defense of the young fallist she evoked the mythical medieval african university of timbuktu as evidence that africas vast contributions to world learning are being ignored in fact timbuktu was a center for islamic and tuareg schools not a hub of forgotten african or black science nor are africans themselves united in wanting to preserve what is left of the medieval african university recent al qaeda activity in the region has been so destructive that the new yorker recently ran a story called  has the great library of timbuktu been lost  
i asked liezel de lange on twitter whether she was an afrocentrist but she evaded the question answering that she merely posits that not all knowledge wisdom and insight come from the west its hard to disagree with that 
miss de langes column was just a watereddown version of a more radical piece she had read on the leftwing website the daily maverick by joel modiri called  in the fall decolonisation and the rejuvenation of the academic project in south africa  
mr modiri is a black academic at unisa university of south africa which has been racially transformedmeaning that whites have been all but banished it is africas largest correspondence university naturally founded by south african whites mr modiri explained that her the fallists error proves her point he decried 
the presentation of knowledge by south african universities as predominantly the product of the west and the failure to recognize that some of the major scientific disciplines medicine physics astronomy mathematics among others have deep heritages in africa china and india     
in other words she is a victim of the false eurocentric view that science is western to begin with some american blacks have long maintained that the west stole its knowledge from africa they never explain how science could be stolen from one people by another leaving no trace behind knowledge is not like the mona lisa which cannot exist in more than one place so it is strange that the wise africans who conceived of science and culture no longer possessed it once it was stolen from them 
but we have to remember samuel huntingtons dictum in his book the clash of civilizations and the remaking of world order  culture follows power if anything this is what the rest of the world might learn from south africa whoever dominates politically will impose his culture and beliefs even if they are more primitive than those it replaces once the scientist has been politically and culturally subjugated he may have to bow down to the witchdoctor 
unfortunately it is not only pseudointellectual blacks such as mr modiri who hate the west one of the most europhobic statements in support of the black uct student came from stuart theobald a whiteliberal english south african academic who divides his time between london and johannesburg 
in the same rapport that liezel de lange edits mr theobald writes of the need to decolonize science because it has been used to justify racism and to support biological racism he continues 
we are kidding ourselves if we pretend that colonial attitudes are not still affecting the way science works today this is why a deliberate effort to decolonise science is valuable and south african universities have the opportunity to lead the charge

Daniel Greenfield,obamacare is great we just need to punish people for not using it,"search what will replace isis this is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the west or to islam october   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
before long the same administration that declared the fighting in iraq over several times will claim victory over isis the timetable for its push against the islamic state appears to have less do with the victimized christians and yazidis who have been prevented from coming here as refugees in favor of syrian muslims than with the clinton presidential campaign like obamas declarations that the wars in afghanistan and iraq were over the announcement that isis has been defeated will be premature 
it is based on a profound misunderstanding and misreading of islamic terrorism 
long before its current string of defeats isis had begun evolving into another al qaeda a multinational alliance of jihadists scattered around the world bombing mosul isnt hard but try bombing marseille brussels or london there is no doubt that the ability of isis to temporarily establish a caliphate allowed it to build a network that could carry out terror attacks from new york to miami to nice to munich but it would be dangerous to assume that losing iraq and syria will stop isis 
isis doesnt matter the idea of isis does and the idea of isis is islamic supremacism 
the organization we think of isis has transformed and rebranded countless times even now our leaders vacillate between calling it isis isil or more childishly daesh while it dubs itself the islamic state we have been fighting it in one form or another for over a decade it would be unrealistically optimistic to assume that the war will end just as this old enemy has shown its ability to strike deep in our own cities 
the bigger error though is to think that we are fighting an organization we are fighting an idea that is not to contend as obama does that we can debate it to death it is not the sort of idea that argues with words but with bullets bombs and swords but neither does it just go away if you seize a city 
al qaeda in iraq not only survived the death of zarqawi but it became even more dangerous under baghdadi it would be risky to assume that isis will die with him instead it may very well grow into a new phase of al qaeda one that ties together some of the worlds deadliest islamic terror groups into a network that is decentralized enough that it will not suffer from al qaedas leadership fatigue 
the rise of islamic terrorism has been an incremental process in which new groups learn from the mistakes of the old and supersede them if isis does recede into a localized oblivion reemerging only on occasion to suicide bomb something or someone in baghdad then a deadlier and even more effective group is likely to take its place each group will move one step closer to realizing the caliphate 
to break the cycle we must confront the idea of the caliphate at the heart of islamic terrorism 
isis is not unislamic it is ruthlessly and uncompromisingly islamic in that unlike its predecessors in the muslim brotherhood and al qaeda it makes the fewest compromises to civilizational sensibilities its goals are the same as those of every islamic political organization including those dubbed moderate it seeks to restore and enforce an islamic system in every part of the muslim world before moving on to conquer and subjugate the nonmuslim world if this were merely some fringe belief held by a tiny minority of extremists then it could be bombed to pieces in some syrian or iraqi backwater 
but its the driving force of islam thats why it wont go away no amount of appeasement will banish it 
taking in more muslim settlers pressuring israel and letting the muslim brotherhood colonize our foreign policy wont do it weve tried it and it actually makes islamic terrorism much worse 
when the announcement is made the usual suspects will pat themselves on the back for having defeated isis by mobilizing a muslim coalition but it wasnt obama who mobilized a muslim coalition the coalition such as it was mobilized them obama provided useful support to islamic state sponsors of terror such as iran and turkey assorted islamic jihadists on the ground some blatantly associated with sunni and shiite terror groups in their internal jihadist conflict with isis over who will fight us 
the allies we are aiding today will be the ones bombing us tomorrow 
and that is why claiming credit for beating isis accomplishes nothing isis is an expression of an islamic impulse encoded in the koran islamic groups differ in the tactical expression of that impulse isis was nastier and uglier than most of the islamic terror groups we had dealt with before this though even it found its boko haram affiliate in nigeria occasionally a little too much to stomach 
if isis vanishes from the world stage islamic terrorism will be easier to dismiss or so the thinking goes the islamic state was better at viral videos than the media that tried to whitewash islamic terror it was hard to ignore but a scattering of islamic terror groups around the world will be forgotten by the public 
history suggests thats wishful thinking 
islamic terrorism has shown no signs of receding growing muslim populations both at home and in muslim settlements in the west and the increase in travel and communications the infrastructure of globalism spread it from the most backward to the most advanced parts of the world wealthy and unstable muslim countries rich in oil but poor in power finance its spread through mosques and guns 
these are the ingredients that give us isis or any other combination or letters that stands for islamic terror to do anything meaningful about it we would have to reverse the decline of the west 
islam originally spread into a vacuum created by civilizational decline civilizational decline is why it is rising once again an obscure local terror group eventually turned into isis by filling a power vacuum even as obama performs another touchdown dance some other group will be making that same journey its mission will be the familiar one of replacing our civilization with its own 
until we come to terms with this civilizational struggle we will go on fighting endless wars in the sand and coping with endless terror attacks in our own cities because we have failed to recognize the nature of the enemy we are not fighting an acronym whether its isis or isil we are fighting an islamic state

Daniel Barker,vermont fights the opioid epidemic by limiting prescribed painkillers,"keywords cavities  coconut oil  dental health  gingivitis  oil pulling  teeth 
we all know about the popular and ancient practice of oil pulling but many of us dont understand how this practice works or how exactly it benefits our teeth oil pulling began in ayurvedic medicine thousands of years ago and has achieved widespread popularity in modern society today 
but the question remainsdoes it help your smile and how 
the claims of oil pulling 
lets take a look at each of these popular claims of oil pulling 
it makes your mouth healthier by pulling out bad bacteria that can cause cavities and gum disease oil pulling can actually make your mouth healthier and even stop chronic bad breath 
it whitens teeth research has not proved this but some people claim they get whiter teeth with oil pulling this should be considered a side effect of oil pulling albeit a great one rather than its main purpose 
it heals cavities oil pulling can remove the bacteria and plaque that cause tooth decay but typically oil pulling alone is not enough to heal cavities you need to stop eating so much sugar get more vitamins and minerals such as k d and calcium and switch your toothpaste to help heal cavities with oil pulling 
it cures disease ancient cultures used oil pulling as a way to draw out toxins from the mouth to prevent them from affecting the body research doesnt show whether or not oil pulling can help any type of disease but research does link oral health to body healthso a healthy mouth could help you prevent heart disease  respiratory illnesses and even cognitive decline 
what the research says 
now that weve seen the popular claims of oil pulling lets find out what modern research actually says about this ageold practice 
research shows that oil pulling can actually the stop inflammation bacteria plaque and bad breath associated with gum disease therefore it may be an effective treatment for gum disease combined with a healthy diet and great oral health practices 
it can decrease the likelihood of tooth decay and reduce overall plaque content in the mouth oil pulling can also help prevent tooth loss and oral diseases such as oral cancer periodontal disease and oral thrush oil pulling may be able to reverse tooth decay but only when combined with other healthy practices 
although research hasnt proved that oil pulling helps decrease your chances for developing chronic disease keeping your mouth healthy and free of toxins can benefit your whole body 
the verdict 
if you want to give oil pulling a try do this practice every day put a tablespoon of oil in your mouth preferably sesame or coconut and swish it around for up to twenty minutes as soon as you wake up spit out in the trash then brush and floss your teeth as normal easy 
the verdict is in oil pulling can help you get a beautiful and healthy smile but it should not replace regular brushing and flossing as your oral care routine practice oil pulling first thing in the morning before you eat or brush then enjoy the benefits of a healthy smile without giving up your brushing and flossing habits you might also like",naturalnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,5.169608718030007,69,9,3108,539,4.7272727272727275,539.0,0.2152723163182744,-0.2020278943791856,0.0341833097550079,0.0670250944174451,-0.3571098341252615,0.0801895339565738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9975,0.201,0.079,0.721,Positive,Very Strong

rev dankof quoted an article by former reagan administration assistant treasury secretary paul craig roberts that goes farther than he has ever done before in identifying the jewish nature of the power establishment in america the very same establishment that is fighting presidentelect trump tooth and nail there seems to be the start of a sea change in which people are becoming more willing to point out that the emperor has no clothes

No Author,peshmerga forces wont enter iraqs mosul kurdish leader,"the daily sheeple october   
wikileaks continues to be a treasure trove of info about the behindthescenes rigging of what is turning out to be the most infamous presidential election in american history 
remember the first debate between hillary clinton and donald trump and the conspiracy surrounding podiumgate  
hillary required a specially built podium under the pretext that she didnt want to appear shorter than trump 
after the debate was over however a sneaky cleaner man was caught on tape approaching hillarys podium multiple times removing various items and looking as shady as possible while doing it what could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in trumps just after the debate officially ended 
this led to lots of speculation on whether or not hillary cheated during the first debate against trump and other debates as well having her comments fed to her 
well if the wikileaks podesta emails are any indication its very possible why a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
because apparently hillary cant give long speeches without a podium 
in fact these emails and this isnt even all of them but enough for you to get the picture prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept short and sweet unless hillary has a podium 
so how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow

daily wire editorinchief ben shapiro spoke at the university of wisconsinmadison on wednesday night and amid raucous leftist protesters who consistently tried to interrupt him and even blocked him from being seen by the audience by creating a human wall in front of him found a way to respond with hilarious repartee that left the audience howling and the protesters eventually filing meekly out of the auditorium 
after the ovation he received on entering shapiro quipped hey look at this a campus that doesnt actually try to arrest me when i come he continued before i begin i did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room i hear youve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how youre not one of these awful terrible trump people that youre sensitive and that you want to signal your virtue so ive brought along these safety pins holding up safety pins and i also brought you something to wear them with  this diaper 
shapiro then held up a diaper prompting huge laughs from the audience 
when a protester yelled at shapiro that he should be wearing a swastika shapiro held out his yarmulke then fired back in case you hadnt noticed the folks with the swastikas arent too nice to my type 
shapiro continued stop being selfindulgent children stop pretending that everybody who voted for trump is a vicious racist its your right to protest of course but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a dulyheld election  donald trump doesnt care about your protest donald trump is sitting somewhere in trump tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty salty tears 
referring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who werent university students from attending shapiros lecture shapiro opined i hear that a lot of folks at this publiclyfunded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants i do have a quick question if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally why are so many people trying to ban american citizens from this community from coming to this lecture and by the way im aware of this private facebook page titled f white supremacy interrupting ben shapiro with all due respect f you right back gang 
after the applause subsided and shapiro joked about how both black lives mater and the kkk target him the real fun began protesters stood up chanting shame over and over again 
shapiro quipped wow its like game of thrones  should i get undressed and walk down the aisle 
the bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters shapiro addressed the protesters saying im happy to talk with you but they responded by screaming safety over and over shapiro joked did somebody fart the crowd responded to the protesters by chanting usa 
shapiro replied i tell you try not to be children the first thing you do is start screaming like my twoyearold he added you see this is how conservatives actually treat people you stand up and you interrupt and you shout safety and youre perfectly safe look at that its amazing that provoked sustained applause 
when the protesters started screaming shame again shapiro eviscerated them pointing out if youre going to pick a chant like shame watch game of thrones first the bad guys shout shame the audience loved that line on a roll shapiro continued youre not changing anybodys mind all youre showing everybody is that your collective iq if it were channeled into electricity night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly 
he continued okay can we talk now or are you going to keep shouting nows your chance to get it out lets hear your feelings cmon just go for it or is it going to be like every thirty seconds like an annoying microwave timer 
when the protesters resumed chanting shapiro responded if you guys want to talk we can talk if you want to shout get the hell out more applause 
shapiro fired for gods sake at least wait until i say something that offends you before getting offended 
shapiro returned to deconstructing the term social justice when the protesters started again a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day and that they should shut freaking up and listen to the man speak that prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and shapiro too he added see thats what a decent hardworking person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime presumably 
shapiro returned to his speech racial diversity doesnt mean anything decency means everything  diversity isnt our strength decency is our strength he turned to the protesters remember that decency 
the protesters screamed back shame shapiro fired back decency the protesters chanted shame but the crowd soon joined shapiro in chanting decency shutting the protesters up 
as shapiro spoke of the falsity of white privilege the protesters formed a line in front of shapiro prompting him to quip if you guys are all going to come up here can we all just have circle time or something 
the protesters chanted safety for a minute and a half but then the crowd started yelling back free speech matters shapiro turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters morons that again prompted cheering 
one member of the audience yelled to the protesters at least tell us what you want or otherwise just get out that brought a sustained ovation 
after one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue the protesters started shouting safety again then filed out yelling f white supremacy while flipping off shapiro and the entire audience that prompted the crowd to sing nananana nananana hey hey goodbye it also promoted this from shapiro 
even after leaving the lecture hall protestors continued to pound on the door 
after shapiro explained why the protesters had not been arrested as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event he continued all i can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event 
even after leaving the lecture hall protestors continued to pound on the door prompting shapiro to quip doesnt this school give homework does anybody have a job around here i guess when youre majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands 
shapiro noted that he had engaged in a backandforth with one of the protesters who accused him of being a white supremacist when he asked her why she thought so she replied that she got that impression from his image he fired back really was it the yarmulke that did it for you 
he took another shot at the protesters during the speech noting that people were born unequal and adding some people us are born rich some of us are born poor some of us are born smart some of us are born protesters 
the rest of the speech was vintage shapiro as was the qa afterward even the chalk was impressive 
went back to the lecture hall and grabbed the exact piece of chalk benshapiro used to write morons factsnotfeelings onlyatyaf pictwittercomwchsagr  japheth patterson japhood november

No Author,tim kaine the catholic church will change its samesex marriage stance or it will be banned from the us,"email 

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow her or bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server to gunrunning to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi 
apparently hillary is not the only person in washington who has made plans to escape justice under a trump administration john kerry has quietly been selling his property in the us for millions of dollars of late with an announcement of the sale of his  million nantucket mansion in june  as well as the sale of his yacht for  million in july  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million seaside mansion in dubai in january  another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on  the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushs plan on getting out of the country as well 
interestingly the bush familys nazi connections dating back to wwii seem to have played a part in the paraguay purchase since most nazis fled to south america after wwii since george h w bushs father senator prescott bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the nazis the bush family has a long history of being associated with nazis 
with the movement of huge amounts of funds selling millions of dollars in real estate and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions murdering us citizens in the thousands and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since  finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed 
we are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a nazi dictatorship in washington to an actual presidential administration who not only will look to the constitution as the basis of all laws but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people for the people and of the people of the usa not the dictatorship over the people to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,102,19,4035,703,4.705547652916074,703.0,1.2242486146400025,1.6769792585533674,0.279441247398483,0.3241247439879082,-0.3785503519230738,0.3433000724808089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.9785,0.065,0.089,0.846,Negative,Very Strong

donald trumps inauguration may be months from now but it looks like his oval office transition is already well under way in addition to naming reince priebus his chief of staff and meeting with advisors on policy issues trump had to schedule in some time this week to go around to houses in the white houses neighborhood and inform residents that hes moving in down the street 
looks like trump is not wasting any time preparing for his big move to  pennsylvania avenuehello my name is donald trump and as a new resident in this community i am required to inform you that i have a history of sexually assaulting women said the presidentelect while standing on one of his new neighbors doorsteps in the past i have grabbed women inappropriately made multiple unwanted advances toward women and harassed women with vulgar and inflammatory language for this reason i have to go door to door telling residents of my new presence in the neighborhood sorry to bother you and have a nice day 
after spending most of tuesday exploring potential cabinet picks trump was later spotted going around the white houses neighborhood and knocking on doors continuing to alert his new neighbors to his history of sexual assault standing awkwardly on front porches and avoiding eye contact trump promised local residents that he wouldnt cause any trouble for them or their families and planned to mostly keep to himself for the next four years as president of the united states he then finished the day by meeting with several economic advisors 
itll be interesting to see what a trump presidency might look like as he spends the next few days crafting policy goals and reassuring his new neighbors that his motorcade will take alternate routes to ensure that he is never within a hundred yards of a school if he keeps making the rounds at this pace it wont be long before all of the residents of pennsylvania avenue have been made aware of his record of sexual assault

Bob Smith,two more hollywood films for men that leave todays sjw movies in the dust,"leave a reply mike adams  under fbi head james comey who has deliberately and clearly conspired to cover up the enormous number of crimes committed by hillary clinton and her closest staffers the fbis investigation of additional emails is now concluded we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton comey announced today 
with this decision james comey essentially announces that the tyranny of criminal government in washington is now complete  
the rule of law has just been declared null and void by the head of the fbi no sufficiently powerful person in washington will ever be held accountable for their crimes including crimes of treason against the nation bribery corruption destruction of evidence and selling government influence 
unless something reverses very quickly the fbi has now cemented its position as nothing more than a corrupt branch of a totalitarian criminal regime that has seized power in washington to protect the criminal class of political elitists who rule over the nation as lawless tyrants 
now its up to rogue fbi agents or the nypd to go public with the evidence they have and expose the horrifying truth about what the clintons really are pedophilia and all if that fails my analysis says we may see a rapid ramping up of real talk of open revolt  perhaps even leading to an armed citizens march on washington to depose the criminal regime in power as ive pointed out before that effort would only require a few thousand armed citizens to achieve the occupation of key government buildings and the overthrow of the criminals in power sadly it would also involve tremendous bloodshed and loss of life lets hope it doesnt come to that

last week the pentagon issued a defense department directive that allows department of defense dd personnel to carry firearms and employ deadly force while performing official duties 
the defense department has been working on changing the gunfree zones on domestic military basis for several years in light of the deadly shootings at military sites in recent years 
militarycom reports that the directive also provides detailed guidance to the services for permitting soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard personnel to carry privately owned firearms on dod property it authorizes commanders  and aboveto grant permission to dod personnel requesting to carry a privately owned firearm concealed or open carry on dod property for a personal protection purpose not related to performance of an official duty or status 
the directive also makes clear that dod will consider further changes to grant standard authorizations for other dod personnel who are trained in the scaled use of force or who have been previously qualified to use a governmentissued firearm to carry a firearm in the performance of official duties on dod property this would allow dod with certain combat training to carry firearms without going through the additional step of making application with a commander 
kim smith at conservative tribune notes that the policy was a response to an nrabacked provision in the  national defense authorization act that required the defense department to allow more service members to carry firearms on base 
it is a good first step in that it recognizes personal protection is a valid issue for service members but there are many roadblocks in the way of making that option available nra spokeswoman jennifer baker told the washington free beacon  
those wishing to apply for permission to carry a firearm must be at least  years old and meet all federal state and local laws the directive said 
it would appear that the pentagon saw no problems with implementing a policy for which presidentelect donald trump has expressed support 
presidentelect donald trump ran on removing gunfree zones from military bases on july   breitbart news reported that trump pledged to end the gunfree scenarios for us troops by mandating that soldiers remain armed and on alert at our military bases 
the immediate institution of this directive probably left president barack obama incensed but he undoubtedly realized that there was nothing he could do to prevent its implementation in a couple of months anyway and thats good news because it works to ensure the safety of our troops which should always be a priority

Ron Smith,no title," shares
   
in last issue of black agenda report i argued that readers should vote for the green party this november this week i will outline what to expect from a hillary clinton presidency the great migration of republicans into the democratic party tent of hillary clinton has guaranteed her victory in the highly undemocratic us presidential elections corporate media outlets have collaborated with clinton to instill deep popular fear of a trump administration fear of trump has been used to distract the many millions of people in the us who are fed up with both corporate parties this has led to a lack of investigation and analysis of what can be expected once hillary clinton actually takes office
the corporate media has exploited the general populations distaste for sexism and white supremacy in the process trump has made heinous statement after heinous statement all of which should be taken seriously by anyone who calls themselves a movement activist it is critical that the left in the us extend solidarity to those who experience the consequences of racism and sexism every day however trumps vile character has been used as a means to legitimize the candidacy of hillary clinton his characterization as a fascist has convinced many that his rule would be a greater danger to humanity than a clinton presidency
one could endlessly debate clinton supporters on the validity of such a claim trumps vulgar and putrid presentation has provided clinton supporters with a convenient weapon of defense against all criticism of their own vile choice yet the lesser evil argument has never been weaker than in the  elections it is reasonable to assume that a hillary clinton presidency will be far less effective than obama in effecting capitalist and imperialist hegemony this is why her support system the entire ruling class has gone into overdrive to spread fear of a russiatrump collaborative threat in every sphere of us political life
here are ten things to expect from a clinton presidency i will leave it to readers to judge as to whether clinton represents a lesser evil than trump or just plain evil
 the privatization of social security  hillary clinton has stated publicly and privately to her wall street friends that she will reignite conversations to downsize the program wikileaks exposed clintons support for the obamas administrations deficit reduction commission that originally proposed cuts to entitlements such as social security and medicare in  clinton donors on wall street have made it clear that they would love to get a hold of social security earnings and turn them into a financial market to be traded for profit
more hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital voting for the lesser evil john pilger clinton policies will bring great aggression to the us and the world  world war iii  hillary clinton has stated in nearly every debate that her administration would consider placing a nofly zone in syria that means us airstrikes would rain down on syrian and russian assets in syria such a move would place the us military in direct confrontation with the russia clinton has been caught stating that the syrian and russian lives that will die in such a conflict are well worth the benefits
 the transpacific partnership  often called nafta on steroids the massive corporate trade agreement that captures much of asia pacific region has been a major talking point in the  elections clinton has supported the agreement in the past only to switch her position due to pressure from the bernie sanders campaign with sanders firmly in the clinton camp there is currently nothing in the way to stop clinton from moving forward with the tpps passage and making her private position on the deal a public reality
 maintenance and expansion of the surveillance state  not much needs to be said here the obama administrations vast expansion of the surveillance state has been exposed by the likes of ed snowden and julian assange wikileaks additionally revealed clintons desire to drone julian assange for releasing washingtons secrets to the public a clinton presidency has every intention of following up on the obama administrations passage of bills such as the national defense authorization act of  this bill gave the us government the right to militarily detain terror suspects indefinitely
 trumps wall  hillary clinton was obamas secretary of state from  over this time she helped facilitate the largest deportation of undocumented people in us history furthermore she oversaw the detention of thousands of central american children during the great migration from the  fascist coup in honduras a coup that was drawn up by clinton herself the usmexico border is more militarized than it has ever been trumps wall rhetoric was indeed a racist trip but too few recognize that something just as dangerous actually exists under current us immigration policy
 servitude to the bankers  hillary clinton has received over forty million in support from hedge funds in the  elections before selling out bernie sanders made it a point to request public access into clintons private quarter million dollar speeches to banks like goldman sachs the deregulation of the banks with the passage of the glasssteagall act was a clinton project both her current list of donors and past connection to her husbands policies make her the obvious choice for the finance capitalist class
 maintenance of the mass black incarceration state  hillary clinton is the enemy of black america from her callous use of the term super predator to describe working class black men to being the architect of the  crime bill the clinton dynasty virtually built the mass black incarceration state under bill and hillary clintons two terms the prison population rose by  this was facilitated by draconian three strikes laws mandatory drug sentence and the deep militarization of local police departments with her record it isnt too difficult to assume what another four years of clinton rule will bring in the realm of policing and prisons
 austerity and more austerity  it was the first clinton administration that eliminated welfare as we know it the evisceration of aid to families and dependent children afdc and its replacement temporary assistance to needy families tanf threw millions of women and children into poverty obama has followed up with draconian cuts to snap foodstamps there is nothing on clintons track record that indicates her administration would do anything but roll back whatever social programs and protections still exist for the poor in the us
 a boost to the privatization of education  hillary clinton received boos in july when she urged teachers unions and charter operators to work together for the greater good of students ever since clinton has attempted to exploit the rise of sanders by courting teachers unions to endorse her her position has slightly softened on the privatization of education but that hardly matters clinton receives broad support from school privatizers like walmart and should not be expected to roll back the shock and awe war on public education waged by the obama administration
 an economic crisis  bankers and economists have been predicting an economic crash for much of  capitalists everywhere were given free rein to recover with trillions in stimulus cash after sending the entire global capitalist economy into collapse in  the internal contradictions of the system are only sharpening as workers become poorer and global production stagnates whether clinton can manage a crisis in service of the capitalists as well obama has remains to be seen
clinton may very well be the highest expression of ruling class consensus that has ever presented itself in an election season her political record represents a greater material threat to humanity than donald trump for the sheer fact that she is the preferred candidate of the ruling class the question now is whether mass sentiment exists to organize around an alternative to the twoparty corporate duopoly jill stein and ajamu baraka are attempting to build the base of the green party ticket whatever method is chosen it must be wielded to combat lesser evil politics and build an organized force ready to struggle against the intensified suffering that will surely be imposed on the world by a clinton administration",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,2.2264292892673696,8,2,8398,1366,5.122254758418741,1366.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,1.4337674415068775,1.363497107800207,0.0326986944705765,1.4069725544415888,0.0043923865300146,0.0,0.0007320644216691,0,4,0.0,0.0097207658886379,-0.994,0.086,0.115,0.799,Negative,Very Strong

Paul Kengor,tom hayden from sds and viet cong to progressives for obama,"search the left in power  clinton to obama david horowitz explains how the democrats became a leftwing party in volume vii of the black book of the american left october   richard baehr 
below is richard baehrs review of david horowitzs new book the left in power clinton to obama reprinted from american thinker with permission the book is volume  of the black book of the american left  a multivolume collection of david horowitzs conservative writings that will when completed be the most ambitious effort ever undertaken to define the left and its agenda order here  we encourage our readers to visit blackbookoftheamericanleftcom which features horowitzs introductions to volumes  of this volume series along with their tables of contents reviews and interviews with the author 
every year there is some report of the blissful ignorance of american history demonstrated by the supposedly best and brightest at elite american universities suffice it to say the collected writings of david horowitz on the american left which constitute part of a solid foundation for understanding the last half century of american politics are nowhere to be found on any college or high school reading list 
horowitzs latest book the left in power clinton to obama  is the seventh volume in his ninevolume collection the black book of the american left  this new volume provides a collection of his writings over the last quarter century focusing primarily on the lefts control in our government and culture as horowitz reveals even during the bush years conservatives were on the defense and leftists controlled the narrative as they attempted to destroy bush and his chances for reelection in  their primary mode of attack was to undermine americas efforts in iraq almost from the start of the conflict when just months earlier a majority of senate democrats and near half of house democrats had supported the president the left then destroyed bushs second term with bogus charges of racist neglect in the handling of hurricane katrina there was plenty of incompetence in the response to katrina but local and state officials  all democrats of course and many of them african american  were the principal operators on the ground during the crisis 
the immediate abandonment of support for the iraq war effort was a signal event in american history sending a message that a large part of the democratic party was not remotely concerned about the morale of our men and women fighting overseas the weak effort by some democrats to hold onto an ounce of patriotic resolve  end the war support the troops  was designed more for campaign speeches than any meaningful attempt to convey national unity for the effort underway by our armed forces so too the obsession with abu ghraib gave the lie to the democrats support our troops message as a broad brush was used to paint the incident as somehow what you would expect from our military on a routine basis 
horowitz outlines this narrative faulting the bush administration for failing to fight harder to present its story of why we went into iraq and the risks if we had done nothing regrettably the bush administration never had a chance to get a better defense of the iraq war out to the media most in the media considered the bush administration illegitimate due to its narrow victory in the  presidential contest a lie to be sure  unfortunately it is almost certainly true that the media today are far more in the bag for the left than ten or twenty years ago and work harder at pushing the lefts agenda the soft liberalism of walter cronkite has been replaced by cable and national network anchors who routinely bury stories embarrassing to their side and focus on those that can do damage to the other side during the current presidential election cycle we have seen the most prestigious media organs explain why it is necessary and appropriate for them to be biased this year it is a special time they argue because trump is in their view a unique threat to the republic 
on the other hand the media have been loath to consider the damage to the country caused by barack obama  the loss of respect abroad for americas will to fight the degradation of our military readiness the fraying of ties with allies and the near obsessive outreach to americas enemies that led to agreements such as the nuclear deal with iran best described as an abject surrender of american interests that will lead to the funding of fanatical nuclear regime about  of those supposedly sensible proisrael democrats walked the plank behind their great leader on that deal with no visible regrets to date there was simply too much political risk to oppose the first black president of their party the media were happy to parrot the administrations talking points for the nuclear deal something the manipulators crowed over at the white house 
at least in the propaganda use of abu ghraib the left was honest in revealing what it thinks about the military as horowitz outlines in article after article the left is fighting a war that most americans do not see disguising its intentions through its aggressive unceasing promotion of progressive policies to make america a better place this commitment to deception emerges horowitz reveals from the allegiance to the ideology of saul alinskys rules for radicals a formative doctrine for both barack obama and hillary clinton the progressive goal is to achieve a new society that has never been seen before in this country though it has been promised and has catastrophically failed in many places around the globe in america the left is not only unconcerned with selling their program to the public but also horowitz argues it is fearful of the result of voters knowing what it is pursuing one prime example was the admission of mit professor and obamacare architect jonathan gruber that health care law would never have made it through congress if it had been presented honestly 
the left is also busy at work making it easier for itself to win politically horowitz provides chapter and verse on the lefts efforts to rapidly change the composition of the voting pool  motor voter registration with no birth certificate required fighting every effort to combat voter fraud with charges of racism and turning the clock back even when states were willing to pay for potential voters obtaining the needed documents to register support for open borders expansion of legal immigration and amnesty and citizenship and voting rights for more than ten million already in the country illegally here the lefts mentor and financier is george soros and his buddies who have funded dozens of organizations which fight on multiple fronts every day to advance the left politically and horowitz has done a great public service by his discover the network listing of the people responsible for americas steady drift to the radical left 
the left uses the racism charge in many of the confrontations it creates of course the problems of americas inner cities all under complete control of one political party for half a century have never been of even near equal interest to the democrats as their ability to continue to win enormous majorities among inner city voters particularly african americans the left has fully endorsed the teacher unions opposition to charter schools and voucher programs though both are popular with minority group parents and children the two major teachers unions are simply too powerful a support group for the democratic party campaign cash votes and volunteers for the left to support policies that might lead to a better future for kids as opposed to continued growth in expenditures for the teachers unions and their workforce 
in the last two years the sorosfunded black lives matter movement has created a near national hysteria over the alleged systematic effort by police to kill unarmed black men between two and three dozen unarmed blacks are killed by cops each year many of them in situations where the victims were almost certainly responsible for what happened to them  michael brown in ferguson is a prime example one wonders where the news media are to report on the police shooting of unarmed whites which greatly outnumber those of unarmed blacks perhaps because there are no riots or looting these incidents have no cachet more likely they do not fit the systemic racism charge now routinely thrown around by everyone from the current president to hillary clinton 
in chicago in  months this year over  blacks mostly men have been shot and killed almost exclusively by other black men by year end over  chicagoans will have been shot one might think this was a bigger story of urban calamity and civil society breakdown than a shooting in charlotte chicagos mayor says that police have gone fetal avoiding making stops in crime ridden neighborhoods with the aclu looking over their shoulder demanding a report for every stop and activists in the neighborhoods treating the police with scorn and abuse following a bad police shooting captured on video and kept hidden from the public by chicagos mayor to protect his reelection bid rahm emanuel must also have read alinsky for he knows whose hide to protect first and foremost the victims of the police pullback in chicago baltimore st louis and other cities called the ferguson effect are many more dead black men killed in crime waves that are reminiscent of the s even the fbi director admits the ferguson effect is real when not covering for hillary clinton 
horowitz latest book is full of insights and straight talk on the goals and the mission of the left and how it has advanced its cause this last quarter century he provides the kind of arguments that keep his books from getting reviewed by the new york times and there is always a horrible slur available from the left to describe a viewpoint that counters one of its missions the left chooses to ignore the argument and uses character assassination for the people making it it argues that these are people horowitz included unworthy of serious consideration or respect 
silencing the critic or the dissident or limiting his visibility has been a long time weapon of the left so far horowitz keeps writing and america is free enough that the left though it clearly wants to cannot ban his books george soros and his family have another  billion to spend on changing america the alinsky acolytes have their mission laid out to make use of the funds and create an america where the smart bureaucrats can organize society and distribute its wealth so results are all equal and we can all sing along with the pete seeger songs as we turn away from any role overseas where of course we have primarily been an agent of evil and disinvest in defense every year

was not quite as cheerful as she had been just minutes ago the october afternoon was cooling off as evening approached and jonathan could see his breath the coach trundled past wellmaintained stone gables and a heavy wroughtiron gate standing open on one side oil lanterns hung from black hooks in the gables glowed dimly in the fog and additional lanterns spilled pools of yelloworange light on a cobblestone drive as they made their way up toward the house eleanor gasped as the massive shape of the house came into view its beautiful jonathan made a surprised hm but otherwise said nothing a welldressed footman dashed out to lower the stairs of their coach and open the door then offered a whitegloved hand to eleanor as she peered out with a flashed smile at jonathan she accepted the young mans hand and descended the driver was speaking quietly with another footman and an older man emerged from the heavy oak door of the house as jonathan descended the steps of the coach the older man  clearly the butler  bowed to eleanor and jonathan welcome to the anne union keyes estate i am mister walker and i am at your service the master of the estate has invited you in for the evening meal

hesitation she must have decided they were staying for dinner for with a delighted squeal she headed for the house they were greeted in the foyer by an elderly man jonathan estimated he was in his seventies hair fully white with deep creases in his face on age showing on his hands however the man was tall and straightbacked and he carried himself proudly there was a stiffness to his movements and he used a cane to walk but when jonathan shook his large hands the mans grip was as firm as a man half his age welcome he said warmly and with what jonathan thought was a german accent i am gottfried hansjürgen von graeff please be welcome in my home how may i call you the mans eyes were unusual but jonathan could not place what it was about them that seemed so he shrugged it off thank

among the many wikileaks emails that were dumped this summer it was clear that hillary clinton is not as popular as the media would have you believe in fact it became clear that she has no real support in a hacked email to the point where she was forced to pay young voters to stump online for her 
the gateway pundit reported  
shes the astroturfed candidate hillary is sooo unpopular that she has to pay off young voters to support her and show up at her rallies 
 biggest scoops from the dncleaks wikileak 
wikileaks released nearly  hacked emails it says are from the accounts of democratic national committee officials on friday 
the emails are devastating for hillary clinton according to at least one hacked email hillary clinton has no real support and must pay youth voters to defend her online she also pays millennials to show up at her rallies 
hillarys support is all a lie its all astroturfed everything this woman does is all a lie  even her rallies are fabricated 
if attkissons explanation were not enough how about this tweet regarding the mainstream media putting their collective useful idiot heads together to pitch the same propaganda about donald trump  biggest scoops from the dncleaks httpstcovmtiepspkj 
 mike cernovich  cernovich july   
this should have come as no surprise 
if you remember when her campaign kicked off in  i reported on the fact that more than  of her twitter followers were either completely fake or inactive  
additionally when she had her iowa kickoff event a whopping  people showed up  the majority of those were reporters 
hillary clinton only has the backing of the media and rabid antiamerican liberals and even then it looks like shes having to pay them to actually do anything to support her in other words her candidacy is completely contrived

fifteenyearold taylor hutton has known that hes gay for as long as he can remember and over the past few months hes been working up the courage to finally tell his friends and family the truth taylor even planned to film some of those moments and post them on youtube in hopes that they might help other kids going through a similar experience but just when this teen was ready to stop hiding who he really is something incredible happened donald trump and mike pence were elected into the white house and taylor just got another four years to plan his viral comingout video 
um luckiest teen ever

instead of releasing some halfbaked hastily edited video on his youtube channel this spring taylor will now get to spend at least the next four years of a trumppence administration dreaming up the most heartwarming and totally shareable comingout video imaginable and depending on how the next election goes this kid just might get the chance to keep brainstorming camera angles and staging options in his head until hes well into his mids or older 
so awesome with cameras only getting better and better its possible that four years from now well even get to witness taylor finally arrive at some sort of peace with himself in stunning crystalclear k resolution

Jason Easley,early voting is so strong for democrats that clinton could lock up nevada this week,"politics us senator bernie sanders 
former us democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders has threatened presidentelect donald trump warning that his camp will be trumps worst nightmare if he goes after minorities in america 
if donald trump takes peoples anger and turns it against muslims hispanics african americans and women we will be his worst nightmare the vermont senator wrote on his twitter page on thursday 
the yearold senator had earlier issued a statement after the new york businessmans victory in the us election on november  promising to work with him on certain issues but also to oppose him should he pursue divisive and discriminatory policies 
to the degree that mr trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country i and other progressives are prepared to work with him sanders said 
to the degree that he pursues racist sexist xenophobic and antienvironment policies we will vigorously oppose him he added 
during the primaries sanders ran a close race with clinton and promised to continue the fight all the way until the democratic national convention in june where the partys nominee was going to be named 
towards the end of the race however sanders changed his tone and bowed out in favor of clinton he also appeared next to her during the dnc and supported his party opponent in the democratic campaigns 
on july   sanders formally endorsed clinton after facing mounting pressure from major democratic figures including outgoing us president barack obama himself us republican presidentelect donald trump delivers his acceptance speech during his election night event at the new york hilton midtown in the early morning hours of november   in new york city photo by afp 
on tuesday trump stunned the world by defeating heavily favored clinton in the presidential election sending the united states on a new uncertain path 
trump rode a wave of anger toward the elite us establishment to win the white house race against clinton a longtime washington insider 
the new york businessman garnered  electoral votes in the  us election while his rival and the former secretary of state received  votes despite winning the popular vote 
thousands of people since then have rallied in cities across the us to protest against trumps presidential election victory condemning his controversial campaign rhetoric against muslims immigrants women and other groups 
this is while trump said in his victory speech he would be president for all americans it is time for us to come together as one united people he said 
the real estate moguls election campaign had been marred by his disparaging remarks against minorities in the us his comments include a call to ban all muslims from coming to america as well as stopping mexican migrants by building a long wall along the usmexico border 
he has also sought for a database to track muslims across the united states and said that the us would have absolutely no choice but to close down mosques

Daniel Greenfield,obama votes against us at un,"an eyebrowraising new study from a nonpartisan research institute october   matthew vadum 
the obama administration is using billions of dollars in banking fines to fund radical leftwing activist groups that work to elect democrats according to an eyeopening new study from a nonpartisan research institute 
during eric holders term as attorney general from february  through april  a little under  billion was paid by us banks under the threat of federal lawsuits all but  million of that sum came from three big settlements bank of america citigroup and jp morgan chase 
many of the cases rest on bogus disparate impact theory which leftwing government lawyers use to make sure that banks become liable for charges of racism based upon the perceived injustice of lending disparity in certain lower income areas regardless of the reasons for the disparity 
instead of being used to help the supposed victims of these banks the money flows to leftist allies of president obama 
adding insult to injury the process by which the money snakes its way to leftwing organizations is both corrupt and unconstitutional according to the report from the government accountability institute that is called follow the money how the department of justice funds progressive activists bestselling clinton cash author and anticorruption crusader peter schweizer is gais president the full page report is available in pdf form here  
the report states 
the department of justice has curated an opaque system wherein appointed attorneys can legally extract money from the private sector and redistribute the funds to thirdparty organizations outside of the appropriations processan unprecedented and extraordinary disregard for congressional authority 
it adds these funds directed by the doj effectively replaced funding to activist nonprofits previously denied by congress 
much of the cash moves through neighborworks the nonprofit gave more than  million to the rabblerousing group neighborhood assistance corp of america naca whose leader bruce marks calls himself a bank terrorist it also gave over  million to asian americans for equality aafe an organization with communist roots and continued close ties to a very vocal north korean sympathizer 
the illgotten funds extorted from the banks also trickle down to leftwing groups such as national council of la raza nhs of chicago national urban league and operation hope 
many of the nonprofits that receive such funding spend the money to elect democrats 
catalist a george sorosfunded forprofit data analytics company specializing in leftprogressive causes along with a group called nonprofit vote mobilize these federally funded nonprofits  to get the vote out for those who tend to be reliably progressive the report states 
catalist was founded by former bill clinton aide harold ickes in  following democrats electoral wipeout in  leftwing activists believed republicans owed george w bushs reelection victory to heavy spending on voter contact technology including databases 
according to a capital research center report  
catalist boasts it was vital to president obamas  victory by its own admission over  organizations campaigns and committees used the companys services based on data that was loaded into the catalist databases and then standardized a catalist analysis of the  cycle says progressive organizations the obama campaign and federal party committees attempted to contact more than  million people this means that the progressive community attempted to contact over  of the us adult population contacts were delivered inperson over the phone by mail and over the internet 
of course leeching off others is generally how the activist left funds itself apart from oceans of cash supplied by leftwing fatcat megadonors like george soros and michael bloomberg and a galaxy of radical foundations the left derives its sustenance by ripping off taxpayers at the federal state and local levels 
the report states the evidence shows the left is using the department of justice and the power of the federal government to extract money from financial institutions for redistribution to progressive activists whose real intent is far more partisan than the housing and housing education for which they ostensibly exist 
in other words the left plays by a different set of rules than the rest of america there is no level socalled playing field in american electoral politics in a sense the system is rigged there is the parasitic left feeding at the taxpayer trough versus everybody else 
conservatives knew about this travesty already but few studies have been put together that follow the money trail for a half century the left has been using taxpayer dollars to fund efforts to advance radical subversive causes in the united states 
changes in federal social policy in the mids helped lay the groundwork for this insidious leftist astroturfing under the profoundly antisocial war on poverty the federal government has been handing out taxpayer money since  to liberal and radical socalled community organizations to help them agitate against the status quo one could say america declared war on itself and conscripted saul alinskyinspired pressure groups to do the fighting in recent decades those on the left  including groups like acorn and moneygrubbing con artists like jesse jackson sr  have also become quite adept at working outside the public sector to shake down banks and other businesses to fill their war chests 
conservative groups receive no such largesse from uncle sam and in fairness many such organizations would likely reject government funding on principle if offered it 
this sueandsettle corruption will undoubtedly continue if hillary clinton becomes president secretary of labor tom perez  no stranger to the shakedown business himself is said to be a top contender for the attorney general post in any new clinton administration perez who previously ran the dojs civil rights division is also a past president of casa de maryland a notorious advocacy group for illegal aliens funded by george soros and the late venezuelan strongman hugo chavez 
the moneyraising scam described in the gai report isnt the only way leftwing groups fill up their bank accounts 
activist groups were encouraged to agitate by the carterera community reinvestment act which enshrined in law a kind of lending protection racket banking regulators who had come under the influence of groups like acorn had the power to make trouble for banks that failed to lend enough money to borrowers in socalled underserved communities banks that paid enough  whatever that means  got left alone but banks that didnt got their legs broken 
few serious economists doubt that the mortgage market debacle and the economic collapse of  were caused by the deliberate weakening of underwriting standards carried out in the name of ending discrimination 
leftists played both sides they called banks racist and demanded more subprime lending for minorities and then when the loans went bad called the banks racist for supposedly targeting minority borrowers it was and is pure gangsterism through the magic of dysphemism the once sought after subprime lending was transformed into predatory lending 
the shaking down of lenders intensified when thentreasury secretary robert rubin presided over the clinton administrations effort to put the cra on steroids banks began to make risky subprime loans and fannie mae and freddie mac aggregated them for sale in the secondary market as mortgagebacked securities these practices made it easier for banks to give in to the demands of acorn and other groups to originate more and more doomed mortgages because they knew they could offload their highrisk debt on quasigovernmental suckers fannie and freddie which were under intense political pressure to service the subprime market 
president clinton turned the community reinvestment act a onceobscure and lightly enforced banking regulation law into one of the most powerful mandates shaping american citiesand as senate banking committee chairman phil gramm memorably put it a vast extortion scheme against the nations banks howard husock of the manhattan institute wrote in city journal  
when husock wrote in  us banks had committed nearly  trillion for innercity and lowincome mortgages and real estate development projects most of it funneled through a nationwide network of leftwing community groups intent in some cases on teaching their lowincome clients that the financial system is their enemy and implicitly that government rather than their own striving is the key to their wellbeing 
enterprising leftwing levelers never tire of dreaming up these redistribution schemes

Daniel Greenfield,nigerian novelist wonders why everyone loves hillary,"obamas weighs options for his final stab at israel in his twilight months in office obama seeks to undermine americas closest ally november   ari lieberman 
israelis and the proisrael community at large will breathe a collective sigh of relief when obama leaves office during obamas tenure relations with israel were caustic at best barely five months after taking office he publicly launched a scathing attack against israel  where he perversely insinuated a moral equivalence between israeli and palestinian actions  and did so in one of the most virulently antisemitic countries on the planet he later skipped over israel despite the fact that israel was a mere minute plane ride away that was obamas opening salvo against americas closest ally it was only downhill from there 
obama utilized highlevel administration sources to leak negative information about israel to sympathetic members of the press in one such instance an administration official probably ben rhodes  referred to prime minister benjamin netanyahu as a  chickensht  in another instance obama voiced concurrence with french president nicholas sarkozy when sarkozy characterized netanyahu as a  liar  
often the obama administration would subject israeli dignitaries to humiliating treatment during official state visits israels defense minister moshe yaalon was shamefully transformed into a persona non grata in the most notorious incident obama left netanyahu out in the cold while having dinner with michelle and his daughters one commentator dryly noted that obama treated netanyahu as though he was the president of equatorial guinea 
ultimately obama crossed the line and received significant pushback from democratic lawmakers and donors obama got the message and toned down the rhetoric but his deepseeded animus against israel never dissipated and relations with israels prime minister remained toxic 
tensions surfaced again during israels counter insurgency campaign against the gazabased terror group hamas obama held up a shipment of hellfire missiles to israel and then tried to strongarm israel into accepting a suicidal ceasefire agreement brokered by turkey and qatar two despotic nations that support hamas and gave aid and comfort to islamic state terrorists 
obama saw netanyahus opposition to the jcpoa the socalled iran deal as a personal attack and allowed his petulant nature to further sour relations the socalled settlements were another point of contention obama disregarded a letter of assurance to israel provided by the bush administration specifying that in light of new realities on the ground including already existing major israeli populations centers it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of  
bush gave implicit recognition to existing settlement blocs and the right of israel to build within those blocs it is also important to note that no new settlement was created during obamas term of office and netanyahu had even agreed to an unprecedented month moratorium on construction within the disputed territories but nothing was ever enough for obama who never wasted an opportunity to excoriate israel at every turn his parting shot was at the united nations general assembly during a recent address to that contemptible body he explicitly singled out israel for criticism but heaped praise on the xenophobic nation of indonesia obamas moral compass had gone completely awry 
despite the fact that obama is in his twilight months he can still inflict immeasurable harm on israel according to a report featured in the wall street journal  obama is contemplating several options each with significant negative implications for israel the report noted that he will only implement those options during the transitional period after november  so as not to harm clintons presidential prospects 
he may seek to remove tax exempt status for organizations supportive of israeli communities living in east jerusalem judea and samaria perhaps more ominously he may seek to impose dictates on israel utilizing the un security council 
in one such scenario obama may seek to pass a resolution condemning settlement construction and declaring israeli communities situated in judea and samaria to be illegal alternatively the administration may seek formal recognition of the state of palestine even though such a state has no formal boundaries and rejects israels existence as a jewish state lastly he is said to be considering the possibility of setting up the parameters of a future peace agreement that would entail significant israeli territorial concessions 
the united states does not have to actively support any unsc resolution to see the successful passage of antiisraeli measures it merely has to fail to exercise its veto powers france facing significant problems of its own in connection with its growing radicalized muslim population has historically been the fiercest advocate for the palestinian arabs it is likely that the administration would seek to have the french submit a draft resolution and the united states would simply abstain while the permanent and nonpermanent members voted thus guaranteeing passage 
israel has few friends on the security council and american collusion with a body that could arguably be considered todays greatest purveyors of antisemitism would be an act of extreme betrayal it would also represent bad policy and would significantly complicate efforts to broker a future peace agreement 
but israel is not without recourse there is strong bipartisan support for israel in congress and lawmakers from both sides of the political divide have already expressed to the white house their strong opposition to un involvement 
some like the jerusalem posts caroline glick have suggested that the israelis can reach out to the russians with carrots in an effort to counter obamas nefarious plans but this option seems to be a stretch moscow has always been in the pockets of the muslim bloc and its recent vote at unesco in support of a resolution denying the jewish nexus to jerusalem serves to reinforce this view moreover even if russia can be persuaded relying on putin for favors is akin to borrowing money from the mafia and would come with a steep price 
it is ironic that with the multitude of problems currently facing the administration  spiraling healthcare costs racial discord cyber breaches russias seizure of crimea and eastern ukraine isis the meltdown in the arab world iranian terrorism chinas expansion into the south and east china seas the migrant crisis immigration reform  obama would choose to focus his negative energies on harming the mideasts only democracy and americas staunchest ally that fact in it of itself speaks volumes about the man",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,52,7,6802,1065,5.3605633802816905,1065.0,-0.3045033525141309,-0.5778293249656962,1.0115110569556518,0.8916251899910035,0.2678859331674119,0.9240684562964986,0.0018779342723004,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0037437024060025,-0.9565,0.114,0.121,0.766,Negative,Very Strong

lets load  million in unmarked foreign currency on an unmarked cargo plane and deliver it to iran then make follow that up with a few more and make sure iran scores  billion in sanctions relief 
thats how we got here  its smartpower which is neither smart nor powerful 
earlier this month us navy ships had to fire defensive interceptor missiles after they were targeted by attacks launched from houthicontrolled yemen 
this was likely the first time in history the navy had to take such measures and officials are now saying they think iran is behind the attacks 
we believe that iran is connected to this vice admiral kevin donegan told nbc news in fact the us has intercepted many shipments of weapons from iran to the houthi militants who oppose yemens internationally recognized government in a conflict that has seen thousands of civilian deaths and mass starvation of the civilian population 
the intercepted shipments were filled with coastal defense cruise missiles boats that we believe were explosive boats other weapons that were clearly on the decks of their ships that we saw donegan said 
im sure theres no chance that the billions obama lavished on iranian jihadists have in any way freed up the terror state to open its own jihadi candy store not a chance

Twain Yobra,fight inflammation with these  vitamins and minerals and where to get them," pm again donald trump was not opposed to the war in iraq   
ever since donald trump was lambasted by leaders in both parties for fighting with a gold star family and dishonoring the service of captain humayun khan hes been trying out a new approach pretending khan would still be alive if he was president 
khan was killed in  in a suicide attack in iraq 
when the republican was asked in an interview with abcs george stephanopoulos if he thinks he should apologize for the way he treated the khan family following the democratic national convention he repeated this bogus claim

trump said i have great respect for the khan family i have great respect for  i mean their son is a great hero  but if i were president at that time capt khan would be alive today george because i wouldnt have been in iraq  i was opposed to the war in iraq 
as hillary clinton and many objective sources have noted repeatedly throughout the campaign donald trump was not opposed to the war in iraq from the beginning had he been president at the time the war still would have taken place because trump was in favor of it 
in fact trumps campaign rhetoric today indicates that he would be a president who acts recklessly and would only embolden our enemies this would make the world a more dangerous place and only increase the odds that america gets mired in more conflicts not less 
for their part the clinton campaign has continued to stand up to trumps attacks on the khan family in an emotional new ad released days ago capt khans father recounts how his son died protecting everyone in his unit khans father asked of trump would my son have a place in your america 
the answer to mr khans question is a resounding no as trump has promised to ban muslims  like the khans  from even entering the united states for those living here already a president trump would treat them like criminals

Isabelle Z.,beware you could be poisoning yourself by reheating these five foods,"mutiny at the fbi comey warned by his own agents to indict clinton or watch the fbis reputation go down in flames 
monday october   tags james comey  fbi mutiny  clinton investigation naturalnews as america inches toward open revolt over the runaway criminality and collusion of the democrats and the media  another kind of revolt is taking place inside the fbi according to multiple sources in the independent media  now the only remaining free press in america  fbi director james comey was forced into announcing a reopening of the criminal investigation into hillary clintons private email server by livid fbi agents who threatened to go public if comey didnt actjames comey long since suspected to be a clinton operative who deliberately allowed hillary clinton to get away with a vast number of felony crimes and national security violations now finds himself with his back against the wall if he releases the evidence against hillary clinton already possessed by the fbi he will face the wrath of obama the clintons the corrupt loretta lynch doj and the entire leftist media if he once again gives hillary clinton a free pass on her numerous crimes he then faces a mutiny inside the fbi which promises to bypass his authority and leak the criminal evidence directly to the alternative media fbi agents under comey are desperately trying to save their agency from going down in flames agents inside the fbi in other words refuse to allow james comey to let the agency go down in flames as just another corrupt branch of the clinton crime family via the daily mail uk  james comeys decision to revive the investigation of hillary clintons email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi  including some of his top deputies according to a source close to the embattled fbi director this dovetails with my own sources who tell me that the recent acquittal of the oregon ranchers has also driven a stake through james comeys reputation as he is the fbi official who reportedly ordered the execution of robert lavoy finicum whose suspected execution by fbi agents was caught on tape because the oregon ranchers have now been acquitted by a jury it means fbi head james comey seems to have ordered the shooting and killing of an innocent man under comey  and to the dismay of the many great agents working inside the fbi  comey may have turned the agency toward a lawless armed tyranny that guns down innocent americans while letting corrupt criminal politicians go free for many fbi agents who have spent their entire careers serving the fbi as honest dedicated federal agents the thought of allowing james comey to singlehandedly commit political arson and burn down the fbis hardwon reputation is just too much to bearresignations are beginning to pile up on comeys desk as livid fbi agents head for the exitsvia the daily mail the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades comey told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom and while the decision to reopen the case may appease fbi agents and republicans in the shortterm we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence as such we continue to question just how long comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post adds zero hedge  at a bare minimum in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation we fail to understand how an independent investigation into hillarys email server isnt warranted james comey is an arsonist and hes going to burn the fbi to the ground unless his agents mutiny the upshot of all this is that james comey is an arsonist if his own agents dont force him to apply the law to the clinton investigations comey will burn the agency to the ground leaving its reputation in ashes and that sadly will make the world a very dangerous place for all the fbi agents in the field because everyday americans would begin to see them all as corrupt lawless tyrants working as part of a criminal regime in washington that refuses to apply laws to its own kindthe truth is that most fbi agents are hard working professional men and women who are desperately trying to shut down the operations of terrorists financial fraudsters kidnappers murderers and other dangerous criminals yet if james comey doesnt defend the fbis reputation by indicting hillary clinton  he will likely be placing fbi field agents in grave danger as they face the wrath of citizens who begin to see them all as part of a corrupt criminal tyranny run by the political mafia in dccomey in other words is more dangerous to the entire fbi than any other single person in washington right now if he doesnt find his moral compass and guide the fbi through this crisis with law and order intact hes going to go down in history and in flames as the man who forever destroyed the credibility of the fbi and likely turned his field agents into ready targets for an enraged populaceno doubt hell get an extra bonus from loretta lynch if he once again decides to nullify the rule of law in america and announce that hillary wont be subject to the same laws that would immediately ensnare anyone else remember if comey gives hillary clinton a free pass he demonstrates to all americans that lawlessness is now the accepted standard of conduct in washington  and if our political leaders will not be held to account for their crimes then practically speaking why should any citizen feel compelled to follow any federal laws at all james comey if you want to salvage the fbis reputation announce a recommendation for the indictment of both hillary clinton and loretta lynch if theres one thing abundantly clear in all this its that both hillary clinton and loretta lynch should be behind bars  clinton is a lifelong criminal and mafia boss lynch is a thirdrate attorney who was tossed into the doj solely because of her gender and skin color not her credentials and neither one respects the laws of america of course both are deeply corruptif the fbi hopes to have any reputation remaining after the hillary clinton campaign implodes either before or on november th comey needs to come out strong right now and lay out the evidence that unambiguously shows hillary clinton had clear intent to violate national security laws  among other serious crimesall comey would have to say is something like in the view of the fbi hillary clinton is clearly not qualified to serve as commander in chief and we recommend she be indicted for violations of national security and so on with a single sentence comey could reinvigorate the fbi and position himself as an historic american heroright now id imagine the clinton machine is mailing bloody body parts in tiny wooden coffins to james comeys home address along with notes that say something like youre next lets watch and see if he grows a spine and refuses to be

when breitbart news washington political editor matthew boyle confronted mook about creamer and his firm in the spin room after the third presidential debate mook claimed theyve never worked for our campaign when asked if clinton had ever discussed the controversial political operations with creamer directly mook replied i dont think so 
now however okeefe and project veritas have released video of creamer claiming that clinton directly approved one of his more bizarre plans  an effort to attract media attention and incite violence by dressing an activist in a donald duck costume and sending that activist into trump events emphasizing the argument that trump was ducking releasing his tax returns

Daniel Greenfield,wife of fbi official investigating hillary got k from hillary allied pac,"obamacare is great we just need to punish people for not using it october   
butbut i thought we were trying to help people 
obamacare visionary jonathan stupidity of the american voter gruber is back when last we heard from the man with the same name as the die hard villain he was being ushered off the scene after explaining how stupid everyone was  
an architect of the federal healthcare law said last year that a lack of transparency and the stupidity of the american voter helped congress approve obamacare in a clip unearthed sunday massachusetts institute of technology professor jonathan gruber appears on a panel and discusses how the reform earned enough votes to pass 
he suggested that many lawmakers and voters didnt know what was in the law or how its financing worked and that this helped it win approval lack of transparency is a huge political advantage gruber said and basically call it the stupidity of the american voter or whatever but basically that was really really critical for the thing to pass gruber made the comment while discussing how the law was written in a tortured way to avoid a bad score from the congressional budget office he suggested that voters would have rejected obamacare if the penalties for going without health insurance were interpreted as taxes either by budget analysts or the public if cbo scored the individual mandate as taxes the bill dies gruber said 
now the gruber is back and ready to explain why the only problem with obamacare is the lack of severe beatings  
there is no sense in which the law has to be fixed the law is working as designed however it could work better and i think probably the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty we have individuals who are essentially freeriding on the system theyre essentially waiting until they get sick and then getting health insurance the whole idea of this plan which was pioneered in massachusetts was that the individual mandate penalty would bring those people into the system and have them participate the penalty right now is probably too low and thats something i think ideally we would fix 
ideally we would penalize gruber and everyone involved in inflicting this monstrosity on the public but predictably grubers proposal is to offer up more beatings until morale improves while pretending that anyone who isnt on obamacare is just a free rider",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,72,12,2409,412,4.822815533980583,412.0,0.3069974343475224,0.3616742515005802,-0.150752287238292,-0.1320703659206573,-0.2628184538499452,-0.1235607001445106,0.0024271844660194,0.0,0.0024271844660194,0,0,0.0,0.0042979674087722,-0.9812,0.093,0.151,0.756,Negative,Very Strong

Al Bundy,no title,"american woman in bikini desecrates french catacombs for her female indiana jones brand american woman in bikini desecrates french catacombs for her female indiana jones brand 
andré is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   girls 
the paris catacombs are a place dear to my heart born in this very city i had a front row seat to see it turn into a giant museum every wealthy asshole wanting his own piece of the city of lights and paris being one of the most visited cities in the world  i could see year after year the streets taken over by luxury clothing shops and expensive venues the middle and lower classes have been pushed aside by rising living costs so that the rich globalists the bobos and a neverending trail of tourists could stroll around 
yet go twenty meters below the haussmanian hurdle and you will find something very different 
south of the seine the lands have been deeply dug to extract building stones most of the voids have been filled since but more than a hundred kilometres of mine galleries are still there exploring the place is officially forbidden which is a good thing as one can go there officiously provided one knows how to enter and not get lost in the labyrinth without bothering with swarms of tourists or wasting money in an overpriced bar 
officially prohibited actually more or less selfmanaged by a loose community of cataphiles  the catacombs are one of the most interesting places today in paris it allows for genuine explorations and friendly meetings while also teaching some masculine virtues to those who venture there seriously 
the underground network being fragile and the officials not enjoying when too many visitors tread on their jurisdiction the cataphiles have a complex relationship with exposing it on the one hand we like to show the place and share its atmosphere with passionate newcomers on the other we are afraid that too much exposition will attract too many visitors and stifle the officials relative toleration for unofficial activities 
well today other cataphiles wont chastise me for mentioning the topic in public for this has been already made recently by an attention whore of international scope alison teal a hawaiian  or  years old girl made a show of herself down there and sent ludicrous photos to the daily mail  so im here to teach you about protecting the planet yknow i love bringing surfboards in places without waves by the way im the feminine indiana jones especially with the help of a crew ill never give credit to follow me on instagram and yt 
here we are not talking about attention whoring lightly the daily mail photos already tell much a blond girl in a pink bikini carries a pink surfboard in a narrow underground network where there is by definition no waves to surf at all to take some photos of herself herself herself and a bit of the catacombs as they could be used as the setting of the latest of alisons adventures im not joking these adventures are literally hitler a trademark 
since she was at least  teal seems to have taken advantage from the nomadic lifestyle of her parents to make photos movies and promote herself heavily along the way with the help of her dad a wellconnected photographer and selfpromoter who claims to master yoga she got a bunch of awards and media promotion longhaired alison was thus handed a niche that allows her to travel the world take pictures of herself in various places and claim to be concerned about the environment 
her résumé shows a massive ego associated to minor lies the world was my school and playgroundi guess smaller places would be too small for her giant ego and this may explain why she suffered from claustrophobia under paris as we are to see below between namedroppings references to media awards and other big pictures of alison teal and alison teal we learn she was styled the female indiana jones by time magazine  and the oprah of adventure by the huffington post  really 
actually teal said to the huffpo she aspired to be the oprah of adventure in  before branding herself as the female indiana jones to the time a year later  not  then she said on twitter and on her résumé how they had referred to her as such not a big lie but a lie indeed by the way she also branded herself a tarzan child in the huffpo interview would someone who really grew up in the wild be so obsessed with linking herself to famous icons excerpt from the huffpo article  the same articles adds she is a selfdescribed tarzan child excerpt from the time article  named by time magazine or selfstyled and now on her résumé not only does she lie by misattributing to famous media outlets selfcharacterizing and lavishly flattering labels but she cant even put the right years while referring to said media pieces 
so selfstyled female indiana jones no less went through what seems to be a joint undertaking with the daily mail by descending into the paris catacombs with the symbols of her adventures namely a pink bikini and a surfboard the english tabloid released the photos video and testimony of indianajonesinabikinisurfingthecatacombs the  th of october days after a bunch of french outlets copied the mail content often translating it verbatim  
what struck me first are the stunning inaccuracies the tabloid published first the mail claims teal went  meters below the ground whereas the actual depth of the catacombs goes between  and  meters depending on where you are in the network cant indiana jane tell the difference between  and  meters 
second she also claimed to have lacked oxygen and witnessed the water level suddenly rising this is at best extremely unlikely the water levels can change from month to month and even from week to week but to my knowledge it never changes abruptly in seconds as for the oxygen issue i have witnessed some only two times at a big party when so many people were in the same room that there was not enough oxygen to light a cigarette and from claustrophobic newcomers who could not stand the place 
either she completely made up the sudden water change and oxygen issues in order to give her story a sensational aspect or more likely got a panic attack due to claustrophobia but preferred to twist it into a grandiose plot rather than acknowledging her own limitations the mail just ate that up and published without question they did not ask any actual cataphile for sure had they done so anyone with a decent experience of the catacombes could have told them what i just wrote above 
i also noticed from her quotes that she does not mention anyone from her crew gives no credit to the men who opened the manhole cover helped her go down the humid ladder showed her the way filmed her she would never have found the entrance if no one already in the know had accepted to be her guide neither could she lift manhole covers of more than a hundred kilograms with her thin armseven the round butt she likes to display couldnt do that the first photo displayed by the mail notice how she strategically displays some of her butt 
i could bet she did not have sex with any of the guys who enabled her display to happen as julius evola hinted she is likely the kind of woman to whom the possibilities of physical love are often not as interesting as the narcissistic cult of her body or as being seen with as many or as few clothes as possible evola revolt against the modern world  chap 
in this respect the only thing that makes teal special compared to all other lookatme twats is the adventurous label she tries to put on herself exploiting people and places to garner attention is definitely not special yet a lot of comments have noticed this behind the weird mix of glamour and pseudoadventure some are offended that she treaded on bones ie remnants of real past men in a pink bikini doing so is not only a proof of bad taste and selfaggrandizing maniait is also utterly disrespectful 
this is indeed a blatant example of pussy pass  imagine going to hawaii bringing a skateboard at a local cemetery and start skateboarding over the graves in a pink throng what do you expect would happen you would probably get beaten by locals and if the media gave you attention at all they would label you as a disturbed troll or something like that all this i think would be fair but when a selfimportant oprah jane of superadventure does the same the mainstream media reacts completely differently and celebrates her without the least hint of criticism 
though she treading and surfing on bones of actual past people is not very respectful for sure i think especially appalling the outlook teal seems to carry on the place the catacombs are just another background for alison adventures whole places some loaded with historical and spiritual significance are reduced to a set for the egotic show of another vapid character the entire world was her school or so she said meaning that the world is turned into a mixture of disneyland and hollywood studio where her picture can stroll around some weeks ago alison teal was busy showing herself near an erupting volcano notice another strategic partdisplay of her butt 
usual newcomers to the catacombs come there with a genuine interest in the place they come to find out sometimes drink and have an actual adventure they cannot help but feel some humility perhaps even awe when meeting with the bones of millions of nameless dead most if not all of them having lived before the nineteenth century and having been carried there so that paris could grow 
this is very different from using the place to play adventure treading on bones in a rather inappropriate outfit depending on a crew of real cataphiles but forgetting to give them the slightest credit and showing utter carelessness to the historical and spiritual significance of the place all so that alisons ego adventures show continues 
as you can see above a lot of the comments are negativeespecially those from cataphiles and teal has discreetly withdrawn the video of her trail from youtube putting it into private mode 
teals circus has at least one merit it symbolizes pretty well one of the worst aspects of the westernization of the world in the west there is no wilderness no sacredness no magic there are tons of potential places for tourism but ultimately all these places are losing their soul and turning into disneylands the catacombs are worth it because they are definitely not so and should never be 
fortunately there can be some immanent justice the wave of criticism under teals disrespectful show is well deserved more harshly a young libtard who thought she could hitchhike through middle east to prove muslims peaceful got raped and killed by the peaceful ones she theatrically claimed to care about the event shew or should have shown that the world is not a giant kindergarten for western strong and independent narcissists 
in a world of selfmarketing and selfcentred cunts everyone is too busy caring about ones image and about meaningless representations to truly care about a place or about family members 
truly respectable women are not the ones we spot the most easily and true cataphiles are often discreet as well your humble servant bathed there before teal pretended to surf the place but i would definitely not exhibit myself treading on bones in a pink thong",prisonplanet.com,Fake,english,20.8,3.528806933996037,8,2,11436,1983,4.741301059001513,1983.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,2.237536173503509,2.330756155269571,-0.3432652464765877,2.3968457390114244,0.0055471507816439,0.0,0.0020171457387796,0,1,0.0,0.0093900532551775,0.9988,0.123,0.074,0.803,Positive,Very Strong

look to mexico for your future  or any third world country or to univisions jorge ramos the ruling class in mexico is composed of europeanlooking white descendants of spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their spanish names in return british settlers in america brought women with them 
explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family 
one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing 
when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces  this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing 
as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants 
thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling 
and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation 
immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled 
in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling 
somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing 
in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack 
when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants 
even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two 
compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack 
 two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july   
 two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online july   
needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegalalien gang rape at all 
the ultimate primer on the bluecollar billionaire order ann coulters book in trump we trust e pluribus awesome 
by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place 
the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex 
those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican 
that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team 
similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one 
when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men 
conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam 
sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape 
 why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam 
 reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment 
perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good 
manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher 
our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe

the following excerpt is adapted from mendenhalls review of deirdre mccloskeys book bourgeois equality the original review which appeared in the quarterly journal of austrian economics is available here 
if its true that wayne booth inspired deirdre mccloskeys interest in the study of rhetoric then its also true  happily in my view  that mccloskey has refused to mimic booths programmatic formulaic methods and boorish insistence on prosaic succinctness bourgeois equality is mccloskeys third volume in a monumental trilogy that began with the bourgeois virtues  and bourgeois dignity  each published by the university of chicago press this latest volume is a big book alike in kind but not in theme to jacques barzuns from dawn to decadence  camille paglias sexual personae  or herald bermans law and revolution  and law and revolution ii  its meandering and personal blending scholarship with an essayistic style that recalls montaigne or emerson 
mccloskeys elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice at times humorous rambling and deliberately erratic she gives the distinct impression that shes simply telling a story one that happens to validate a thesis shes having fun imagine phillip lopate articulating economic history mccloskey is in this regard a latterday edward gibbon adopting a mode and persona thats currently unfashionable among mainstream historians except that shes more lighthearted than gibbon and unashamedly optimistic 
mccloskeys elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice at times humorous rambling and deliberately erratic she gives the distinct impression that shes simply telling a story one that happens to validate a thesis shes having fun imagine phillip lopate articulating economic history mccloskey is in this regard a latterday edward gibbon adopting a mode and persona thats currently unfashionable among mainstream historians except that shes more lighthearted than gibbon and unashamedly optimistic 
writing with an air of confidence mccloskey submits contra thomas piketty that ideas and ideology  not capital accumulation or material resources  have caused widespread economic development since  worldwide material wealth has increased and proliferated the quality of life in poor countries has risen  even if it remains unequal to that of more prosperous countries and the typical human being now enjoys access to the food goods services medicine and healthcare that in earlier centuries were available to only a select few in the richest parts of the globe the transition from poverty to wealth was occasioned by shifting rhetoric that reflected an emerging ethical consensus the rhetoricalethical change involved peoples attitudes toward other humans p xxiii namely the recognition of shared experience and sympathy as adam smith stated in the theory of moral sentiments attributing human progress to ideas enables mccloskey to advocate the norms and principles that facilitated economic growth and social improvement eg class mobility and fluidity while generating extensive prosperity thus her project is at once scholarly and tendentious a study of the conditions and principles that in turn she promotes 
she argues that commercialism flourished in the eighteenth century under the influence of ideas  such as human equality of liberty in law and of dignity and esteem p xxix  that were packaged in memorable rhetoric and aesthetics not matter mainly but ideas caused the great enrichment p  in other words the original and sustaining causes of the modern world  were ethical not material and they included the new and liberal economic idea of liberty for ordinary people and the new and democratic social idea of dignity for them p xxxi this thesis about liberty and dignity is clear and unmistakable if only because it is repetitive mccloskey has a habit of reminding readersin case you missed her point the first second or fiftyseventh time aroundthat the causes of the industrial revolution and the great enrichment were ideas not narrowly economic or political or legal changes p  she maintains to this end that the scottish enlightenment succeeded in combining the concepts of liberty and dignity into a desirable form of equalitynot equality of outcomes of course but of opportunity and treatment under the law and the scottish model to her mind stands in contradistinction to the french example of centralized topdown codification command planning and design 
a perennial villain lurks in the pages of her history the clerisy which is an appendage of the bourgeoisie p  and often dubbed the elite in regular parlance mccloskey calls the clerisy the sons of bourgeois fathers p xvii and neoaristocratic p  the clerisy includes those artists intellectuals journalists professionals and bureaucrats who resent the commercial and bettering bourgeoisie p xvi the clerisy seeks in different ways at different times to extinguish unfettered competition with exclusive illiberal irrevocable grants and privileges that are odious to free society and offensive to the rights of average consumers early on says mccloskey referring to the period in europe after the revolutionary year  the clerisy began to declare that ordinary people are misled in trading and so require expert protection and supervision p  the clerisy since then has been characterized by paternalism and a sense of superiority 
because the clerisy is shapeshifting assuming various forms from time to time and place to place its a tough concept to pin down the word clerisy does not appear in the books index to permit further scrutiny by contrast mccloskeys general arguments are easy to follow because the book is separated into parts with questions as their titles subparts consisting of onesentence headings answer those questions 
in a massive tour de force such as this readers are bound to take issue with certain interpretive claims historians will find mccloskeys summaries to be too breezy even libertarians will accuse her of overlooking manifest wrongs that occurred during the periods she surveys my complaints are few but severe for instance mccloskey is i believe either careless or mistaken to announce that during the nineteenth and early twentieth century under the influence of a version of science in a territory thats never specifically identified the right seized upon social darwinism and eugenics to devalue the liberty and dignity of ordinary people and to elevate the nations mission above the mere individual person recommending for example colonialism and compulsory sterilization and the cleansing power of war p xviii 
lets hope that its innocent negligence rather than willful distortion that underlies this odd unqualified categorical assertion adam cohens imbeciles  and thomas c leonards illiberal reformers  describe how in the united states social darwinism and eugenics were adopted primarily though not exclusively by the left not the right these recent books come on the heels of several scholarly treatments of this subject thomas m shapiros population control politics  philip r reillys the surgical solution  joel braslows mental ills and bodily cures  wendy klines building a better race  stefan kuhls the nazi connection  nancy ordovers american eugenics  christine rosens preaching eugenics  christina cogdells eugenic design  gregory michael dorrs segregations science  paul a lombardos edition a century of eugenics in america  and alexander minna sterns eugenic nation  these represent only a small sampling 
is mccloskey unware of these texts probably not she reviewed leonards book for reason although she did so after her own book reached press at any rate would she have us believe that emma goldman george bernard shaw eugene debs marie stopes margaret sanger john maynard keynes lester ward and w e b du bois were eugenicist agitators for the political right if so she should supply her definition of right since it would go against commonly accepted meanings on the matter of colonialism and war selfidentified members of the old right such as albert jay nock john flynn and senator robert taft advocated precisely the opposite of what mccloskey characterizes as right these men opposed among other things military interventionism and adventurism the trouble is that mccloskeys muddying of the signifiers left and right comes so early in the bookin the exordium that readers may lose trust in her question her credibility and begin to suspect the labels and arguments in her later chapters 
other undefined terms only make matters worse ensuring that mccloskey will alienate many academics who as a class are already inclined to reject her libertarian premises she throws around the term romanticism as if its referent were eminently clear and uncontested a conservative and romantic vision p xviii science fiction and horror fiction are  offshoots of romanticism p  jane austen is not a romantic novelist  because she does not take art as a model for life and does not elevate the artist to a lonely pinnacle of heroism or worship of the middle ages or adopt any of the other antibourgeois themes of novalis franz brentano sir walter scott and later romantics p  romanticism around  revived talk of hope and faith and a love for art or nature or the revolution as a necessary transcendent in peoples lives p  romantic candor p  the late eighteenthcentury romantic literary critics in england had no idea what john milton was on about sic because they had set aside the rigorously calvinist theology that structured his poetry p  the nationalist tradition of romantic writing of history p  romantic  hostilities to  democratic rhetoric p  in the eighteenth century  the idea of autonomy triumphed at any rate among the progressive clerisy and then became a leading romantic idea á la victor hugo p  and the romantic conservative thomas carlyle p  
to allege that the clerisy was thrilled by the romantic radicalism of books like mein kampf or what is to be done p xviii is also recklessly to associate the philosophies of say keats or coleridge or wordsworth with the exterminatory fantasies of hitler and lenin mccloskey might have guarded against this misleading conflation by distinguishing german idealism or contextualizing hegel or by being more vigilant with diction and definition her loose language will leave some experts i do not profess to be one scratching or shaking their heads and more problematic some nonexperts with misconceptions and misplaced targets of enmity one imagines the overeager and wellmeaning undergraduate having read bourgeois equality setting out to demonize william blake or destroy the reputation of percy shelly about whom paul cantor has written judiciously wouldnt originality imagination creativity and individualismwidely accepted markers of romanticismappeal to mccloskey yet her unconditionally derogatory treatment of romanticismwhich she portrays as a fixed monolithic selfevident thingundermines aspects of that fluctuating movement period style culture and attitude that are or seem to be consistent with her weltanschauung 
but i protest too much these complaints should not diminish what mccloskey has accomplished would that we had more grand studies that mapped ideas and traced influences across cultures communities and eras mccloskey takes the long view as we all should her focus on rhetoric is crucial to the future of liberty if given the technological advances we have made the work we do will be more and more about decisions and persuading others to agree changing minds and less and less about implementation by hand p  equally significant is her embrace of humanomicsdefined as the story of a complete human being with her ethics and language and upbringing p xxwhich materializes in casual references to henrik ibsens plays challenges to the depiction of john milton as a lonely poet in a garret writing merely to the starry heavens p  analyses of jane austens novels and portrayals of elizabethan england her historical and narrative arc enables us to contextualize our own moment with all of its troubles and possibilities 
best of all her book is inspiring and exhilarating and brimming with rousing imperatives and moving calls to action let us then she says at one point not reject the blessings of economic growth on account of planning or pessimism the busybody if wellintentioned rationalism of some voices of the french enlightenment or the adolescent if charming doubts of some voices of the german romantic movement fashionable though both attitudes have long been among the clerisy as rational optimists let us celebrate the great enrichment and the rhetorical changes in freer societies that caused it p  at another point she encourages her audience to guard against both cynicism and utopianism p  and elsewhere to heed tradetested cooperation competition and conservation in the right mix p  these little nudges lend her credibility insofar as they reveal her true colors as it were and demonstrate that she is not attemptingas is the academic wontto hide her prejudices and conceal her beliefs behind pretended objectivities 
poverty is relative and hence permanent and ineradicable despite mccloskeys claim that we can end poverty p  if tomorrow we woke up and the wealth of each living person were magically to multiply twentyfoldeven fiftyfoldthere would still be people at the bottom the quality of life at the bottom however would be vastly improved the current manifestation of global poverty shows how far we as a species have advanced in the last few centuries mccloskey is right we should pursue the ideas that accelerated and achieved human flourishing that demonstrably brought people out of distress and destitution hard sciences and mathematical models are insufficient in themselves to convey the magnitude and splendor of these ideas and their accomplishments hence we should welcome and produce more books like mccloskeys that undertake a rhetoricalethical revaluation to both examine and celebrate a society of open inquiry one which not only depends on rhetoric in its politics and in its science and in its economy but which also yields intellectual creativity and political freedom p  in mccloskeys approach economics and the humanities are not mutually exclusive rather they are mutually illuminating and in fact indispensably and inextricably tied an economics that forsakes the dignity of the human person and his capacity for creativity and aesthetics does so at its own peril and to its own disgrace all economics is at its core humanomics we could do without the latter term if we understood the former newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,7.057613867992074,38,7,14825,2325,5.34494623655914,2325.0,-0.7325539033172883,-0.5778293249656962,3.134169561501068,2.8669029854713903,0.2524733438967195,2.9455274717875732,0.0021505376344086,0.0,0.0012903225806451,0,1,0.0,0.0039997121632839,0.9998,0.177,0.079,0.744,Positive,Very Strong

KD7ONE,no title,"whether you are looking to attract a longterm girlfriend or wife or you are experimenting with shorterterm liaisons learning the art of seduction is essential reams of content have been written on the topic both on rok and elsewhere indeed its possible to get lost in a tsunami of pickup advice
but while it can be useful to absorb successful peoples techniques a shortcut is to observe their habits and adopt them yourself to that end here is a list of the top five habits ive observed in men who are great with women
 they take every opportunity 
guys who are great with women recognize and take up every opportunity that is presented to them in this way they are somewhat akin to entrepreneurs they know that the market is in a constant state of flux and that change is at the heart of opportunity as such like the speculators of pussy they are they are never afraid to launch a takeover bid regardless of the circumstances
game writers will often advise men that they should be approaching all the time i would wholeheartedly endorse this i would also add that however many opportunities youre taking now there are always more to be had i for example will try to get my first approach of the day in in the morning while im traveling to my office on the subway there are so many cute girls on their way to work in london or any reasonablysized commuter city and yet guys wont talk to them rationalizing that it is too early shell think im crazy or whatever in actual fact ive probably taken more phone numbers and set up more dates through morning approaches than at any other time
so next time you are out and about and see an attractive girl be sure to approach her whatever the time or the circumstances it is only by being present and open to all prospects that you will truly optimize your game
 they notice and follow up on iois 
while most game advice is centered on what the guy should do in order to attract the girl the fact remains that there will be many times that girls will shoot you socalled indicators of interest or iois without you having done anything
while i would never advise anyone to rely on these as a mainstay i would counsel that you should always at least do your best to notice them and to follow up with alacrity not only do direct iois frequently lead to sex but also if you fail to pursue a potentiallyinterested girl you may find yourself regretting it for a long time afterwards men after all are the more romantic gender there are few more lasting selfinflicted wounds than the thought of that beautiful girl who smiled at you at the museum and who you just know you could have dated had you had the courage to speak to her
the successful seducer is always on the lookout for iois therefore and hell execute quickly when he gets them even if it means deviating slightly from his routine for example a while back i was on a subway train when i got strong direct eye contact from an attractive petite and very feminine brunettejust my type once youve been in the game a while you will learn to distinguish a solid ioi from casual interest but the best way to describe it is as that rabbit in the headlights look that girls give when they are truly smitten
well she was giving me that look and i knew i had to follow up when she got of the train i went right after her introduced myself on the platform took her number and then left a drink and then several awesome sex sessions ensued later had i not taken the time to go after her then we would never have connected
remember always be willing to go after a sure thing and never leave money on the table
 they stand out from the crowd 
every truly successful seducer i have ever known has found ways to differentiate himself and stand out from the crowd this can manifest itself in many ways but primarily im talking about standing out physically in terms of what you wear and standing out in terms of your personality
while the old concept of peacocking is rightly maligned by both men and women these days there can nevertheless be little argument with the fact that all else being equal the better dressed man will be more successful than his slacksandsweatshirt counterpart a former colleague of mine who has slept with more women than anyone else ive ever met was particular about his clothes to the point of obsession
i appreciate that this will immediately cause some people to question his masculinity what real man takes so much care over his clothes but remember that narcissism is one of the three dark triad characteristics that are like catnip to women along with machiavellianism and psychopathy therefore taking time to select a silk pocket square that contrasts dramatically with your blazer plus the right trousers and shoes will help your cause a lotif you remember that your main aim is to stand out rather than blend in
your personality too should be larger than life dont be obnoxious but as a rule of thumb try to ensure that you are louder and have more to say than the other men in the group
 they are dominant 
there can be no doubt that women are attracted to masculine men and that means that to be a contender you need to be dominant now of course the massive and blatantly obvious caveat here is that you should also be ultimately respectful and appreciate that no means no nevertheless within these boundaries it will serve you well to ensure that your body language your tone of voice and your general demeanor communicates dominance  both of the woman you are interacting with as well as any men in your vicinity
the key thing here is to appear decisive and unwaveringeven if secretly you arent for example after youve had a couple of drinks with a girl on a date try getting up taking her by the hand and simply leading her to a taxi when she questions what youre doing just say were going back to my place to watch a movie doing this will communicate that you have had similar success with women before and that you are not intimidated by her
now in the back of your mind you may well be uncertain that she will acquiesce and thats fine  just do the actions anyway and see what happens shes much more likely to want to go home with you if you demonstrate leadership and even if she doesnt she will still respect you more which will pay dividends the next time you meet
 they dont apologize 
highly successful seducers never apologizeor certainly not for minor social infractions anyway the fact of the matter is you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs if you are the kind of guy who frequently approaches women while demonstrating leadership and a certain kind of cockyfunny humor then the chances are youre going to offend someone every so often
now im not recommending that you should be a dickbe classy and convivial in all your interactions but the truth of the matter is that the real seducer always ruffles a few feathers in his quest for vaginal valhalla if someone gets offended then make a joke but dont apologize as long as have acted lawfully then you have nothing to be sorry for
remember an apology is a submission to someone elses frameand that is never a good look

the un refugee agency also known as the unhcr says the number of refugees who died in the mediterranean sea on their way to europe in  has reached an alltime high 
we can confirm that at least  people have been reported dead or missing in the mediterranean sea so far this year making the death toll in  the highest ever recorded said the un refugee agency spokesman william spindler on wednesday 
the alarming surge which surpassed the death toll of  for  comes despite a considerable decline in the number of refugees crossing the mediterranean in  
more than a million people reached europe via the mediterranean in  while fewer than  crossings have been reported so far this year 
the number of refugees heading to europe has declined as the european union in march signed a controversial deal with turkey aimed at stemming the flow of refugees into the continent by forcing those deported from the eu to either be located in turkey or go back to the original country of departure 
since then the route between libya and italy across the central mediterranean has become the main way as pathways to greece have been closed down 
according to the agency the likelihood of perishing in the shorter route between turkey and greece was one in  while one death for every  arrivals was reported in the most perilous route between libya and italy in  
the unhcr attributed the surge mainly to the overcrowded lower quality vessels flimsy inflatable rafts often used by smugglers in this october   photo provided by seawatch aid group refugees sit in an inflatable boat off the libyan coast in the mediterranean sea via ap 
 refugees found dead in mediterranean sea msf says 
earlier on wednesday doctors without borders known as the msf by its french acronym said  bodies had been retrieved from a refugee boat during a rescue operation in the mediterranean

the recovery operation which took place with the help of a team from the berlinbased nongovernmental organization seawatch took a long time as the boat was flooded with a mixture of fuel and seawater 
the mixture of water and fuel was so foul that we could not stay on the boat for long periods it was horrible said michele telaro the msf project leader 
the msf also saved  people aboard another dinghy on tuesday seawatch recovered a body in another operation 
the italian coast guard reported that  refugees were rescued from overcrowded boats on tuesday

two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered nfl fan the game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage 
democrats can be counted upon to call the republican opponent racist whether the opponent is the priestly mitt romney or the supreme court justice who wrote the dred scott decision donald trump you see is racist because among other reasons at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my africanamerican hillary clinton on the other hand is not antisemitic even though three witnesses one of whom took and passed a polygraph claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a fing jew bastard 
with a republican candidate the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small real or imagined  while giving the democrat a pass so trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of clintons flatout lie during the third debate when she insisted that the supreme court heller case was about toddlers as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms 
in heller nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear clinton a year ago flatout said the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment to normal people this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on which again was whether we as individuals have a right to keep and bear arms 
meanwhile we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal when the accurate description is national security scandal the espionage act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters the law does not require as fbi director james comey falsely stated an intent nor is it relevant as clinton insists whether or not her private server the one she maintained in her basement was hacked 
five people who worked with or for clinton including her chief of staff all received immunity deals something normally given to get someone to flip on a target some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed but the target that is to say hillary clinton was deemed by comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted so why the immunity deals who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned who cares 
clinton insists that president obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy this would be the economy in which for the first time in history a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least  percent growth in gross domestic product this would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that gallup ceo jim clifton calls the big lie given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are underemployed 
meanwhile its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed groped touched or made fun of by trump has appeared with her attorney feminist gloria allred allred a clinton supporter sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of trumps sexual misconduct and her support for clinton who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers one such accuser juanita broaddrick claims not only that she was raped by bill clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape hillary clinton verbally threatened her 
hillary clinton mind you has never been asked by anyone in the media about broaddricks allegation never and only one national reporter sam donaldson has ever asked bill clinton about juanita broaddricks allegation ever clintons answer he referred donaldson to his lawyer david kendall donaldson quickly tried again asking the thenpresident to simply deny it same answer my attorney  speaks for me and that was that 
so hillary clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since  who has clearly violated the espionage act and placed the nations security at risk who told the benghazi victims families that the death of four americans was inspired by a video while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different whose charitable foundation engaged in paytoplay in haiti so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and nondonors went to the back of the line who wants to gut the second amendment who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of isis russia and the chinese and whose media compadres including scribes with the new york times washington post and cnbc have been outed by wikileaks as colluding with her campaign and she is now oddson favorite to become the next president of the united states receive larry elders commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for larry elders alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",whatreallyhappened.com,Fake,english,10.391474129648817,23.401690216082972,29,5,5334,911,4.835345773874863,911.0,-1.0077292574050325,-0.9536307555522068,0.62311984610277,0.6502023483211784,-0.2504523359230851,0.677001243292034,0.0021953896816684,0.0,0.0,0,2,0.0,0.0054379069413811,-0.9851,0.092,0.115,0.793,Negative,Very Strong

the new york times publisher and executive editor have promised to rededicate the paper to its fundamental mission  to report america and the world honestly without favors and fear the paper claims they will strive to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in stories brought to the public this announcement is almost considered an apology to its readers for providing a year and a half of unbalanced and unhinged coverage of the presidential race 
sean hannity suggests that trump must ignore the media and trust his gut instincts he was sad to see the yearold paper destroy their credibility over the election season it was obvious to dedicated readers that the times had abandoned its old coverage standards stories were unrelentingly hostile towards trump and his supporters reporters were including their personal opinions and political analysis in the news coverage this allowed animosity toward trump to be spread all over social media by political reporters front page stories on the new york times were accusing trump of lying but the paper never published the same findings in reference to hillary clinton  the papers liberal readership has even gotten tired of reporting that resembles state controlled propaganda of totalitarian regimes newt gingrich destroys the new york times credibility with seven simple questions 
the new york times has struggled mightily to answer some serious questions posed by the former united states house of representatives speaker gingrich a republican has asked the times whether they have any reporters editors or columnists that will say they voted for trump he elaborated to ask if they have since hired any trump supporters to work those positions for the times the paper struggled to say whether or not it has hired any republican reporters at all 
gingrich has also asked if the new york times has changed its policies allowing journalists to express their opinions about events and people they are covering the fourth question asked by gingrich wondered if the times reporters would surrender any pulitzer prizes awarded for news stories containing personal opinions here are the final questions that the times struggled to address have its editors retracted misleading news headlines that expressed opinions  such as the papers coverage of trumps tax returns has it fired reporters who admitted to writing politically motivated news stories and encouraged interview subjects to talk to them so they could stop trump has it retracted its shameful electioneve frontpage story reporting on trumps innermost thoughts and feelings virtually every sentence of which is filled with reporters opinions and speculationsfeaturing claims like he is struggling to suppress his bottomless need for attention

No Author,debate washingtons syria policy,"society us supreme court justice clarence thomas 
a female lawyer has accused us supreme court justice clarence thomas of sexually assaulting her in  a report says 
moira smith who works as a corporate lawyer with an alaska energy company said the judge made unwanted sexual advances on her during a dinner party when she was yearold the national law journal reported on thursday 
she said thomas grabbed and squeezed her buttocks several times during the party in falls church virginia 
justice thomas touched me inappropriately and without my consent smith said 
he groped me while i was setting the table suggesting i should sit right next to him smith said 
he was  or  inches down and he got a good handful and he kept squeezing me and pulling me close to him she stated according to the journal 
in a statement to the national law journal thomas  dismissed the allegation as preposterous saying that the incident never happened 
smith currently vice president and general counsel at enstar natural gas co in alaska said she decided to speak out after hearing republican presidential nominee donald trumps lewd comments about women 
a  video was released earlier this month by the washington post in which trump can be heard making lewd comments about women and bragging about groping them 
a number of women have since come forward claiming that the business mogul has sexually assaulted them 
trump has called the allegations slander and libel and part of a concerted coordinated and vicious attack by democratic candidate hillary clinton and the news media to undercut his campaign moira smith said justice clarence thomas groped her at her boss dinner party when she was

# 1 NWO Hatr,de blasio administration finds a way to ruin food trucks,"off the grid news  by daniel jennings 
a public school official in florida has urged citizens to fight truancy by reporting any children they suspect might not be in school or being educated  including homeschool families 
it is all part of an antitruancy initiative called operation round up in which residents of jackson county florida are urged to be on the lookout for children not in school and to report them to school officials or to police 
a truancy report can lead to a home check by sheriffs deputies or police and possibly the arrest of the parents tv station wjhg reported 
the policy of the jackson county school district is to send law enforcement to the homes of suspected truants 
sometimes if these citizens dont call me i have no way of knowing shirl williams director of student services for the school system told the tv station so if its a nosy neighbor be a nosy neighbor just call me and let me check out the situation 
williams acknowledged that homeschool children can be mistaken for truants but urged citizens to report them so school authorities can investigate 
sometimes the community will see them around town and they think hey theyre not being educated sometimes the community is right williams said 
home school legal defense association attorney tj schmidt wrote williams and the jackson county superintendent saying that while truancy is a problem homeschoolers should not be targeted 
your statements suggest that everyone should report children they think arent being educated the letter read in our opinion this is a threatening practice and will instill a spirit of suspicion and hostility against homeschoolers in the community 
schmidt wrote to williams after a parent saw her on tv and complained to hsdla

Letsbereal,no title,"the following post was sponsored by chad cocker and written by matt forney 
everyone says that you shouldnt judge a book by its cover but thats really difficult when the cover makes you throw up a little in your mouth thats how i felt when i was tasked with writing a review of chad t cockers memoirs of a misogynist an erotic novel for men  what kind of man would want to read an erotic novel romance and erotica are female masturbation material trying to write a harlequin novel men is like marketing lesbian porn to actual lesbians
or so i thought
despite the packaging memoirs of a misogynist is one of the best works ive read this year contrary to cockers marketing the novel is a examination of life as a man in modern america filtered through the protagonists relationships with women while it starts slowly cockers prose and honesty save the day and make memoirs of a misogynist absolutely worth your time and money
from the marquis de sade to neomasculinity 
because mainstream publishing almost exclusively caters to women underground and independent writers have turned to fill the void of malecentric literature from braggadocios fratire writers like tucker max and maddox to loser lit authors such as andy nowicki and ann sterzinger to our very own roosh and quintus curtius theres a surfeit of alternative writing for men who are sick of the misandry and feminism of the real literary world
viewed against the backdrop of alternative publishing memoirs of a misogynist is an odd animal indeed when i first picked it up i assumed it would be a tellall memoir along the lines of rooshs a dead bat in paraguay or a roman à clef in the fashion of charles bukowskis work however it does indeed live up to its subtitle as much of the novel is devoted to lengthy detailed descriptions of the protagonists sexual encounters
shed also gotten used to her chastity belt and that scared her it still didnt sit well with her that master had total control over her sexual gratification slave was constantly wet and horny and that made her even more compliant the orgasms that master gave her were unlike anything she had experienced before they were mindblowing even after a year together their sex was electric and deeply satisfying
in the introduction cocker warns us that the book is possibly the dirtiest most depraved and most offensive novel youve ever read making me wonder if hes ever heard of  days of sodom still the structure of memoirs plot and the skill of cockers prose shows that hes both acquainted with classic erotica and has actually had sex with a lot of girls the first half of the book is reminiscent of pauline reages story of o in which a woman is systematically trained to become a sex slave
interestingly memoirs of a misogynist also seems inspired by venus in furs not the velvet underground song but the erotic novel by leopold von sachermasoch its from sachermasoch that we derive the term masochism the tendency to derive sexual pleasure from pain akin to how sadism is derived from sade as the plot revolves around a man who desires nothing more than to be utterly subservient to his mistress severins humiliation at the hands of his lover drives him to become a misogynist in the same way that cockers protagonist is one
that woman as nature has created her and man at present is educating her is mans enemy she can only be his slave or his despot but never his companion this she can become only when she has the same rights as he and is his equal in education and work
its worth noting that sachermasoch was a feminist and believed that equal relationships with women would only become possible with womens liberation insert your own joke here
power doesnt care what you need as long as youre on your knees 
enjoying memoirs of a misogynist requires you to get past the initial few chapters which read like fifty shades of grey with about  extra iq points the initial plot concerns melinda a runaway who falls into the care of a wealthy man who goes unnamed for most of the book after offering her room and board the man and melinda begin a relationship sealed by a contract where she agrees to become his sexual plaything
my body is my masters it is his blank canvas for him to modify as many times and in as many different ways as he chooses he could hear her breath quickening as he read he will control my bodily functions most particularly my orgasms i will only orgasm when my master allows me 
what saves the bookand what kept me readingwas its depiction of the protagonist henceforth referred to as master far from the masturbatory blank slate that christian grey was cocker depicts master as a complex and conflicted character constantly trying to rationalize the way he treats melinda later rechristened slave cockers deft writing kept me wondering what the protagonists motivations were all the way to the end the book also frequently switches to melindas perspective while its usually a challenge for male writers to depict female characters and vice versa cocker is skilled enough to make her compelling as well
where memoirs really picks up is in the second half which is set nearly ten years later the focus shifts to elizabeth avery a disgraced doctor stripped of her medical license after shes caught abusing a male patient destitute and despondent she accepts a job as the personal physician of masters stable of whores his lifestyle offending her feminist sensibilities
doctor averys world was spinning she tried to distance herself this was just a patient after all she was being paid a significant amount of money for this jobthe kind of money that would solve a lot of her problems regardless she couldnt help but be disgusted that a woman had allowed herself to be treated this way hed said she consented to this in fact the way she looked at the man showed she clearly loved him and was a willing participant in her modifications and degradation the woman or melinda as the man had called her looked up at him with what the doctor could only call adoration
once again it would have been easy for cocker to depict elizabeth as a raging braburning feminist stereotype but he agilely avoids clichés in favor of nuance elizabeth isnt portrayed as a firebreathing misandrist but as a woman who unthinkingly absorbs leftist cant and has her life ruined because of it the final chapters of the book show elizabeth tussling with the sexual arousal she feels working for mr x her name for the protagonist and her attempts to maintain her beliefs as the evidence of her failed life piles up i wont spoil the ending other than to say that after finishing the book i had to sit on it and digest it for a few days
each chapter of memoirs begins with a factual statistic about the state of men and boys in america today a jarring contrast with the depravity of the books action i initially wondered why they were there but as i approached the end of the book it all suddenly clicked memoirs of a misogynist is a biting look at what our toxic sexual marketplace does to men and women american dating is like an acid bath no one who dives into it comes out unscathed even men who are successful at getting laid are affected by what they have to do to get ahead there are no winners no saints and no role models just people trying to make the best of a broken system
as i stated earlier memoirs takes a while to really get going and if youre not into lascivious descriptions of sex the book wont appeal to you but if you want a haunting piercing look at the horror show of modern gender relations memoirs of a misogynist is a mustbuy i cant wait to see what cocker comes up with next

No Author,quiz how much of a political junkie are you,"email 
with millions of eyes watching cnn for election results tonight the network really couldnt afford any highprofile screwups but unfortunately thats exactly what they got when john king tapped his touchscreen electoral map too hard and plunged himself straight into a digital hellscape from which there seems to be no escape 
ouch thats some major egg on cnns face 
the night appeared to be going smoothly in the networks washington studio until king tried to zoom in on a breakdown map of crucial ohio swing districts when the map seemed to freeze up a frustrated king tapped the magic wall with enough force that his whole arm plunged through the suddenly fluid surface of the screen before wolf blitzer or anderson cooper could step in he had been fully engulfed in a vast virtual expanse of colorful swirling data 
with millions of americans tuning in to watch the results of this historic election cnn has been forced to press on even as they try to free john king from the computerized map a noticeably emotional wolf blitzer mouthed the words im sorry to his imprisoned colleague before tapping the board to call up a gender breakdown of likely oregon voters the bar graph of which animated right into john kings spine launching nearly all the way to the midatlantic states if cnn producers thought that they had stabilized the situation by urging king to take refuge in the bottom corner of the screen it did not take long for them to realize how wrong they were when connecticut was called for hillary clinton the trapped john king was also turned entirely blue and let loose a horrible scream as if he were being burned alive this level of panic was matched moments later when king tried to fend off a ravenous piece of malware with just his loafer only for the shoe to shatter into pixels that the code devoured 
yikes cnn will be wondering for a while how this all went so wrong and on their biggest night too 
with plenty of states left to declare tonight theres still time for king to be rescued from the computerized nightmare but with uploading a jpeg of a ladder for him to climb up and trying to shepherd him onto a thumb drive having already failed to return king to the studio cnn may be running out of options 
no matter how this shakes out its clear cnn has a major technology fail on their hands then again this is just what happens when anchors play with tech toys without reading the instructions well better luck in  guys",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,43,9,2452,438,4.582191780821918,438.0,-0.579678706601875,-0.2020278943791856,-0.1393757054490046,-0.0913106653789985,-0.5002905000892158,-0.0818480537931075,0.0068493150684931,0.0,0.0,0,3,0.0,0.01696552473835,-0.9839,0.075,0.129,0.796,Negative,Very Strong

late on friday evening the fbi announced the reopening of its investigation of hillary clinton and her opprobrious emails and the department of justice quickly followed suit on monday vowing to dedicate all needed resources to quickly review emails in the clinton case according to a tweet by the associated press  breaking justice dept says itll dedicate all needed resources to quickly review emails in clinton case 
 the associated press ap october   
both announcements made after clinton aid huma abedins emails were discovered on estranged husband anthony weiners computer come amid growing internal contention as the fbi and doj parse out how to deal with the pressure of a rapidly approaching presidential election as well as public perception the original investigation had been purposely bumbled in favor of the democratic nominee 
however welcome or unwelcome the news of reopened investigations might be one major detail  revealed in wikileaks ongoing publications of clinton campaign chair john podestas emails  presents evidence the justice departments probe could amount to little more than a smoke screen to placate an irate public 
assistant attorney general peter kadzik promised congress in a letter the justice department will continue to work closely with the fbi and together dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible breaking senior doj official sends letter to lawmakers responding to request for more information about email review days pictwittercompcgtodkqd 
 just the facts jtf_news october   
perhaps that vow from a government branch putatively dedicated to ensuring the criminal element is duly punished for misbehavior should reassure those increasingly suspicious of an obviouslyrigged system 
perhaps before wikileaks revealed interdepartmental communications and corruption that promise might have held weight beyond a symbolic gesture of obligation  but as podestas emails reveal its entirely possible this reopened investigation is failed from the start 
kadzik in fact maintains a cozy enough relationship with podesta to have had dinner with the clinton insider just one day after the former secretary of state testified before the house select committee on benghazi last october 
and the pairs familiarity isnt held to a simple dinner party as the daily caller reported  podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 
so kadzik  an extremely close friend to the chair of hillary clintons presidential campaign  is tasked with heading the newly reopened investigation of hillary clinton 
clinton couldnt ask for an arrangement better situated to again find insufficient evidence worthy of bringing charges against her as far as conflicts of interest go this takes the cake 
the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust matthew whitaker told the daily caller  
if political wranglings and connections marred transparency and neutrality the first time around it would be reasonable to assume the players havent since magically unentangled themselves from clinton and her campaign mere days before americans take to the polls 
its the kind of thing the american people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of hillary clinton whitaker continued also noting the controversial meeting between bill clinton and attorney general loretta lynch on an airport tarmac in phoenix during the dojs previous investigation 
in fact kadzik as an obama appointee to the justice department beginning in  also initiated the effort to have loretta lynch appointed to the role of attorney general 
and the friendship between kadzik and podesta  as well as their connections to the obama administration and additional officials overseeing the clinton investigation  spans decades 
in  for example as the washington free beacon reported from one of the leaked emails podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik have a supportive role in obamas presidential campaign  particularly because the latter was a fantastic lawyer who managed to keep podesta out of jail 
although kadzik as head of the office of legislative affairs does not have a direct role in chain of command for the clinton investigation he does field inquiries from congress concerning her emails 
noted by the daily caller  in november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation which sparked outrage by the gop over potential conflicts of interest 
florida rep ron desantis voiced particular concerns about lynchs longtime connections to the clintons in a february   letter  and that obamas appointees are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as department of justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the democratic nomination for president of the united states 
while the daily caller s report goes much further in depth concerning the relationships of podesta and kadzik with the clintons and their insiders it can be easily surmised in even a simple perusal of facts there could be no possible way an investigation this critical  and with resounding implications  would maintain any semblance of impartiality 
when julian assange vociferously denounces the us electoral and political systems as rigged beyond repair these connections are precisely what hes referring to

the amish who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the anabaptists have typically stayed out of politics in the past as a general rule they dont vote serve in the military or engage in any other displays of patriotism this year however the aab has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process 
over the past eight years the democratic party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues said aab chairman menno simons we have seen more and more christians being persecuted for their faith we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage now they want to put a woman in the nations highest leadership role in direct violation of  timothy  we need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles donald trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the lords way 
according to statistician nate silver of the website fivethirtyeightcom there are no possible scenarios in which hillary clinton can win with donald trump carrying the amish vote 
the amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like pennsylvania virginia ohio indiana and iowa silver noted they also have strong numbers in reliably democratic states like michigan illinois and new york meaning that hillary will lose those states as well there is also a sizeable community in florida which while not as large as it is in the midwest is still large enough to turn florida for trump over the next two weeks you can expect hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models 
the clinton campaign issued a written statement to the aab asking them to reconsider their decision 
i dont believe that donald trump is the person who best represents your interests clinton wrote to the aab as a career real estate developer he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life as former first lady of arkansas i understand the concerns of rural americans more than any candidate in this election i implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent 
most pundits believe that mrs clintons plea is too little too late 
during a press conference in manhattan trump thanked the aab for their support and promised to put the amish to work maintaining government buildings which he said would save taxpayers millions because the amish do great work for a very low price 
though clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end many of her campaign workers have already resigned according to the associated press it is expected that the clinton campaign will lose  of its staff over the next two weeks there is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the clinton camp and many simply want to cut their losses 
it looked like she was going to win this election easily said paul horner a campaign worker in ohio but this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant cleary mrs clinton took far too much for granted in this race and we are all now paying the price its really sad to see the campaign end this way

EdJenner,obama tells black voters trump would tolerate kkk support in office,"christie lost republicans the  election he may be losing them the  election too by ben shapiro november   
ambition can be dangerous not just for the ambitious man or woman but for the country  for all those who ally with the ambitious person 
for the last eight years one of the most ambitious men in politics has been new jersey governor chris christie hailed as a conservative darling after taking on teachers unions in new jersey  brash language about punching them in the face marked his rise as a political force and an upandcomer in presidential politics  christie has nearly singlehandedly destroyed the republican party in two straight presidential elections 
in  christie was considered and rejected for vice president by mitt romney  but then gave the keynote speech in primetime at the republican convention there he spent the bulk of his time talking about his own wonders ignoring romney completely fox news chris wallace called the speech the most curious keynote speech i have ever heardfor a moment i forgot who was the nominee of the party 
then the week before the election hurricane sandy hit the east coast while new york governor andrew cuomo told president obama that his presence was unnecessary christie invited obama to new jersey then hugged him and took him on a tour of atlantic city where they made political love along the boardwalk underneath the cloudy skies i cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state christie said adding that it was my honor to introduce president obama christie was at the time facing down rumors that thennewark mayor corey booker who is black would run against him as the new york times noted the scene played out on televisions around the country like a stirring campaign ad that hit themes of bipartisanship and crisis management  only it was run free of charge 
obama surged in the final days and beat romney handily 
fast forward three years 
christie was running in the republican primaries hed done nothing much in the polls his only hope was to somehow do well in new hampshire he had no support in states like south carolina or nevada or southern states dominated by support for donald trump ted cruz and marco rubio so naturally he used his presence at the debate before the new hampshire primary  a state in which rubio was surging following his iowa showing  to destroy rubio christie rightly labeled rubio a robotic candidate rubio repeated himself christie hit him again  and rubio fell apart in the polling trump ran away with the state almost immediately christie quit the race and fell in behind trump thanks in large part to christies help trump won the nomination 
now with trump surging in the polls the week before his general election against hillary clinton christie has struck again this time two of his top aides have been found guilty on all charges related to bridgegate the scandal in which the christie administration allegedly blocked bridges in order to punish a local democrat who wouldnt endorse christies reelection bid  this story will allow the media to shift its focus to the trump campaign since christie is leader of trumps white house transition team in a tight election it could be enough to hand hillary the white house 
so thanks chris christie

let us start with an historical fact treason and betrayal by the highest levels is a common feature of history whether it is judas vs jesus brutus vs julius caesar benedict arnold the rosenbergs jonathan pollard aldrich ames robert hanssen it is just a fact of life it does happen 
back in  when bill clinton was running for reelection he authorized the transfer of highly sensitive technology to china this technology had military applications and allowed china to close the gap in missile performance with the united states the transfers were opposed and severely criticized by the defense department 
at the same time bill clinton was transferring this technology to china huge donations began to pour into his reelection campaign from the us companies allowed to sell the technology to china and from american citizens of chinese descent the fact that they were us citizens allowed them to donate to political campaigns but it later emerged that they were acting as conduits for cash coming in from asian sources including chinese intelligence agencies the scandal eventually became known as chinagate 
john huang 
a close associate of indonesian industrialist james riady huang initially was appointed deputy secretary of commerce in  by  however he moved to the democratic national committee where he generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from foreign sources huang later pleaded guilty to one felony count of campaign finance violations 
charlie trie 
like john huang trie raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from foreign sources to democratic campaign entities he was a regular white house visitor and arranged meetings of foreign operators with clinton including one who was a chinese arms dealer his  contribution to clintons legal defense fund was returned after it was found to have been largely funded by asian interests trie was convicted of violating campaign finance laws in  
one of tries main sources of cash was chinese billionaire ng lap seng according to a senate report ng lap seng had connections to the chinese government seng was arrested in  over an unrelated bribery case but this gave investigators the opportunity to question seng about the chinagate scandal former united nations general assembly president john ashe was also caught in the bribery case and was about to testify to the links between the clintons and seng when he was found dead that very morning initially reported as having died from a heart attack johns throat had obviously been crushed at that point the official story changed to him accidentally dropping a barbell on his own throat 
ng lap seng with the clintons 
johnny chung 
gave more than  to the democratic national committee prior to the  campaign but it was returned after officials learned it came from illegal foreign sources chung later told a special senate committee investigating  clinton campaign fundraising that  of his contributions came from individuals in chinese intelligence chung pleaded guilty to bank fraud tax evasion and campaign finance violations 
chinagate documented by judicial watch was uncovered by judicial watch founder larry klayman technology companies allegedly made donations of millions of dollars to various democratic party entities including president bill clintons  reelection campaign in return for permission to sell hightech secrets to china bernard schwartz and his loral space  communication ltd later allegedly helped china to identify the cause of a rocket failure thereby advancing chinas missile program and threatening us national security according to records 
this establishes a history of the clintons treating us secrets as their own personal property and selling them to raise money for campaigns 
is history repeating itself it appears so

Daniel Greenfield,meet hillary clintons secretary of state,"a resolution on jerusalem that will fuel antijewish incitement and violence october   joseph puder 
if anyone doubted the fact that the united nations agencies harbored a deepseated antiisrael and antijewish animus the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco vote on jerusalem proved it the unesco world heritage committee voted this week october   on a resolution dealing with jerusalem drafted by the palestinian and jordanian delegations and submitted by kuwait lebanon and tunisia all arab muslim states the executive committee of unesco approved  for  opposed  abstained and  missing the resolution that was already voted on earlier this month in which  memberstates approved the resolution algeria bangladesh brazil cuba chad dominican republic egypt iran lebanon malaysia morocco mauritius mexico mozambique nicaragua nigeria oman pakistan qatar russia senegal south africa sudan and vietnam  opposed estonia germany lithuania the netherlands uk and the us among the abstaining  states were argentina france greece india japan kenya south korea spain sri lanka and sweden 
the resolution deeply decries the continuous israeli aggressions against civilians including islamic religious figures and priests decries the forceful entering into the different mosques and historic buildings and into muslim holy sites by israelis including employees of the socalled israeli antiquities israel is urged to end these aggressions and abuses which inflame the tension on the ground and between faiths 
according to hillel neuer executive director of un watch a genevabased watchdog organization the resolution which is likely to be adopted dangerously risks fueling antijewish incitement and violence and legitimizing the escalating palestinian denial of jewish and cultural rights neuer added that this inflammatory narrative praised last week by hamas rewards the past years relentless palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks in jerusalem and other parts of israel which we mustnt forget began with false claims that israel was planning to damage the holy muslim shrines 
the expected resolution mentions eleven times alharam alsharif the muslim designation to what jews call har habayit the holiest shrine in judaism where the temple of solomon stood and also known as temple mount with the islamic bloc controlling the largest voting bloc in the un it is no wonder that a resolution of this kind can be approved oic organization of islamic cooperation being the largest and most influential bloc at the un it might as well declare that the earth is flat and it will garner a majority vote at the general assembly or its other un constituent agencies what this resolution effectively does to jerusalem is to islamize sites historically belonging to other faiths 
the latest draft does not describe the western wall as the most hallowed remains of the jewish holy temple destroyed by the romans in ce but as the western wall of al aqsa mosque in a blatant effort to erase the jewish heritage and biblical truth and as part of a campaign to islamize the site it shamelessly disregards the fact that jewish worshippers have prayed at the wall for over two thousand years the language of the draft resolution continues the deliberate attempt by the palestinian authority pa to deny the jewish historical connection to the land of israel in general and to jerusalem in particular mahmoud abbas has continued on the path of denial that arafat initiated at camp david 
among the charges brought up by the pa and the other arabmuslim states for undertaking the resolution is that the jerusalem light rail which is used daily by thousands of arab residents of jerusalem is having a damaging effect on the visual integrity and the authentic character of the walls of the old city of jerusalem yet the rail tracks pass through an existing highway and facilitates effective transportation for visitors of all faiths 
preceding the shameless resolution and the vote that took place in the paris headquarters of unesco israels president reuven rivlin stated at an event in his jerusalem residence no forum or body in the world can come and deny the connection between the jewish people the land of israel and jerusalem  and any such body that does so simply embarrasses itself we can understand criticism but you cannot change history 
unescos director general irina bokova and the chairman of unescos executive board michael worbs expressed displeasure and apologized for the resolution in an interview with israeli tv channel  on october   the day following the vote worbs said he hoped that the boards tuesday meeting will be delayed in order to reach consensus on the resolution before a formal vote bokova on her part expressed her dismay at the resolution saying that efforts to deny history and the citys jerusalem complex multifaith character harms unesco 
earlier in july  bokova stated that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities have a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city to deny or conceal any of the jewish christian or muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site and runs counter to the reasons that justified its inscription in  as a world heritage site 
unesco can be counted as one of the most antiisrael un agencies in the course of a typical year the organizations legislative bodies will condemn israel  or more times with no criticism aimed at any other country in the world in  for example unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions  eight at the  st and  nd sessions of the executive board and two at the  th session of the general conference again in  unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board in  unesco again adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board and two resolutions against israel at the  th session of the general conference 
whereas jerusalem was king davids capital and continued to be the capital of the second jewish commonwealth as well as israels capital today it was never the capital of any arab or muslim empire caliphate or entity nor was jerusalem a spiritual center that muslims yearned for the umayyad caliphate had its capital in damascus the abbasside caliphate capital was baghdad and the ottoman empires caliphate capital was constantinople ramle a small town in israel was its administrative capital in palestine  not jerusalem a palestinian state never existed as an independent entity and the pa claims on jerusalem are strictly contrarian  to deny jerusalem as the heart of jewish spirituality and yearning jerusalem exists in every jewish prayer and is invoked on every occasion and holiday 
dore gold former director general of israels foreign ministry addressed last years unescos jerusalem resolution he pointed out that the resolution glossed over any jewish connection to jerusalem and it failed to acknowledge christianitys ties to jerusalem 
most dismaying is the fact that christian nations who voted for the resolution or abstained have abandoned all vestiges of pride and honor and are willing to deny historical truth for narrow political interests brazil mexico and the dominican republic predominantly catholic states are a case in point unfortunately other christian countries including france spain greece argentina and sweden who should know about jerusalem from their church bibles did not have the courage to reject this outrageously false resolution it can only lead to the conclusion that perhaps cowardice and latent antisemitism drove their decision to accept not reject this infamous resolution",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,40,6,7655,1216,5.256578947368421,1216.0,-0.671403824631123,-0.7657300402589515,1.237190691054772,1.1283449892906372,0.1652634957031367,1.166322671645032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.993,0.063,0.095,0.842,Negative,Very Strong

David G. Brown,wall street hollywood the media and sjws fail to stop donald trump from becoming americas th president,"leave a reply maureen moss  not a typical newsletter from me these are words that flowed forth this morning 
clearly the week ahead for the united states and those across the world will be one of the most significant in history the presidential election is historic in and of itself though the weeks to follow may prove to be more so nothing is as it appears to be 
we are in the beginning times of an entirely new civilization as was humanity some  years ago everything not harmonized with this new civilization will be dismantled not sometime in the future in the weeks directly in front of us 
hundreds of thousands of years and billions of people will be shaped by who we become individually and then collectively and how this earth is restructured by the events unfolding now 
we must trust we are being brought into harmony under the impulse of one system of operation 
long knowing that a new humanity and new global reality would be born in this our lifetime certainly we had little idea of how that would occur 
not all that long ago we came to know the responsibility we personally held to lift and stabilize our consciousness open wide our hearts and free ourselves from the captivity of a deceptive fearful lower nature having multiple realities 
certainly we started becoming aware of our desire to know ourselves authentically thus beginning the journey to return to a singular loving nature no longer conflicted by dual pillars of truth nor at odds or war with ourselves 
all this in divine right time and in preparation for a new reality to be born on earth it had to begin within ourselves 
certainly not as instinctively was how an entire distorted external reality politically socially economically and more operating in reverse truth riddled with deception lies and manipulation would come to find its true nature

Jason Easley,revived clinton email scandal killed by a slew of new facts in record time,"by sean colarossi on mon oct st  at  pm trump used a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the internal revenue service would likely declare it improper if he were audited share on twitter print this post 
while donald trump has repeatedly said he took advantage of loopholes that allowed him to legally pay nothing in federal income taxes for decades the new york times reported on monday that trump may have actually crossed a legal boundary to avoid paying his fair share 
according to the times the republican nominee used a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the internal revenue service would likely declare it improper if he were audited 
the report 
tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for the new york times said mr trumps tax avoidance maneuver conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time whatever loophole existed was not exploited here but stretched beyond any recognition said steven m rosenthal a senior fellow at the nonpartisan tax policy center who helped draft tax legislation in the early s 
moreover the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of american tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to mr trump for losing vast amounts of other peoples money  in this case money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in atlantic city 
the reason that trump bent over backward  and potentially broke laws  to avoid paying these taxes is because he was scrambling to stave off financial ruin 
this is the same man who claims he would be a great president because of his successful business background 
yet he calls himself the king of debt his businesses have declared bankruptcy six times he has spent decades paying zero dollars in federal income taxes he lost a billion dollars in a single year running a casino business reporting out tonight even suggests that he has direct financial ties to russia 
all of this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his business background 
even as all of this information is out there american voters still know very little about donald trumps finances because he has refused to be transparent about them 
and consider this what trump is hiding in his tax returns must be much worse than the already damning information that keeps coming out through good reporting if it werent he would have already released them 
the latest new york times story is just the latest installment of trumps shady business background the media should spend the remaining week of this campaign demanding more answers from a man who wants to be in charge of the countrys pocketbook",politicususa.com,Real,english,100.0,92.2978201200483,74,14,2773,473,4.828752642706131,473.0,0.3681475130336877,0.7374756820870908,-0.0544481995336265,-0.0364418377267655,-0.2569591097939523,-0.025696414473911,0.0,0.0714285714285714,0.0,1,0,0.1612593349873946,0.0,-0.9337,0.07,0.095,0.835,Negative,Very Strong

"David Gutierrez, staff writer",herbal tea can help with indigestion and insomnia,"the truth about zika its a grand medical hoax 
monday october   by j d heyes tags zika virus  medical hoax  infectious disease naturalnews one of the most interesting things about the zika virus is that it is not a new ailment it was first discovered in monkeys in  and in humans in  according to a fact sheet from the world health organization while researchers have admittedly probably learned more about the virus since it was first identified some of the health problems now being associated with zika  such as microcephaly in newborns  have never before been seen leaving many to wonder if there isnt some sort of conspiracy being devised by globalists to suit their political agendafor instance according to truthwiki  an investigative site that has recently delved into the history of the disease populations in the past that were heavily infected with zika never reported a single case of a newborn with a shrunken head the current outbreak is far from being the only one in the s outbreaks occurred in oceania and southeast asia and in  the socalled yap epidemic which occurred on the yap main island  part of the caroline island chain in the western pacific  infected threequarters of the population but no cases of newborn birth defects like microcephaly were reported so the current hysteria over microcephaly allegedly being tied to zika appears completely unwarranted will we see another swine flu fiasco with the zika vaccine the same year truthwiki reported using funding that was provided by the bill and melinda gates foundation a genetically altered version of the virus was developed by oxitec oxford insect technologies a british biotechnology company roughly two years later in the fall of  gates helped usher in the first outdoor trials of genetically modified transgenic aedes aegypti mosquitoes which are the species known to transmit the disease they were released ostensibly to fight the spread of mosquitoborne diseases including dengue yellow fever and zika  among others the plan was to get the gm mosquitoes to mate with females to produce offspring that would die soon after birth thereby halting the spread of the disease but truthwiki noted there was another agendain may  the who and the brazilian government colluded to spread propaganda that there were nearly  million suspected cases of zika in brazil and recommended that the deadly poison pyroproxyfen be spread to include areas of drinking water the propaganda disseminated was that since mosquitoes were breeding in those areas of standing water then they too had to be treated with the chemical which was then spread primarily over povertystricken areasthe next thing we know scores of cases involving microcephaly in brazil began cropping up and they were then blamed on zika coincidence many think not whats more there were really only about  children born malformed  not plus as originally reported truthwiki points outas truthwiki notes further zika is a mild viral infection  always has been  and resembles the typical cold or flu most of those afflicted with it suffer a lowgrade fever some pain in their joints a skin rash and conjunctivitis in other cases people have no idea theyve even been infected if symptoms appear at all they may last up to a week but like chicken pox a onetime zika infection can provide lifelong immunity while severe cases of zika may require hospitalization they are rare as are zikarelated deaths overkill and yet despite the virus relatively mild symptoms the us government is set to pay a japanese big pharma firm as much as  million to develop a vaccine  natural news reported recently if thats not overkill then nothing is  especially given the fact that most vaccines contain harmful substances and preservatives another disease outbreak emergency another vaccine with even more harmful chemicals and preservatives will go on the market in fact due to the gravity and dire nature of the zika emergency we may even see mandatory vaccination as we did with the swine flu fiasco in the mids then a mandatory program of vaccination for the illness which only killed one person led to a dramatic spike in guillainbarre syndrome in which the immune system attacks the nerves causing paralysis ironically today the centers for disease control and prevention is claiming that zika may be causing gbspropaganda anyoneread the entire truthwiki report on the zika hoax here  sources",naturalnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,6.250377223837964,49,8,4406,723,5.060857538035961,723.0,-0.396228470543379,-0.3899286096724409,0.3775973367897767,0.3554783597891842,-0.0278943407818004,0.3753867235203498,0.0069156293222683,0.0,0.0027662517289073,0,2,0.0,0.0139632027008235,-0.9986,0.029,0.154,0.817,Negative,Very Strong

How Effective Are Books On Fitness?,comment on why you should become a minimalist by how effective are books on fitness,"home  be the change  government corruption  prominent psychologist says google has power to control elections can shift millions of votes to clinton prominent psychologist says google has power to control elections can shift millions of votes to clinton the free thought project november    comment 
rt  people trust the unbiased internet search giant google so much it can actually influence up to  million undecided voters to choose hillary clinton for president prominent us psychologist and author robert epstein told rt following years of research 
despite being a supporter of the democratic presidential nominee dr epstein believes googles unchecked algorithm of placing one candidate over the other in search results constitutes a threat to democracy 
rt robert how did you discover that google is possibly in cahoots with the clinton campaign 
re well i didnt find out that they were necessarily supporting hillary clinton thats not what i found at first first through several years of research i found that they had the power to control elections the power to shift the votes so that was more than four years of experimental research with more than  people in  countries 
so we established through some very careful experiments that by favoring one candidate in search rankings google can shift a lot of votes more than  percent of undecided voters overall and in some demographic groups up to  percent of undecided voters people trust search rankings so much that if one candidate is favored in search rankings that shifts peoples votes 
now more recently many people have established that google has a very close relationship with hillary clinton that didnt come from my research that came from all kinds of investigative research by many people 
rt are you going to take a look at facebook and twitter as well it looks like social media play an even bigger role in the elections than televised debates 
re well we know now that facebook has the power to shift about  votes to hillary clinton on election day with no one knowing this is occurring all they have to do is send out go out and vote reminders to hillary clintons supporters but not to trumps supporters that would cause a lot of people to vote who would otherwise stay home so yes weve looked at facebook weve looked at twitter but again facebook can shift  votes google can shift somewhere between  and  million votes 
rt have you been able to find abnormal search results by google in some other countries intended to influence the outcome of elections 
re we havent look carefully at too many countries weve looked at the uk election in  we looked at the national election in india at the lok sabha election in  what we do know is that it is the nature of googles algorithm to put one candidate ahead of another that happens automatically that happens as google would say organically so this means that googles algorithm has probably been determining the outcomes of close elections around the world for many years probably actually controlling the winner in as many as  percent of the national elections of the world 
rt what do you think about this threat of big data do you think google and other search engines analyses all search results by an individual for a good purpose 
re well big data at the moment is a threat its a threat to democracy at least as we have it in the united states its a threat to human freedom its a threat to civil liberties this is mainly because the technologies are very new and new means of control of surveillance of manipulation are being developed which at the moment are not regulated  theyre not covered by any laws or regulations so the problem is that these technologies have developed quickly and we have not developed systems for monitoring these technologies weve not developed systems for regulating these technologies obviously we must do so 
rt youve said that unlike europe russia and china were able to overcome the google monopoly but a lot of people are still using this search engine do you think that the us company can manipulate public opinion in russia as well 
re well its hard for them to manipulate opinion if they dont dominate that country google dominates most of the countries in the world the only countries it doesnt dominate are russia and china so russia and china are protected a little bit from google but russia and china have their own problems russia has yandex china has baidu and these companies can use techniques just as the ones that google is using and perhaps theyre already using these techniques these techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides a search engine these techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides search suggestions 
my newest research shows for example that google seems to be favoring hillary clinton in its search suggestions the suggestions it gives you when you first start to type an item and from new research ive done we know that if you suppress negative search suggestions from one candidate that shifts votes and opinions towards that candidate so google is not the only problem any of these big tech companies can use these techniques for surveillance for manipulation for control and i think we have to be concerned about the big tech industries in general around the world not just google 
rt how do you oppose such great power being wielded by one corporation like google 
re well the problem with a lot of power being in the hands of one company is that the private company is not answerable to the public the private company does not have people who we voted on the private company might be run almost like a monarchy with the ceo having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do even not having access to their internal records so we would have no idea of exactly what theyre doing or how theyre doing it and how theyre making decisions this is potentially very dangerous the situation right now is unprecedented in human history there has never been so much power placed in the hands of so few people who are beyond the reach of any laws beyond the reach of any regulations and who dont necessarily have the public interest in mind 
rt what about donald trump in your opinion what methods and tricks has donald trump and his loyal media used in this presidential race 
re well ive said in writing repeatedly and in many interviews that im a very strong supporter of hillary clinton hillary clinton is by far the better candidate donald trump is a very weak candidate he would not make a good leader he would not make a good president plus i know people in his family it makes no sense to me that he is even running for president i dont think he wants to be president i think he just wants to increase his celebrity so that he can start his own television network and i think that steps are now already being taken for him to do that 
the private company might be run almost like a monarchy with the ceo having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do even not having access to their internal records so we would have no idea of exactly what theyre doing or how theyre doing it and how theyre making decisions this is potentially very dangerous 
i made a prediction on twitter recently you can check this i not only have predicted that he will set up his own television network but that he will launch his network with a guaranteed hit show it will be a reality tv show about donald trump running for president and that will be a hit show so i think thats his only interest here hillary clinton will become our next president its guaranteed and in my opinion donald trump has no interest never had any interest in becoming president 
rt do you believe that hillary clinton will become us president through the manipulation of public opinion 
re oh hillary clinton is guaranteed to win this election and i have said previously based on polls that seem to show a kind of a close vote that those polls did not take into account the power that google and other companies have to shift votes thats missing from these polls so once you realize the power that these companies have hillary clinton is absolutely guaranteed to win and she will win in the margin of somewhere between  million and  million votes if we take the mean the average of those two numbers i guess you could say its pretty clear that she will win by approximately  million votes 
rt given that the united states has such an expensive and powerful media industry would you say that voters in the us have a real picture of the presidential campaign 
re well voters in the united states i think do get a pretty good picture because we have so many different kinds of media and people are just bombarded with information from newspapers magazines and the internet more than  different television channels so i think we do get a pretty complex and deep picture of things but you have to remember that all of these forms of media are competitive so were getting one perspective from one magazine another perspective from another magazine 
but when you come to something like google theres no competition theres no competitor its a completely different kind of influence its noncompetitive in other words if youre still trying to make up your mind and you go to google and ask a question about the candidates or about some sort of issue related to the election google will show you whatever it wants to show you and that can easily easily tip your opinion one way or the other and theres no competitor theres no way for anyone to compensate what google just told you 
so this is a completely new and very dangerous kind of influence it has no competition theres no corrective for it and people trust google  we know this from surveys  people trust google more than they trust any newspaper any magazine or any television station people trust information that they get from a computer much more than information theyre getting from television or a newspaper because they know that television and newspapers are biased because they know that people are actually giving them the information but when they get information out of a computer they mistakenly believe that that information is impartial that information is objective and of course thats not really true but thats what people believe",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,82.22642928926737,83,15,10332,1808,4.685840707964601,1808.0,0.6433228671214318,0.9253763973803462,1.9454490503552928,2.056412017008406,-0.3979991739172395,2.1160875424154417,0.0044247787610619,0.0,0.0,0,6,0.0,0.0098904604933527,0.9985,0.115,0.066,0.819,Positive,Very Strong

The Free Thought Project,leaked audio catches clinton redhanded talking about rigging elections,"posted by tim brown 
on monday a man who voted for donald trump was arrested for wearing a tshirt that referenced hillary clinton s comments about trump supporters being  deplorables  to the polls 
brett mauthe  was arrested after he went to the polls wearing a protrump hat and a shirt that read  basket of deplorables  
according to ksat  mauthe removed his hat at the request of those who were overseeing the polls however since the tshirt did not violate the election code he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it 
subsequently he was arrested and charged with electioneering 
ksat  reports  
bulverde police chief gary haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details instead he deferred to comal countys election coordinator cynthia jaqua 
jaqua said the offense of electioneering isnt limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs violations can be committed by voters as well 
it can mean a tshirt a button a hat you know she said anything related to the voting the party the candidate 
jaqua declined to release specific details about mauthes arrest 
jaqua is quoted by my san antonio  
its in the election code electioneering is prohibited within a foot marker you cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons tshirts hats whatever else or carrying signs she said 
most people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail she added 
every election we have to advise people even if its a school bond issue they wear candidates shirts and we just have to remind them please go into the restroom and turn it inside out this is the first time i recall someone getting arrested she said during two decades working at the county election office 
a gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for trump and when i asked him to please take it off he was real nice and took it off she added while working a polling site thursday afternoon in new braunfels 
so according to this nonsense a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day but if a politician makes reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day this is utterly ridiculous 
my question on all of that is what happened to free speech is that recognized as a godgiven right in the first amendment i mean i realize that the constitution is to restrict the federal government but honestly shouldnt the states recognize the right of free speech even in a polling place seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected 
other voters agree with me 
i dont feel like you should be preaching to anybody but i do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate georgina pereida said after casting her vote im kind of shocked because i think thats part of the freedoms that were voting for 
jose tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are  and vote again i ask why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech its not inflammatory it isnt a lie it isnt slander whats illegal about it 
ill tell you politicians want to control people and this is one of many means they use to do that this is what happens when you dont hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose 
mauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media 
the reason im not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around and i dont want to give you any comment he said  
the charged of electioneering is a class c misdemeanor

Game Is A Modern Rite Of Passage That Helps Turn Boys Into Men,comment on  things indian guys have to understand when learning game by game is a modern rite of passage that helps turn boys into men,"how the camp of the saints predicted the migrant destruction of europe how the camp of the saints predicted the migrant destruction of europe 
daryush roosh valizadeh created rok in october  you can visit his blog at rooshvcom or follow him on twitter and facebook rss november   books 
written in  the camp of the saints is a novel by jean raspail that predicted the european migrant crisis forty years before it began not only the actual invasion by brown migrants but also the leftist arguments that enabled it which ushered europe to its doom 
the story follows a onemillion strong flotilla of indians who are slowly making their way to europe the leaders and people of europe have decided not to stop their arrival light on action the book focuses on the mood of the pending arrival particularly how europeans were eager to cuck themselves into oblivion 
after all your helpall the seeds and drugs and technologymigrants found it so much simpler just to say heres my son heres my daughter take them take me take us all to your country and the idea caught on you thought it was fine you encouraged it organized it but now its too big now its out of your hands its a flood a deluge and its out of control  
youve gone and worked up a race problem out of whole cloth right in the heart of the white world just to destroy it thats what youre after you want to destroy our world our whole way of life 
raspail understood how the media whips the public into feeling immense guilt as a mechanism to introduce nonwhite migrants well before the globalist view on migration and equality was elucidated raspail was steps ahead in predicting what the result of it would be as if he was reading into a crystal ball he even knew that migrants would bring diseases like tuberculosis  
and all at once whole sections of new york are deserted a score of american cities watch the flight to the suburbsand half the historic paris pavement tooamerican tots in their integrated schools fall five years behind tubercular gauls flee in droves from our openair clinics  tallyho tallyho just listen to that battering ram smash at the southern gate 
the centurieslong segregation of the first and thirdworld brought great complacency upon europe no one could really get a grasp of what was in store once the thirdworld reached critical mass and started invading the west 
i can tell vilsberg continued that you really dont believe how serious the situation is after all we lived side by side with the third world convinced that our hermetic coexistence our global segregation would last forever what a deadly illusion now we see that the third world is a great unbridled mass obeying only those impulsive urges that well up when millions of hapless wills come together in the grip of despair 
in a bittersweet scene one of the prominent media leftists goes out with his wife to celebrate the arrival of the flotilla with joyous africans towards the end of the party his wife gets brutally raped by them and he eventually dies in sorrow the hordes arrival suddenly awakened all the immigrants already in the country into asserting themselves they began stealing directly from the native citizens by attacking their white privilege 
now its a known fact that racism comes in two forms that practiced by whitesheinous and inexcusable whatever its motivesand that practiced by blacksquite justified whatever its excesses since its merely the expression of a righteous revenge and its up to the whites to be patient and understanding 
what drives the maniacal leftist raspail believes its a suicide mechanism likely activated by a human organism void of spirit and with no reason to endure a cosmopolitan existence attempting to destroy its host culture is an indirect way of killing itself 
whenever the pop tunes would lose their blaring charm there was nothing left but to let oneself drown in the stickysweet syrup of human misery and despair set to music of sorts that one refuge of yearning and unfulfilled souls that had learned nothing else it never occurred to any of them to measure that notion of misery against the past or against their own wellbeing for them it was a drug and they needed to shoot up a good strong dose to keep themselves going like addicts and their heroin the fact that it was often hard to come by close to home made very little difference nothing stops an addict when he has to have his fix and poisons like that are easy to import theres never a lack of pushers besides modern man has always had tucked away in the back of his mind that singular longing for total destruction sole cure for the boredom and anguish that consume him 
the book even predicted a cucked catholic church raspail knew that every institution had to be on board with europes destruction for the thirdworld invasion to proceed seamlessly 
i came south like a lot of other priests father to hail what i thought would be mankinds redemption to welcome the million christs on board those ships who would rise up reborn and signal the dawn of a just new day 
the european women who welcomed the refugees became whores for them if you think this is too extreme consider that european women are getting raped by migrants today but not reporting the crime  yet if a white man so much as brushes past them hes accused of assault  
she died in nice in a whorehouse for hindus disgusted with everything in general and herself in particular at the time each refugee quarter had its stock of white women all free for the taking and perfectly legal  
yes the third world had started to overflow its banks and the west was its sewer 
raspail even predicted the fact that the media would elevant the interracial couplings of white women and the invaders we saw something similar recently when the german government sponsored sex workshops for migrants on how to fornicate with german girls 
ralph ginzburg the famous american publisher had printed a series of photos in his magazine eros which had caused not a little ink to be spilled they showed an interracial couplewhite woman black manin various stages of nude embrace with a caption that read as follows tomorrow these couples will be recognized as the pioneers of an enlightened age in which prejudice will be dead and the only race will be the human race 
the fleet made landfall in france the french impotent to do the right thing to save their country tripped head first into spreading the welcome mat they actually competed with each other to see who would be the most welcoming you can imagine the result when one million wretches made landfall in a country they cared nothing about the new social justice government that rose forth catered to the invaders more than the french similar to what we already see in western european nations 
in war the real enemy is always behind the lines never in front of you never among you always at your back thats something every soldier knows in every army since the world began and plenty of times theyve been tempted to turn their backs on the enemythe socalled enemy that isand give it to the real one once and for all  
when freedom expands to mean freedom of instinct and social destruction then freedom is dead 
the book itself wasnt my style of storytelling raspail made numerous detours and longwinded soliloquies that took away from the action in favor of creating accurate character portrayals its more of a mood novel than one that moved forward at an exciting pace the only flaw is that it didnt predict the rise of an alternative media that would sound the alarm bell even though an active invasion is taking place today the antimigrant side is far stronger than whats portrayed in the book 
the camp of the saints was a prophetic story that showed how the migrants themselves werent the only cause of europes destructionleftists played the largest role in ripping apart the country before their arrival a fact that many of us already know too well nov   roosh valizadeh",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,82.22642928926737,134,25,7951,1389,4.697624190064795,1389.0,2.202649873618648,2.804383550312899,1.3155039052321922,1.3995537659716744,-0.3863700326981192,1.4438722031370608,0.0043196544276457,0.0,0.0007199424046076,0,5,0.0,0.0101912135575303,-0.991,0.125,0.14,0.735,Negative,Very Strong

we have a protester by the way were you paid  to be a thug republican nominee donald trump yelled at a black man from his lectern during a rally wednesday evening in kinston north carolina 
trump went on suggesting that the man had been paid by hillary clinton to protest trump but it turns out as usual trumps paranoia got the best of him and he kicked out his own supporter a man named cj cary who happened to be wearing a gop badge and holding a letter supporting trump but urging him to stop being so offensive 
watch here via raleighs news  observer 
the news and observer reported cary says he wanted to deliver a note to trump urging him to be less offensive and more inclusive to four demographic groups black people women people with disabilities and college students cary an africanamerican says hes an exmarine who also worked in afghanistan as a civilian for the us army 
the irony is no doubt lost on the trump crowd that this man came to urge trump to be more inclusive of african americans and he got called a paid thug and kicked out so the answer to his plea seems to be never gonna happen 
cary was wearing a gop badge and his letter slammed hillary clinton and president obama 
leave it to donald to shrink his own tent even more it wasnt enough that he tossed out a baby now hes going after his few minority supporters

Daniel Greenfield,reminders to ignore the trump is doomed polls,"independents tilt decisively to trump october   daniel greenfield 
independents are the largest political group in the country larger than either democrats or republicans and theyre tilting toward trump and the gop 
adding in ideology the tracking poll shows clinton going from  percent support among liberal democrats early in the tracking poll to  percent now while trumps gone from  percent among conservative republicans to  percent now 
independents  sometimes swing voters in past elections albeit inconsistently  also merit attention theyve gone from a scant  points in clintons favor in the first four nights of tracking  percent to a substantial trump lead now  percent clintontrump 
a key element here is the partisan preferences of independents who emerge as likely to vote they were  points more likely to lean toward the republican party rather than the democratic party at the start of tracking but are  points more apt to do so now 
hillary clinton tried to win over independents by positioning her brand as a moderate centrist who can work with republicans and can get things done while portraying trump as dangerous and irresponsible it certainly worked to a degree 
trumps pitch was that hes not a conventional republican and he can overturn a rigged system the drain the swamp speech was a key element the latter is more likely to ultimately appeal to people who identify as none of the above because theyre disgusted with both parties",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,45,8,1454,234,5.136752136752137,234.0,-0.5185286279157096,-0.3899286096724409,-0.4034182316282799,-0.4111175465520135,0.0470061851182947,-0.4091318943964244,0.0042735042735042,0.0,0.0042735042735042,0,0,0.0,0.0075673614205733,0.4019,0.09,0.063,0.847,Positive,Moderate

trump appoints men who will take america back 
presidentelect donald trumps appointment of bannon flynn and sessions are the first steps in the long and arduous project of taking america back 
trump chief strategist bannon has repeatedly exposed the vicious war on white people on his breitbart website 
national security head flynn realizes that americas foreign policy has been downright traitorous with the support of the radical jihadists of saudi arabia over our natural allies the christian muslim and moderate secularists of syria he also understands that putin of christian russia should not be our enemy but our ally he is an avowed enemy of the jewish warmonger traitors called neocons and they in turn intensely hate this us army general who truly puts america first 
attorney general sessions has been hated for years by the jewishdominated media for his opposition to massive immigration into america and for the fact that he has dared to publicly oppose the massive institutionalized racial discrimination against white people called affirmative action 
during his us senate confirmation hearings senators should demand that he expose the blatant media and political blather of equal rights and opportunity when white people face massive racial discrimination as well as a media hate campaign against the people whose ancestors created america 
we must demand the protection of the civil rights of all americans including white people everyone must be judged on their merit and not the unfair and destructive antiwhite affirmative action racist policies that dominate major corporations federal state and city governments colleges and educational institutions

Mike Smithy,re we are being set up for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash,"republican presidential nominee donald trump has reached a financial accomplishment that no other gop candidate has before
he has amassed the largest smalldonor fundraising pack that has ever been seen in the republican party
zac moffatt an online fundraising expert said that only those most committed to the candidate will typically donate
 
related stories newt gingrich defends donald trump against sexual predator accusations donald trumps star on hollywood walk of fame vandalized independent voters push trump to the front in florida and ohio the people who donate are your core believers said moffatt who was digital director for mitt romneys  campaign
romney and sen john mccain the  gop nominee each raised more overall in their respective campaigns than trump has in total contributions
however trumps campaign has topped both of the former nominees in small individual contributions defined as  or less
 
in this category trump has raised more than  million thus far based on data from the federal election commission
in comparison mccain raised  million and romney raised  million by this point in their election races
while mccain and romney had significant income contributions from other sources trumps smalldonor income makes up  percent of his overall funds
according to opensecretsorg small donations are a key category because for those below  mark the campaigns arent legally required to register personal information on the donor whereas if the donation exceeds  the campaign must give the donors name occupation employer and zip code

we have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political events mnuchin continued unlike democratic nominee hillary clinton who has been fundraising and not out and about he has constantly been out and about

Kelen M,monopoly banks then media now voting machine companies,"who cancer agency under fire for withholding carcinogenic glyphosate documents iarc urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its  weedkiller glyphosate review rtcom  october   comments 
the international agency for research on cancer iarc facing criticism over its classification of carcinogens has reportedly been advising its scientific experts not to publish internal research data on its  report on probably carcinogenic glyphosate 
the iarc urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its  weedkiller glyphosate review according to reuters the agency told reuters on tuesday that it tried to protect the study from external interference as well as protect its intellectual rights since it was the sole owner of such materials 
the scientists had been asked earlier to release all the documentation on the  report under us freedom of information laws 
the groundbreaking review published in march  by the iarc  a semiautonomous agency of the world health organization who  labeled the glyphosate herbicide as probably carcinogenic to humans glyphosate is a key ingredient of monsantos flagship weedkiller wellknown under the trade name roundup it is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world and is designed to go along with geneticallymodified roundup ready crops also produced by monsanto 
the iarcs report caused problems for both the notorious agrochemical giant and the agency itself 
the report sparked a heated debate around the use of roundup and caused several eu countries  including france sweden and the netherlands  to object to the renewal of the glyphosates eu license the vote on prolonging the glyphosate license for  years failed several times in june  but the license was temporarily extended for  months during last hours before its expiration 
the controversial report has seemingly made the iarc a target for attacks from multiple directions and raised scientific legal and financial questions 
various critics including those in the chemical industry said the iarcs evaluations are fuel for unnecessary health scares since the iarc allegedly studies the potentially harmful substance itself and not a typical human exposure to it it remained unclear whether the critics urged a who body to test the potentially carcinogenic chemical on humans 
the critics also brought up other controversial statements from the iarc over whether such things as mobile phones coffee red meat and processed meat could cause cancer 
the agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and widely respected for their scientific rigor standardized and transparent process andfreedom from conflicts of interest numerous freedom of information requests by the energy  environment legal institute ee legal a us conservative advocacy group have since been turned down with this reasoning 
ee legal told reuters that it is pushing a legal challenge over whether the documents in question belong to the iarc or to the us federal and state institutions where some of the experts work basically its being decided whether the iarc as part of the who is truly independent and free from conflicts of interest 
according to reuters officials from the us national institutes of health nih will be questioned by a congressional committee about why american taxpayers fund the cancer agency which faces much criticism over its allegedly faulty classification of carcinogens 
iarcs standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic and therefore cancercausing appear inconsistent with other scientific research and have generated much controversy and alarm a letter from us oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz to nih director francis collins states as quoted by reuters 
the oversight committee demanded a full disclosure of nih funding of the iarc and even money spent in relation to the cancer agencys activities 
iarc opponents from scientific circles vowed to provide their data on the matter the european food safety authority efsa which believes glyphosate is unlikely pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans promised to release its raw data on the subject as part of its commitment to open risk assessment the food safety watchdog made this statement in late september and still has to deliver the promised information newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,6.250377223837964,54,8,4401,675,5.474074074074074,675.0,-0.2433532738279656,-0.3899286096724409,0.3762744784421851,0.2802296818661218,0.3799098558727581,0.2983787610254517,0.0029629629629629,0.0,0.0014814814814814,0,0,0.0,0.0048605022563077,-0.8689,0.097,0.103,0.799,Negative,Very Strong

-NO AUTHOR-,young patient,"print fairfax county virginia voter jena jones told wnd and radio america she found this democrat insert included with her absentee ballot among others 
democratic party officials in fairfax county virginia are categorically denying that prodemocrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the fairfax county democratic committee or fcdc 
earlier this week jena and david jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot see images of the materials jena and david say they found at the end of this article also included are two images from democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters 
i found a letter from the governor of virginia asking me to please vote democrat and help keep virginia blue this year jena explained then i got a letter from the fairfax county democratic committee giving me a stepbystep yesandno what i should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot 
in recent days at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots 
after the report was first published and shared on facebook by david jones fairfax county democratic committee executive director frank anderson replied to davids post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained 
these materials were not sent in the same envelope as the ballot the ballot is mailed separately by the office of elections political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots the two envelopes arrived at the same time commented anderson 
that triggered a quick backandforth between david jones and anderson 
i hate to tell you but youre wrong all items came in one envelope jones said 
like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network 
impossible that letter came out of my office we never have access to other peoples ballots replied anderson 
then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to your letters said jones who should i believe you or my lying eyes 
anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot and mailings are sent to those voters to promote democratic party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives 
i am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed we are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots you can believe what you want to believe concluded anderson 
the virginia department of elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response but after seeing reports from wnd and radio america anderson protested the premise of the story 
please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim stated anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the jones account could not be accurate 
he shared a photo sent by state sen scott surovell showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing democratic party advocacy 
in a formal interview fcdc communications adviser bruce neilson told wnd and radio america the jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true 
its not possible said neilson who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local democrats 
voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen he said the activity of voting is also a public record the fairfax county democratic committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot we get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed 
the same day the ballot is mailed our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the fairfax county democratic committee knows to be democratic positions on the ballot said neilson noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax 
listen to the wndradio america interview with bruce neilson 
however he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself 
that material is mailed in a separate envelope labeled with our initials  fcdc  and our return address in fairfax virginia and would be received either the same day perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government neilson said 
its a separate mailing its a separate stamp its a separate envelope its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes he said 
jones is standing by her story  percent as is her husband david says its a very clear memory 
jena opened the envelope that contained her ballot the green sample ballot the twosided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature there was also the return envelope which i signed david said 
the coverage of jenas story has also elicited similar stories from two other fairfax county voters both of them commented on reddit 
i can confirm this i live in herndon va fairfax county and also received these materials in my absentee ballot i thought it was fishy at the time but didnt look into it stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename

another under the reddit handle nightingalenights said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones david and jena shared last week 
neilson said there is no way the county government which sends out the ballots could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot 
they dont have our materials he said our materials are printed for us by our printer and we have complete control over our materials in our office and they come from our office in our mailing they dont go anywhere else 
its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan democratic materials its never happened before im not aware of it happening now and i dont think that it would happen anywhere in the future neilson said 
there are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in fairfax county leading david jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible he accepts the explanation that the fairfax county democratic committee is not responsible for what he and jena discovered with her ballot 
i understand franks comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots i believe that jones said i think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material i dont see how franks office could be held accountable for whats in the ballot envelope but it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues 
neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true 
i just cant imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail neilson said 
he also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight 
i am an election official on election day i serve in a nonpartisan capacity for our county election office nielson said i can assure you you have democrats and republicans working in the office you have plenty of oversight of the voting process and theres no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot there is no way that happened

EdJenner,you can smell hillarys fear,"the president and hillary clinton share a stubborn desire to avoid scrutiny november   lloyd billingsley 
the president of the united states the most powerful man in the world is working three shifts for his designated successor former first lady and secretary of state hillary clinton as the fbi continues its investigations and clinton emails continue to emerge it is worth recalling the mysteries in the presidents narrative 
last year obamas narrator as the new york times called david axelrod released his massive believer  my forty years in politics  the author recalls a perfectly timed and unexpected call that would change his life 
david its barack said the voice on the phone im thinking about what i want to do next and was wondering if we could talk this call took place in  which explains the perfect timing 
on february   the presidents maternal grandfather stanley dunham passed away at  so gramps as the narrator called him was no longer around to offer insights on family history correct any accounts that might appear or write one of his own 
in the  dreams from my father gramps might say that a kenyan foreign student looks a lot like nat king cole actually gramps might not the kenyan student barack h obama bears little resemblance to cole who passed away in  but enjoyed a revival in the s through daughter natalies unforgettable album 
the narrator of dreams from my father invokes a stubborn desire to protect myself from scrutiny and he doesnt fault people their suspicions if they fail to take him at face value his elusive father is a prop in someone elses narrative and an image i could alter on a whim or ignore when convenient the narrative itself is a myth a tale and a useful fiction 
dreams from my father has no photo section no index and key characters get only a first name these include frank who gets  words back in  the president himself identified this person as frank marshall davis the stalinist paul kengor regards as the presidents mentor as he explained in the communist the untold story of frank marshall davis  
in dreams from my real father  documentarian joel gilbert made a case that davis is the presidents biological father malik obama son of the kenyan barack h obama sees a strong physical resemblance  that also holds true on the policy side professor kengor found remarkable similarities between the writings of davis and the policies of president barack obama 
the kenyan barack obama though a man of the left was not a prosoviet communist had he been prosoviet he would have attended patrice lumumba university in moscow indeed obama warned his fellow kenyans about soviet meddling in africa 
the kenyan obama would have found strange the presidents  cancelation of missile defense for european allies an outspoken man he would not have supported the kind of hightech harassment sharyl attkisson described in stonewalled my fight for truth against the forces of obstruction intimidation and harassment in obamas washington  
the kenyan barack h obama had issues with strongman types such as jomo kenyatta who ruled kenya from  until his death in  in keeping with his country and most of africa the kenyan barack obama is not on record as a supporter of homosexual causes frank marshall davis on the other hand was certainly on board as davis wrote in his  memoir livin the blues  
during the dramatic civil rights demonstrations of the s i often thought we ought to form a united front with joint sitins at cafes in my mind i envisioned the result an indignant white restaurant manager frantically phoning the police get here in a hurry we got niggers at our counters and our washrooms are loaded with fairies and lesbians or perhaps there might have been a joint march on washington waving banners blacks and homos arise 
that and davis pornographic novel sex rebel black  might explain the presidents stubborn desire to protect himself from scrutiny it could also have something do with what the narrator calls the less flattering aspects of my fathers character 
in dreams from my father  the kenyan is raised a muslim but in the audacity of hope he is a confirmed atheist thinking religion to be so much superstition like the mumbojumbo of witch doctors that he had witnessed in the kenyan villages of his youth 
in audacity  the narrator explains that he went to a predominantly muslim school in indonesia he does not indicate whether atheists lutherans jews or buddhists also attended the school registration records were supposedly destroyed by flooding 
the predominantly muslim school also emerges in believer  but axelrod does not indicate if students of other faiths attended frank ann dunham stanley dunham and even the kenyan barack obama are missing from this account but it proves enlightening in other ways 
in a  brian williams of msnbc asked presidential candidates what steps they would take in the event of a simultaneous terror attack on major american cities as axelrod explains obama neglected to include that he would pursue the perpetrators 
hillary clinton did likewise in  passing off what she privately regarded as a terrorist attack on the us compound in benghazi as a spontaneous protest over a video like the president clinton has always shown a stubborn desire to protect herself from scrutiny with bleachbit  hammers and lies hillary and her handlers did their best to make more than  emails disappear 
the contents remain something of a mystery just as mysteries linger about the president and his background on the other hand by now some things are perfectly clear 
the potus and former flotus both decline to identify islamic terrorism both are shrinkwrapped in statist superstition and both lie with the greatest of ease on these counts like the critters in orwells animal farm one can find it impossible to say which was which

No Author,re communism fascism nazism marxism all created by the vatican not jews,why so few whistleblowers a former cia agents story  on today at  am  kevin shipp is a major whistleblower coming from a solid background as a courageous decorated cia officer and anti terrorism expert he held several high level positions in the cia a  new york times article describes the shocking details of shipps harrowing personal story of seeking justice and eventually turning whistleblower after his health and the health of his family were severely compromisedrunning into the juggernaut faced by so many whistleblowers shipp ended up with both his marriage and his career destroyed yet in the end shipp prevailed and managed to stay out of jail he now speaks openly about both his own personal experiences and how the system works to silence and punish whistleblowers and in so doing keep corruption and illegal activities at all levels covered upshipps excellent essay below explains in detail why so few whistleblowers have come out on highly illegal activities related to pentagon corruption cia manipulation and overthrow of governments  shenanigans secret mind control programs and much more his words show just how much courage it takes for people like edward snowden and julian assange to expose major government corruption by spreading the word and calling for clear strong laws to protect whistleblowers we can make a differencewith best wishes for a transformed worldfred burks for peers and wanttoknowinfoformer white house interpreter and whistleblowersilencing whistleblowersby kevin shippwhy dont more whistleblowers come out to expose illegal or unconstitutional secret government operations if these activities are so illegal why are people not coming forward to report themover the last fifty years us government intelligence agencies have perfected a complex sequential system to systematically silence or destroy any employee including his or her family who attempts to reveal illegal or unconstitutional activities conducted as part of secret government operationsas a condition of employment military and intelligence employees recruited for secret operations are required to sign a secrecy agreement or nondisclosure agreement before being given access to the position which offers high pay and status in the organization this agreement threatens civil and criminal penalties if the employee reveals any information regarding the program thinking the agreement will only be used for legal purposes and will get them the coveted job all employees eagerly sign itthis secrecy agreement was originally designed to protect legitimate classified information to protect military personnel during wartime and protect legitimate national defense information and technologyhowever because of the binding power of the agreement government agencies began using it as a powerful tool to silence federal employees who question the legality of certain government operations it was the perfect tool to threaten silence or jail any whistle blower who dared to challenge the secret operations of governmenttoday the secrecy agreement is routinely used as an efficient weapon to intimidate or silence employees annual refresher briefings are given to remind employees of the penalties for violating the agreement these penalties include huge fines termination financial ruin and even prison  all of which mean the destruction of their lives and their families most will not reveal any wrongdoing no matter how egregious for fear of calculated severe retributionwhen employees sign the secrecy agreement and are cleared for classified programs they are not told they are giving up their right to a jury trial or to sue the agency that hired them if they try to do so as a whistle blower they find they have no right to be heard in federal court many have found this out when their case was denied then it was too late that is part of the systemif the employee attempts to contact their congressman or senator their representative is blocked from receiving any information about their case because they do not have the necessary clearancewhen the employee attempts to blow the whistle to the congressional intelligence committees their response is ignored it is made clear to committee members that they are not to touch such cases so they refer them back to their senator or congressman who cannot access information involved in their caseif a courageous employee continues to proceed and blow the whistle a system of personal and career destruction follows this begins with promotions being denied being turned down for sensitive or career enhancing assignments and their files being flagged ruining their reputation inside their agency at this point their career is over if they go quietly the retribution stopswhen the employee still continues their effort to report the information their travel records personnel records medical records and security records are searched for mistakes or damaging information that can be used to threaten them with termination their telephones and computers are monitored searching for incriminating information if no substantive information can be found it is fabricated and placed in their fileemployees who refuse to back down are then subjected to internal security investigations multiple hostile interviews attempting to get them to recant their information and multiple polygraph interrogationsin many cases the employee is commanded to report to the internal medical office for psychological evaluation if they comply the evaluation labels them as paranoid unstable or disgruntled this information is placed in their file and is used later to justify the agencys action in the event of outside scrutinyif the employee contacts a member of the news media they are immediately cited with violating their secrecy agreement and criminal penalties are filed against them several news media outlets are connected to the cia and nsa and notify them of the employees contactfinally the employee is forced to resign after being threatened with termination in kangaroo court meetings where the information fabricated in their files is used against themafter termination or forced resignation interest rates on their internal credit union loans are raised to make the payments unaffordable the release of the employees retirement funds needed provide for their family are blocked a felony the agency black lists them from gaining employment with other government agencies or contractors further ruining them financiallydehumanized financially ruined and under severe emotional and mental pressure the employees family begins to break apart if the familys foundation is not strong this results in alcoholism depression and divorce in some cases it has resulted in the employee committing suicide the ultimate goal of the program of destruction this silences the employee permanently obscuring the agencys role in their destruction it is the perfect crimeshould the employee still have the resolve to endure this program of career and personal destruction and continues to press for release of the information or if his family members attempt to sue the agency for the illegal activity classified agencies will invoke the secretive state secrets privilege which orders the employee and his family not to reveal the information or face prison if the familys case reaches federal court the state secrets privilege is invoked and the case is shut down  and sealed federal judges rubber stamp the censoring of the case without reviewing the case factsnow that the employees case and in some cases their familys case is shut down and under seal citing national security the process of silencing the employee is complete many are never heard from again fearing prison if they talk to anyone including an attorneyusing attractive awards of multimillion dollar contracts the us government military industrial complex convinces private corporations that their employees must be cleared and sign secrecy agreements this includes employees at all levels from secretaries to ceos once they have signed the secrecy agreement they are bound to keep all information including potentially illegal information quiet being threatened with the same penaltiesto date over five million americans have been required to sign this secrecy agreement and now fall under the shadow of the state secrets privilegeonly a few federal employees have made it through this systematic process of destruction to reveal what they know about the illegal operation they observed sadly some whistle blowers have died mysterious deaths or committed suicideemployees in intelligence agencies are aware of penalties contained in the secrecy agreement and the huge risk in violating it even to expose corruption most look the other way to protect their careers retirements and families many have observed the outward signs of the system of personal and career destruction used on others and a culture of fear exists but they are not fully aware of all that is being done the full scope of the system is only known at the higher levels of the organization and is hidden from employees until its use is necessarythis is why we do not see whistle blowers coming out and reporting what they have seen this system has been used and perfected for over fifty years it is being used because it worksit works unless the system is exposed the whistle blower knows what is coming and prepares for it and they are supported by private organizations and individuals dedicated to truth in governmentthis support is essential not only to protect the whistle blower and their family but also to defend our

a massive explosion of a gas pipeline in shelby county alabama  near the site where the same pipeline leaked some  gallons of gasoline just last month  evidences the exact reason activists and native american water protectors oppose the construction of the dakota access pipeline over  miles to the northwest 
one person was killed and at least five people were injured in the blast  tentatively described as an accident  as colonial pipeline shut down operations black smoke billowed sending millions into a panic over the abrupt and unexpected coming gas shortage 
our deepest condolences go out tonight to the family and friends of the person who was lost today and our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured colonial said in a statement reported nbc news  
cited by the chicago tribune  alabama governor robert bentley said the explosion occurred roughly a mile west of last months rupture adding of the likely crippling shortage of fuel well just hope and pray for the best 
it appears to have been an accident and theyre allowing fuel to burn bentley told wbrc  its about one mile west of where the repair took place on the colonial pipeline just recently liveon  brianpia reports on colonial pipeline company history after todays explosion in shelby county httpstcojjmncsce pictwittercomyntwos 
 abc  news abc october   
refined gas poured from the pipeline as workers rushed to construct a footlong earthen dam to contain the flaming spill where fuel will then be allowed to burn itself out dry tinder from an ongoing drought in the area quickly ignited two wildfires after the explosion  which then charred  acres  and area residents were forced to evacuate without any indication when they would be permitted to return 
theres a large plume of smoke theres a large fire noted shelby county sheriffs captain jeff hartley as quoted by the chicago tribune  were not sure exactly how it started or what caused it he said adding of the massive deployment of fire and emergency personnel weve got first responders entering the area and a lot of them 
apart from the worker killed subsequent reports downplayed the extent of injuries suffered by those at the blast site alcom reported seven of the eight or nine subcontractors working in the area had suffered severe burns from the explosion according to shelby county sheriff john samaniego two of those workers  all of whom had begun digging in an effort to flush one of the lines as repairs continued on the original leak  may still be missing  though that information was both unconfirmed and unclear because extreme heat from flames emanating at the site of the explosion prevented further assessment 
colonial noted in a brief statement cited by a local abc affiliate that both pipelines  one transporting gasoline the other distillates had been shut down and further 
colonials top priorities are the health and safety of the work crew on site and protection of the public 
according to a later report from reuters  the fire had been contained by around  pm local time  yet no further word about the possiblymissing subcontractors has been provided incredible video of the colonial pipeline leak from ryan burtis our thoughts  prayers to all pictwittercomnuodoawo 
 wbrc fox news wbrcnews october   
fears of yet another gas shortage akin to that from the september leak  as well as consequent soaring prices  spawned lengthy lines at gas stations as soon as news of the explosion hit headlines reuters explains 
colonial the biggest refined products system in the united states is responsible for supplying about onethird of the  million barrels per day of gasoline consumed on the east coast according to us energy department data 
further it was not clear whether the explosion happened on the gasoline or the distillates pipeline the governor said in the briefing 
although the aforementioned details handily summarize the facts of the explosion  occurring during active repairs of the previous sizeable leak  the facts do little to quantify potential environmental and health impacts of an explosion and leak of this magnitude 
this explosion of a major pipeline supplying fuel to large portions of the southeast and east coast serves an ominous portent for ongoing opposition to construction of the hotly contentious dakota access pipeline slated to cross four states traversing just north of the standing rock sioux reservation in north dakota 
standing rock sioux water protectors and native americans and indigenous peoples from over  nations and their supporters fear that pipelines route  undercutting the missouri river in several places  threatens to poison the tribal water supply and that of no less than  million others living downstream indeed the colonial pipelines tragic mishap  the second in essentially the same section of pipe in about one month  darkly parallels the hundreds of similar accidents such pipelines are prone to 
residents of bismarck aware of big oils horrendous safety record managed to thwart energy transfer partners original plans for the pipeline to be routed near the city  so etp with assistance from the state diverted dakota access to cross just north of the standing rock sioux reservation on privatelyowned land 
rightly viewed by pipeline opponents as blatant exploitation of native americans  as well as a violation of an  treaty with the us government  standing rock sioux water protectors and supporters have camped along the missouri for months in an effort to halt construction as a lawsuit languishes in federal court 
big oil big banks  and government backers obviously view future profiteering from the pipeline important enough to send in absurdly militarized police from at least five states to combat pipeline opponents  who have remained on the whole peaceful prayerful and unarmed 
etp insists the opposition is misguided and dakota access offers a safe alternative to the riskier oil transportation methods of railroad and tanker truck  but even the companys own records listing thousands of spills in just the last six years flatly dispute such claims worse although pipeline leaks and spills might technically be less frequent than those caused by railroad accidents the international energy agency notes pipeline mishaps leaked three times more crude over an eightyear period 
in fact big oils general safety record is nearly impossible to fully track in part because such spills leaks explosions and other accidents are startlingly common and no less perilous to workers residents the environment  and yes the rapidly dwindling water supply 
a report by the center for effective government attempting to map and quantify crude and other industry spills found not only are ruptures and leaks a daily occurrence but eighty people have died and  have been injured in such incidents in the last five years 
since  over  incidents of crude oil and liquefied natural gas leaks or ruptures have occurred on us pipelines these incidents have killed  people injured  more and cost  billion in damages they also released toxic polluting chemicals in local soil waterways and air 
according to the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration as noted in the report  those spills and ruptures sent  million gallons of crude into the environment further illustrating the imperative to oppose construction of dakota access one of the worst spills occurred in north dakota  not by human error or poor maintenance  but when lightning struck a crude oil pipeline spilling  gallons of crude into a wheat field in  
while the oil and gas industry and its wealthy proponents in government would attempt to pull the wool over the publics eyes about pipeline safety using crafty language and skewed statistics the truth is no safe manner for transporting oil and gas actually exists 
opposition to the dakota access pipeline simply isnt confined to a native american issue as exploitive as that facet is  but when pipelines traverse pristine lands farm acreage and the rivers and waterways we depend on to sustain us were all at risk 
what scant corporate media coverage of the standing rock sioux tribes stand against big oil does exist has painted the fight as limited in scope but thousands encamped along the pipelines planned route  who face an unusually bitter winter  no less  are in fact taking a stand for every person and every creature who would be devastated in the event of a future oil spill share",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,82.22642928926737,62,12,8706,1402,5.140513552068474,1402.0,0.0012470409166957,0.3616742515005802,1.5152555157185177,1.4199336162425038,0.050718333151067,1.4647285263127623,0.0049928673323823,0.0,0.0014265335235378,0,4,0.0,0.0106700913285437,-0.9987,0.052,0.129,0.819,Negative,Very Strong
Matthew Vadum,democratic panic,"dawn perlmutter 
the war on law enforcement is epidemic every aspect of culture has been infected the antipolice disease is highly contagious and rapidly spreading on social media in memes in movements in popular fast food restaurants at football games on campuses in media and in every aspect of american culture 
an epidemic is defined as the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time colin kaepernick is the typhoid mary of the antipolice epidemic kaepernick refuses to stand while the us national anthem is being performed at the start of nfl games as a protest against alleged racial injustice and police brutality on sept  kaepernick chose to kneel on one knee as his protest gesture instead of just sitting on the bench his explanation for his decision to switch is that it was an attempt to show more respect to former and current us military members as if kneeling is somehow symbolically less offensive than sitting he misinterpreted the meaning of the military expression take a knee which occurs when troops take a pause before continuing their mission similar to hands up dont shoot the antipolice gesture has been imbued with a trendy righteousness regardless of its original meaning the media reverently refers to kaepernicks protest as taking a knee as if it is some kind of sacred act there are no headlines that read kaepernick disses the flag or kaepernick takes a crap on his country just in case his gesture didnt send a clear enough message kaepernick also uses clothing to symbolize his antipolice sympathies he has worn everything from tshirts honoring the militant black panther party to socks that depict police as pigs in addition to numerous other crimes the black panther party was responsible for the murder of at least  officers and originated the expression off the pigs meaning murder police 
like the typhoid infected cook mary mallon kaepernick is rapidly spreading the antipolice pathogen in what has been dubbed the kaepernick effect dozens of nfl and wnba players have knelt sat or raised a fist during the national anthem the disease has also spread to over  high schools  colleges and one middle school in what can only be described as a bizarre symbolic contradiction there were two incidents where women performing the star spangled banner got down on one knee in protest of what they were singing one of the women denasia lawrence not only kneeled while performing the anthem but also opened her jacket to display a black lives matter tshirt exposing miami heat fans to the contagious disorder 
rapid spread is well known for infectious diseases the antipolice disorder also contaminated the navy an unidentified sailor assigned to the naval air technical training center in pensacola florida filmed herself deliberately not standing for the national anthem and posted it on facebook she remained seated and raised a fist during morning colors and then praised colin kaepernick another sailor petty officer nd class janaye ervin an intelligence specialist in the navy reserve stationed at pearl harbor did not stand for the national anthem while in uniform she also posted a statement on facebook saying she was inspired by colin kaepernick the navy acted decisively she lost her security clearance and may be facing jail in response to her actions it is yet to be known if facing real consequences will contribute to curing the virus or accelerating it 
kaepernick is just one carrier of the antipolice disease the source of the infection can be attributed to specific movements such as black lives matter that originated in florida during the trayvon martin protests the disease went airborne in ferguson missouri where it was transmitted to college students professional protesters and journalists who subsequently spread the disorder to towns and cities across the country currently the disease seems to cluster around populations that are susceptible to antipolice propaganda the symptoms are irrationality excessive anger impaired perception anxiety hatred and delusions of oppression acute symptoms include sudden changes in behavior aggression paranoia loss of control and homicidal and suicidal tendencies all indicators are expressed in severe disrespect for law and order 
early symptoms of the antipolice epidemic have been observed in various cultural manifestations of contempt for law enforcement officers antipolice graffiti is a common symptom of the virus writing has escalated from insults such as police are murderers to threats of violence a recent popular indicator is the expression kill cops and related variations such as kill all police save a life kill a cop cops lives dont matter and shoot cops threats are also depicted in images such as guns to officers heads violent antipolice rhetoric has also been seen in protest signs that read all my heroes kill cops put wings on pigs kill cops and cops under control or cops under flowers disturbingly antipolice graffiti protests and tweets increase after officers are murdered signifying that violence against cops is celebrated and glorified

refusing service at a restaurant goes beyond gestures of disrespect law enforcement officers are concerned that instead of simply being denied service that their food will be tampered with for this reason many officers will only eat at restaurants where they can see the food being made this is a legitimate concern on aug   in louisville ky five police officers were denied service at a taco bell when another employee took their orders they overheard a conversation between two employees making the food saying im going to mess with them which resulted in them walking out of the restaurant when officers have to fear what is being put in their food there can be no doubt that the war on police is a fullscale epidemic 
the antipolice infection went viral on social media facebook twitter instagram and other social networks have hundreds of antipolice pages ridiculing disrespecting and threatening officers protests and riots are organized on social media and some users openly advocate and celebrate the killing of police officers the following are examples of popular hashtags ftp fuck the police bluelivesmurder acab all cops are bastards bluelivesdontmatter fuckcops fuckthemall apdk all police dept killer fryemlikebacon blacklivesmatter ferguson milwaukeeuprising and kaepernick

at its most critical stage the antipolice disorder is lethal this is expressed in the dozens of ambushes and killings of police officers in the most acute phase of the disease some of those infected become homicidal and suicidal targeting and killing officers knowing that they will die in the incident a pattern has emerged that clearly demonstrates that attacks on police escalate from protest gestures to acts of vandalism to deadly shootings that inspire further demonstrations in a continual cycle of protest and violence consequently kaepernicks gesture is neither benign nor harmless it is one symptom in a deadly epidemic",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,84.45285857853474,16,2,9020,1452,5.199724517906336,1452.0,-1.405204768865107,-1.5173329014319723,1.5983310199472676,1.4983176557456936,0.1091537495750187,1.5449451539116144,0.0034435261707988,0.5,0.0013774104683195,1,3,1.1288153449117626,0.0075567665153069,-0.9998,0.068,0.213,0.719,Negative,Very Strong

if this doesnt prove whats beautiful about america we dont know what does 
politically sarah goodwin and colleen cassidy agree on almost nothing they vehemently oppose the others candidate of choice and couldnt differ more on the direction our country should be heading in yet as this heatedly divisive election cycle comes to a head these two demonstrated just how powerful a united american people can be when we put our differences aside and work together sarah a trump supporter and colleen a clinton supporter held each others hair back while vomiting out of intense election anxiety 
in a campaign season as contentious as this one you really have to stop and appreciate moments like this 
though sarah and colleen come from opposite ends of the political spectrum you wouldnt know it when looking into the stall at their polling station in cranford nj where they both lowered their heads into the same trash can and took turns holding each others hair back as they retched over the psychological toll this long strenuous elections taken on them no arguing no fingerpointing no namecalling just dual streams of stressinduced upchuck crescendoing in a duet of dryheaving the sight of two people who have been bombarded for months with messages that the other candidate will completely ruin the country as they know it patting one another on the back and encouraging each other to get it all out is all too welcome in an otherwise toxic and polarizing campaign season 
need more proof that its possible for trump and clinton supporters to overcome their shared animosity during this historical moment of anxiety colleen even offered sarah an altoid once theyd both stopped throwing up and cleaned the barf from their shirts further sarah graciously let colleen borrow her eyeliner which had been smudged due to the tears summoned by a panic attack she experienced while in line to vote after checking in to make sure the other was feeling all right one last time each went their separate ways having found rare common ground with their political opposites in the form of sickening anxiety stoked by the intense fear politics and extremist partisan rhetoric deployed in the  election 
yup the spirit of abraham lincoln is alive knitting a torn nation back together

after that they caught some  kids and kneaded them like dough in the bakery dough machine assaf said according to media reports they were put in the dough mixer they were kneaded the oldest one of them was fouryearsold 
isis transported hundreds of girls to the city of douma which has been at the center of the syrian civil war to be slaughtered isis has been systematically killing nonmuslims and the majority of its victims at the time were christian 
assaf said her own son george was killed by the radical militants after he refused to switch to a muslim name 
my son said to me no mother i dont want to die with an identity not my own i prefer to die with the name george assaf said according to the christian post 
assaf added i asked my son then to hide but he refused and said i dont want to hide myself you are the one who taught me to follow what christ said  whoever denies me before man i will also deny before my father who is in heaven

donald trump raised just  million for his presidential campaign committee in the first  days of october about half as much as his democratic rival putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the white house contest new campaign finance reports filed thursday night showed 
the gop presidential nominee had just  million left in his campaign coffers on oct  compared to hillary clintons  million when the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included clintons war chest grew to  million while trumps totaled  million 
trumps total fundraising dropped  in the first  days of october  million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race at a time when trump needs boots on the ground to get out the republican vote his presidential campaign is broke and in debt to the tune of  million there isnt going to be a lastminute ad blitz for trump or a reservation of television time so that the republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day 
the plan for trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies which are good for trumps ego but not effective in getting voters to the polls trump promised to donate  million to his campaign but has only given  million  the billionaire who promised to selffinance has run his presidential campaign into the ground trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in october 
fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes the money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election hillary clinton is having no trouble raising money which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters trumps cash crush points to a depressed base that doesnt expect him to win

lynch and obamas corrupted doj have switched to overtly undermining the fbi investigation of hillary clinton remember those hillary emails that have come up in the weiner investigation 
as of saturday night the fbi had still not gotten approval from the justice department for a warrant that would allow agency officials to read any of the newly discovered abedin emails and therefore are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen 
we do not have a warrant a senior law enforcement official said discussions are under way between the fbi and the justice department as to the best way to move forward 
this is michael isikoff so the spin is an attack on comey though if comey couldnt get lynch to sign off on a warrant the public announcement could very well have been his way of pressuring the doj to do the right thing now that the emails are an election issue the only way to move forward is to allow the fbi to review them 
but the dems and the media are currently attacking comey and the isikoff piece is a typical example rather than tell the truth that the doj is obstructing the hillary investigation its smearing the fbi instead as so many have pointed out imagine if nixon had been a democrat this is the way the media would have covered watergate

part  of  
the following is the testimony i will present pro se without a lawyer representing me to the pennsylvania public utility commissions administrative law court november  and   as a result of my not permitting an ami smart meter to be retrofitted on to my electric service by peco an exelon company that provides electricity and service to the suburban philadelphia where i live 
this testimony addresses most of the health legal and constitutional issues plus the politics involved regarding the unsafe and rfemf cancercausing technology forced on consumers along with threats of no electric service if utility customers refuse an ami smart meter 
there are four parts to the entire testimony that was  pages long plus  pages of exhibits a thru w and other documentation i had in my brief case not presented but as backup if needed that totaled in excess of three to four hundred pages of scientific documentation published research etc 
personally i think after reading the entire testimony which will appear in four parts readers can understand whats involved with unsafe fireprone and rfemfdirty electricityproducing ami smart meters when for decades utilities provided safe nonplastic parts analog meters before the administrative law court at the pa public utility commission philadelphia pa  november     
your honor judge heep and judge pell members of the pa puc peco energy company the exelon legal team and all interested parties 
since today is the rescheduled postponed june   hearing and for which i catherine j frompovich submitted written testimony five days in advance of that previous hearing as per court rules i have decided to revise and include additional testimony interspersed into the previous  pages  pages of testimony and  pages of exhibits a thru q that i submitted via the us postal service and which all parties received i presume 
however in view of the paramount importance plus dire consequences of emfsrfs being forced onto pennsylvania consumers with no optout for personal safety and protection from  nonionizing radiation emitted by ami smart meters microwave technology and my being a fiveyear breast cancer survivor i submit into testimony and evidence that the pa puc and all participating pennsylvania utilities not just peco as in my case must factor in the american with disabilities act amendments which redefine cancer as a disability especially since there are cancercausing effects from emfsrfs about which i submit into the record hundreds of documented scientific evidence as dozens of exhibits per the schedule of exhibits i now introduce plus printed documents i have with me in support of the fourpage bibliography of pertinent published literature regarding electromagnetic radiation cancer  ami smart meters that i also submit into the record as exhibit s  
since the ada amendments act provides for three prongs of what constitutes a disability i am submitting into evidence a printout titled americans with disability act amendments act adaaa pointing out appropriate and applicable sections exhibit a  a twopage printout titled ada amendments redefine cancer as a disability exhibit a  along with a page dossier containing about  published studies regarding breast and other cancers and emfelfrf cancer studies exhibit a  and topping off those documents with a twopage letter dated  august  from the foremost emfrf researchers physicians and academics in the world written to the north carolina utilities commission exhibit a wherein in the third paragraph they state 
smart meters and cell phones occupy similar frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum meaning that cell phone research can apply to smart meter rfr smart meter rfr consists of frequent very intense but very brief pulses throughout the day because smart meter exposure over a  hour period can be very prolonged  pulses can average  times a day  and because there is building evidence that the sharp high intensity pulses are particularly harmful  the cell phone study findings are applicable when discussing adverse health impacts from smart meters 
those five researchers david carpenter md director institute for health and the environment university of albany dr lennart hardell md phd professor department of oncology university hospital orebro sweden dr magda havas bsc phd environmental  resources studies trent university canada dr martha herbert md phd assistant professor of neurology harvard medical school pediatric neurologist and neuroscientist at the massachusetts general hospital boston dr sam milham md mph former chief epidemiologist washington state department of health 
point out in the last sentence of the first paragraph  it is imperative that the north carolina utilities commission be fully aware of the harm that rfr can cause and allow utility customers to opt out of smart meter installation with no penalty 
frompovich respectfully points out and also cautions the pa puc that in not permitting opt outs from ami smart meters in pennsylvania during formulating its ami sm regulations since hb stated ami sms were not to be mandated  it has breached ethical and legal standards regarding unsafe ami sms regarding the rfrs they emit various states have permitted safe electric power usage by granting and implementing ami sms opt outs which the pa puc deliberately refused in formulating its utility regulations regarding ami sms thereby subjecting consumers to unknown adverse health effects which in essence violate the nuremberg code since consumers consent was not required nor asked and their use apparently amounts to an experiment on pecos customers 
again frompovich points to the letter addressed to the ncuc exhibit a at the end of the second paragraph wherein those researchers cite the us ntp june  study conclusion in part stating adds proof to the conclusions from the human health studies that radiofrequency radiation increases risk of cancer  
frompovich further elaborates that cell phone rfr exposure is elective  ie depending upon personal choice use and an individuals ability to turn off cell phones thereby reducing andor avoiding similar frequency microwave bands and rfrs exposures both cell phones and ami sms produce 
however harmful personal bodily rfr exposure has been mandated by pa puc regulationsnot hbact   and therefore is absolutely illegal since act  does not defy nor negate the pennsylvania state constitutions inherent rights of mankind section  but its the commonwealths regulatory agencythe pa pucthat is guilty of nonfulfillment i allege 
all men and women are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty of acquiring possessing and protecting property and reputation  and of pursuing their own happiness  pennsylvania constitution section  
however contrary to that pennsylvania constitutional right is the fact that mandated ami smart meter rfr exposure because of no opt outs in pennsylvania specifically via pa puc regulations not act  literally provides no way to escape andor avoid ami sms microwave rfrs that is illegal and should be prosecuted criminally frompovich contends furthermore the pa puc overstepped its agency powers and frompovich contends is guilty of committing ultra vires during its rulemaking process

the key dispute and multifaceted issue of concern in frompovichs case  being a breast cancer survivor in excess of five years  is her free and legal exercise of legal and constitutional rights to be free of the fear exposure to cancercausing emfs andor actuality of contracting cancer due to ami sm rfr exposures  in her homesomething that the ada amendments act indisputably encompass since once a cancer patient that makes frompovich covered within one of the adaaa prongs for all time and also includes frompovichs indefeasible right to protect property both her home and her personal body and its life processes including her reputation 
that federal adaaa must be factored into frompovichs case since peco has obtained federal grant monies to implement its ami smart meters rollout and the law states that any business that accepts federal grant money is mandated to abide by the adaaa including state regulatory agencies like the pa puc 
frompovichs refusal of an ami sm plus her human and innate right to protect her health body and property are more than confirmed when those five researchers point out  the strongest evidence for hazards coming from rfr is cancer  there is a growing body of evidence that some people develop a condition called electrohypersensitivity ehs see paragraph  of the letter to ncuc exhibit a  
on page  paragraph  of that same letter the researchers further point out a dichotomy in science which is the very fact that independent research versus industry research studies are at coincidental if not predictable  variances as per the chart i raise up and submit into the record  a doublesided poster radiofrequency research does funding matter which shows two pie charts depicting those conflicting statistics 
nonindustry studies indicate  harmful effects with  no effects while industry studies indicate   harmful effects with  no effects statistically thats almost a wash as each just about cancels the other however theres a slight edge of  from nonindustry studies indicating harmful effects more interestingly though is that industry studies did find  harmful effects studiesalmost onethird of the studies and yet the industry concludes differently stating there are none that alone should be a red flag for them or anyone of scientific mind to investigate further and they did not which indicates some sort of collusion of not wanting to know or find out is that a crime of omission or collusion 
paragraph  on page  of that letter exhibit a cites the obvious crux of scientific and ethical issues regarding ami smart meters in pennsylvania in particular stating with a leading nc dhhs staff member admitting that he is not qualified to review the literature and the fact that he relied on industry representatives for assistance the dhhs conclusion is not surprising 
frompovich feels compelled to question how much of that microwave technology industry representative assistance occurred and still occurs with and from peco and the pa puc thereby illegally depriving frompovich and all pennsylvanians of their rights to protect their health and property along with the exercise of redress against what amounts to experimental ami smart meter science whose proponents wantonly do not recognize nonthermal adverse health effects from rfrs which have been known since  i introduce exhibit t electrosensitivity es and electromagnetic hypersensitivity ehs into the record to document that in    and  various health issues have been identified with emf nonthermal exposures 
your honors i respectfully ask the court to instruct peco to produce the experimental studies rather than epidemiological studies indicating no nonthermal effects from emfsrfs wheres the science 
arent pecos customers entitled to have that evidence 
frompovich also feels compelled to ask this court the following how much influence did the microwave industry contribute to pa state representative robert godshalls campaign coffers andor his preferred charities that apparently has enabled godshall as chair of the pa house consumer affairs committee to sit on opt out bills in the pa legislature for several legislative sessions including godshalls verbal proclamations to others that he will never bring opt out bills to the floor for a vote which obviously is an impeachable offence for depriving pennsylvanians of their right to redress government and government agency oppressions that enable utility companies to harass and bully customers about cutting off electric service if they refuse fireprone ami sms in pennsylvania 
heres what other us states have done regarding ami smart meters 
analog meters are definitively offered as the optout meter in four states arizona california maine and texas the nevada public service commission urges the utilities to provide the meter that will have the greatest customer acceptance which clearly is the analog 
three states offer the existing meter as the optout meter an existing meter might or might not be analog georgia hawaii and consumers energy in michigan

André du Pôle,more emotions men should master,"before trumps glorious victory over the forces of progressive darkness i promised that i would provide a roadmap on what traditional men could do next to usher in a return of the patriarchy if hillary had prevailed the roadmap would have been a grim one as all of our work would have had to take place underground happily we will be able to work in the open here are three ways that we can leverage trumps victory to bring back the patriarchy
rule yourself bruce wayne is a good role model for traditional men urbane fit financially independentand dangerous
this may seem obvious but if we are going to bring back the patriarchy we have to be men who are worthy of it a patriarch who relies solely on the fact that he is a man will quickly be overthrown however a man who has authority because he has earned it by the way he lives will naturally retain it thus the first step in making progress under a trump administration is the same as it would have been if hillary had been electedselfimprovement
selfimprovement involves the obvious things getting in shape training martial arts getting rid of addictions and exercising selfdiscipline the process of selfimprovement needs to be undergirded with a philosophy of life for most men this will involve adopting and faithfully living one of the faithtraditions for others it may mean adopting stoic philosophy whatever it is it will have to be more substantial than the degenerate pleasure wealth and power at any cost morality of our spirit cooking eliteslack of morality got us into this problem in the first place
selfimprovement also involves moving in the direction of financial independence under a trump administration this last goal will become easier to achieve trumps tax plan cuts tax rates across the board this will especially benefit men who are in the middle class who are trying to generate more income they will be able to keep their savings so that they can move ahead rather than paying a penalty that keeps them from becoming wealthy
trumps emphasis on fair trade will also result in more american jobs and unleash unprecedented creativity the age of trump will be a great time to start a new business one word of warning is in order though under trump the us is likely to flourish in a way that hasnt happened since the the s enjoy the prosperity but dont get caught back in the materialism merrygoround our goal is a lifetime of financial independence not conspicuous consumption
financial independence is an important practical consideration because you will need a firm financial foundation for the second step which is ruling your family
rule your family be the patriarch
starting with the boomers our society rejected the traditional way of life and adopted progressivism families got smaller divorce became more common promiscuity increased feminism became the default philosophy for girls and the remaining vestiges of the patriarchy vanished progressivism promised freedom but delivered enslavement to political correctness and globalism
a trump administration will do little to reverse the deleterious effects that progressivism has had on the family at best the only thing government can do for the family is encourage it financially and provide a safe environment for it but real change has to come from the bottom upfrom men and women who return to tradition for us that means finding a traditional woman or more likely one who can be converted to tradition getting married and having lots of children a twitter shitlord  johnrandom  drove home this point in a humorous way by suggesting with a fourstep trump bump starter kit




getting married having children and raising them to hold to the patriarchy is the long game but it is the only way we will have long term victory without a next generation of traditional men any ground that we gain under trump will soon be lost
rule societybring back the patriarchy benjamin franklin is a great example of a man who was serious about his civic duty
the next thing that we must do is start reclaiming our institutions trump has captured the presidency and republicans control congress but many of those republicans are cucks who will oppose the trumpian agenda and our other institutions are still dominated by leftists hollywood the news media education and corporations all proclaim the progressive antipatriarchy message if we dont take advantage of the current moment any gains that trump makes will be quickly rolledback after he leaves office
therefore we need to start reengaging with these institutions to shift them towards patriarchal nationalism  you can share any ideas you have to do this in the comments here id like to suggest that one institution that needs our participation the republican party trump has created many allies within the gop but the majority of the party still holds to the cucked ideology of open borders and bad trade deals like nafta the gop desperately needs likeminded men within its ranks who will help trump achieve his vision
getting involved in your local gop is easy you merely have to get in touch with your local party leadership in your district you dont have to run for elected office simply volunteer your time in getting local officials elected voting for delegates or attending gop events go in with a respectful attitude a lot of the local gop leaders are good people who still dont understand that the real battle is against globalists work for incremental change and if you have the disposition required for it consider running for local office yourself
one piece of advice if you do choose to get involved in politics dont get caught up in it one way we ended up with an ossified and outoftouch gop is that people started to hold the globalist neoconservatism with an almost religious fervor the other trap is to use politics as a way of enriching oneself in the manner of hillary clinton if you do choose to enter the political realm resolve at the outset to not use it for your own financial gain dont make politics your life think of it strictly as civic duty
of course politics is not everybodys cup of tea the key is to use your gifts whether that is in moviemaking or in running a company to help create an environment where the patriarchy can flourish
conclusion the one thing we must not do in wake of the trump victory is rest on our laurels if hillary had won wed all have a great sense of urgency to protect what little remained of our way of life now that trump is coming into power the temptation is to relaxto just let trump do it all this temptation must be avoided we must capitalize on the trump victory with the same high level of urgency that we would have regarded a hillary victory if we dont we run the risk of losing all the ground we have gained

Alex Ansary,obama admits to rigged elections back in,"genetically modified crops in us fail to deliver expected yields  
all gov 
the controversy over genetically modified crops has long focused on largely unsubstantiated fears that they are unsafe to eat 
but an extensive examination by the new york times indicates that the debate has missed a more basic problem  genetic modification in the united states and canada has not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides 
the promise of genetic modification was twofold by making crops immune to the effects of weedkillers and inherently resistant to many pests they would grow so robustly that they would become indispensable to feeding the worlds growing population while also requiring fewer applications of sprayed pesticides 
twenty years ago europe largely rejected genetic modification at the same time the united states and canada were embracing it comparing results on the two continents using independent data as well as academic and industry research shows how the technology has fallen short of the promise 
an analysis by the times using un data showed that the united states and canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields when measured against western europe a region with comparably modernized agricultural producers like france and germany  also a recent national academy of sciences report found there was little evidence that the introduction of genetically modified crops in the united states had led to yield gains beyond those seen in conventional crops 
at the same time herbicide use has increased in the united states even as major crops like corn soybeans and cotton have been converted to modified varieties and the united states has fallen behind europes biggest producer france in reducing the overall use of pesticides which includes both herbicides and insecticides 
one measure contained in data from the us geological survey  shows the stark difference in the use of pesticides since gm crops were introduced in the united states two decades ago for crops like corn cotton and soybeans the use of toxins that kill insects and fungi has fallen by a third but the spraying of herbicides which are used in much higher volumes has risen  percent 
by contrast in france use of insecticides and fungicides has fallen  percent and herbicide use has decreased  percent

Nick Denby,no title,"actor jim caviezel portraying jesus in the passion of the christ 
jesus christ of nazareth is not the republican nominee for president in this election cycle 
but if he were democrats would try to destroy him in the same manner theyre attacking the  gop candidate donald trump 
thats according to radio host rush limbaugh who hypothesized what this years race would look like if the son of god were at the top of the republican ticket 
should president trump try to prosecute hillary sign the hottest petition in america now to show your support 
it doesnt matter who the republicans would have nominated they were gonna get the treatment trumps getting it wouldnt have mattered limbaugh said wednesday 
they would go out of their way to find ways to destroy jesus christ if he could be nominated as a republican the democrats would do everything they could include calling him a liar the bible a fake book whatever it took rush limbaugh 
and despite the fact the bible never indicates jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock limbaugh suggested democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of his offspring 
they would scour the historical record looking for children he had fathered anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit jesus thats who they are thats what they would do 
limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that republicans would never escape this kind of media assault based on who we nominate donald trumps rnc acceptance speech photo screenshot from rnc live feed 
i say this because a lot of you never trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like trump no its exactly what you get when you nominate a republican whenever there is any opposition to the democrats this is what they do it doesnt matter theyre gonna do it they did it to romney  
ive made this point til i blue in the face they turned romney who is mildmannered mr gosh cant even get noticed into the biggest walking satan el diablo politics had ever seen at that time and they made it stick so this is why i think trump has so many people supporting him hes fighting back against it when most republicans havent and dont 
as an example of how media treatment of republicans has not changed limbaugh played an excerpt of  electionnight coverage from cbs commentator bill moyers characterized the race before it was known that republican ronald reagan would easily defeat democrat jimmy carter moyers stated 
those of you who might speak spanish who might be black who might be women remember said carter whos been your friend and there under the california sun in san diego at a shopping center ronald reagan was delivering himself of one of those patriotic soliloquies at which hes been a master since his days at eureka college suddenly hecklers in the crowd started shouting and waving their era signs reagan took his cue and snapped back aw shut up 
and thousands of supporters roared their approval those are the people for whom ronald reagan is the apostle of the rollback the knight who promises finally to slay the dragon of liberal government jimmy carter won four years ago as an outsider and if he wins at all tonight it must be as an insider defending the status quo reagan has cast himself as a sheriff who comes riding into town at just in the nick of time shouting enoughs enough 
does it sound like anything has changed in the way these people see the world limbaugh asked not an iota

the united arab emirates a key saudi ally in its deadly aggression against yemen has welcomed a new united nations peace proposal to end the yemen conflict 
the uae supports the efforts of un special envoy for yemen ismail ould cheikh ahmed knowing that the mission of a mediator is always tough minister of state for foreign affairs anwar gargash said on his twitter account on thursday 
the remarks came two days after the un envoy submitted the plan to yemens houthi ansarullah movement and its allies 
according to informed sources the roadmap urges agreement on naming a new vice president after the withdrawal of houthis from the capital sanaa and other cities and their handover of arms to a third party 
the initiative further calls on former yemeni president abd rabbuh mansur hadi to transfer power to the vice president who would appoint a new premier to form a government united nations special envoy for yemen ismail ould cheikh ahmed speaks to reporters at sanaa airport following his visit to the yemeni capital on october   photo by reuters 
the roadmap represents a political solution for the yemeni crisis gargash said adding un efforts represent a chance to bring yemenis back to the political track other alternatives are gloomy 
the hadi administration however said that it had not received any roadmap for a political settlement 
peace talks which were held between yemens opposing parties in kuwait ended in deadlock in august 
earlier this week ahmed made a visit to sanaa where he held meetings with yemens warring sides and called for a return to a cessation of hostilities to allow aid deliveries

Daniel Greenfield,us navy iran giving terrorists missiles to fire at us ships,"hillarys secretary of state after  send a check for  million to iran   
were talking about tehran joe biden of course who is good pals with the iran lobby biden is reportedly hillarys fantasy cabinet pick for secretary of state because the democrats have decided that secretary of state is a job too important to be trusted to experienced diplomats but should instead be reserved strictly as a consolation prize for failed presidential candidates 
heres a flashback on bidens views  
democratic vicepresidential candidate joe biden was quoted monday as telling senior israeli officials behind closed doors that the jewish state will have to reconcile itself to a nuclear iran in the unsourced report army radio also quoted biden as saying that he opposed opening a additional military and diplomatic front army radio said israeli officials expressed amazement over the remarks attributed to him israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of iran army radio quoted biden as telling the unnamed officials 
bidens people loudly denied the report but he had a history of being tight w ith the iran lobby 
some might call it reaching out to american muslims but to many iranians living in california a fundraiser for sen joseph biden ddel at the home of a prominent proiran lobbyist on feb  sent a wrongheaded message to the ruling clerics in tehran 
when we learned that sen biden was planning to hold a fundraiser at the california home of dr sadegh namazikhah we immediately contacted his office to express our dismay a prominent iranianamerican activist tells insight why dismay 
dr namazikhah is wellknown in the los angeles area for his support of the ruling clerical regime in tehran and is one of the regimes leading unofficial lobbyists in america we thought that sen biden might not know his background getting the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee to appear at this event will certainly be seen by the regime in tehran as a show of support 
on the eve of the fundraiser which brought an estimated  into bidens reelection coffers a biden staffer told the activist that the senators staff had all the facts necessary to make a decision and he was planning to attend the fundraiser despite the protests 
several participants who paid to attend the event tell insight that biden arrived at  pm stayed until  and delivered a sweeping condemnation of president george w bushs axis of evil formula 
as senator biden was not only undermining bush but fundraising off it at the home of supporters of a terrorist enemy state 
biden also impressed many of those present with his friendly attitude toward the islamic republic of iran the senator said that iran always wanted to be an ally of the united states and to have good relations with the us according to housang dadgostar a prominent lawyer as iranianamericans we dont want anything to happen to the iranian government or to the iranian people as a result of this war on terrorism says mohsen movaghar a los angeles businessman both men belong to the member board of directors of namazikhahs iranian muslim association of north america iman 
namazikhah denied any official contact with the iranian government but he tells insight that he regularly travels to iran  something many expatriates do  and that he actively supports moderates within the ruling clergy such as iranian president mohammad khatami in their efforts to bring reform to the islamic system 
namazikhah and other iman board members say bidens office contacted them to inquire if they would hold a private fundraiser for the senator who is up for reelection this year after meeting with them at a protehran gala in new york last december that event was sponsored by the americaniranian council aic a proregime lobbying group trying to get congress and the bush administration to lift the trade embargo on iran 
but biden had the perfect post  reaction  
after september th biden suggested sending  million to iran no strings attached as a gesture of good faith to the arab world 
at the tuesdaymorning meeting with committee staffers biden launches into a streamofconsciousness monologue about what his committee should be doing before he finally admits the obvious im groping here then he hits on an idea america needs to show the arab world that were not bent on its destruction

Henry Wolff,illinois senator draws fire for racially charged attack on opponents family,"rancher yearns for trump wall on usmexico border afp october   
to many donald trumps pledge to build a wall along the usmexico border is unrealistic but for jim chilton its the only way hell get a good nights sleep 
the yearold a fifthgeneration rancher on the arizona border with mexico says he has grown weary of seeing drug smugglersrather than just cattleon his ranch and a wall is the answer to his troubles 
i really admire trump for having the insight and the knowledge to know whats wrong with the current border system he said as he surveyed the sprawling desert plains of his squaremile ranch that stretches to the mexican border 
we need a wall ive been saying that for  years    and we need roads along the boundary and the border patrol to be deployed there and not let anybody in he added it would make my life so much better and id feel more secure 
snip 
chilton who admits that trump was not his first choice among the republican candidates for the white house says building a barrier to secure the mile kilometer usmexico frontier not only makes sense but is also a question of national security 
snip 
i live in a nomans land i live in a land that is occupied by the sinaloa drug cartel he sighed pointing to mountains on his ranch where he said scouts equipped with sophisticated equipment are posted as lookouts for smugglers 
i have seen cartel scouts on these two mountains before    and even in my front yard he said i wave at them and they often yell hola and wave back 
chiltonwho keeps a gun holstered on his hip a rifle by his front door and a pistol by his bedsideadded that he and other ranchers are also in favor of beefed up security in remote border areas as extremist groups like islamic state is may be using them to slip operatives into the united states 
snip 
but beyond the drug cartels and threat of terrorism chilton insists that trumps wall is all the more necessary for humanitarian reasons 
its just outrageous for me to find a dead body on my ranch its outrageous for the border patrol to find a dead body and its outrageous for my cowboys he said referring to migrants who often die making the crossing into the us through the brutal desert 
this is as big a humanitarian issue as it is a national security issue 
snip 
according to the us border patrol nearly  bodies have been recovered since  from the desert in the tucson arizona sector which covers  miles of the border

solar power and water desalination are two of the most important things to lock down in the modern age produces an endless source of drinking water and electricity is what we need to guide us through the unknowns of a changing climate  
this is why an incredible project like the pipe needs global attention 
the machine can generate  mwh each year and additionally turn  billion liters or  billion gallons of salt water into drinking water in that time

what results are two products pure drinkable water that is directed into the citys primary water piping grid and clear water with twelve percent salinity the drinking water is piped to shore while the salt water supplies the thermal baths before it is redirected back to the ocean through a smart release system mitigating most of the usual problems associated with returning brine water to the sea",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,85.16960871803,75,11,1819,296,5.077702702702703,296.0,0.3987225523767704,0.1737735362073249,-0.306849572254096,-0.313921337568058,-0.0112698152720064,-0.3096632761738477,0.0101351351351351,0.0,0.0033783783783783,0,0,0.0,0.0164891088083668,0.9558,0.09,0.02,0.889,Positive,Very Strong

No Author,robotic advancements  mars ancient aliens,"we all remember the lies that led the us into the iraq war 
but after years of media indoctrination its easy to forget the other lie that helped rally the country around the illegal invasion of iraq 
john mccain  there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may??and i emphasize may??have come from iraq 
david letterman  oh is that right 
john mccain  if that should be the case thats when some tough decisions are gonna have to be made 
source mccain and the anthrax scare    higher quality clip 
when iraq finally admitted having these weapons in  the quantities were vast less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax a little bit about this amount  this is just about the amount of a teaspoon  less than a teaspoon full of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the united states senate in the fall of  this forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope 
iraq declared  liters of anthrax but unscom estimates that saddam hussein could have produced  liters if concentrated into this dry form this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons and saddam hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoonfull of this deadly material 
source colin powells presentation to the un on iraq wmd    
although it is difficult to remember at this point the anthrax scare of late  was widely seen as a followup to the  attacks and a sign of things to come at the dawn of the socalled war on terror beginning in late september and continuing for several weeks multiple anthraxlaced letters were mailed to various media offices and the offices of two us senators killing five and injuring  
it did not take long however for the neocons in the bush administration to start insinuating that the anthrax scare was tied to their two favourite boogeymen saddam hussein and osama bin laden 
in his book  the  anthrax deception  dr graeme macqueen describes this as the double perpetrator hypothesis an attempt to blame the attacks on both al qaeda and iraq he writes 
what i call the double perpetrator hypothesis held that bin ladens group sent the anthrax spores through the mail but that the group had a state sponsor that had supplied the spores namely iraq 
this hypothesis insinuated by key government officials and parroted by the press had the added benefit of explaining how the anthrax spores used in the attack could have been weaponized so efficiently 
macqueen well the young woman who opened senator daschles mailafghanistan and iraq    
the story of iraqi collusion with al qaeda sounded credible enough to an american public that had no familiarity with the muslim world and was still reeling in shock from the attacks of  the only problem with that story is that it was a complete lie 
when key government scientists came out to denounce the claim that the anthrax contained traces of bentonite a signature of the iraqi anthrax program the bush administration sought to distance itself from any direct connection between saddam and the attacks 
as filmmaker robbie martin explains in his documentary american anthrax  however that connection was reinforced to the public by way of a complicit corporate media 
martin points to disgraced exnew york times journalist and iraqi wmd pusher judy miller as a particularly egregious example of how the media laid the groundwork for the campaign to tie iraq to the anthrax letters 
as we now know of course the anthrax attacks were a false flag event 
by early  it was confirmed that the anthrax had sourced to the us army medical research institute for infectious diseases at fort detrick a key facility within americas own bioweapons program soon suspicion fell on steven hatfill a person of interest identified by the fbi who eventually won a  million lawsuit against the department of justice for falsely accusing him of his participation in the attacks and illegally leaking his identity to the press the blame for the attacks was then pinned on bruce ivins a researcher at fort detrick who conveniently died before the fbi could identify him or try him in court the national academy of sciences and the government accountability office have both cast doubt on the fbis scientific investigation of the attacks however and a whistleblower within the fbis own investigation has revealed that the bureau is sitting on evidence that would exonerate ivins 
whoever the perpetrator may have beeneven accepting that ivins was the attackerit is a fact that the attacks were a false flag using crudely forged letters to convince the american public that they were written by al qaeda agents and that false flag was aided by the government officials and corporate media talking heads who were happy to propagate this false story in the lead up to war in iraq 
the legacy of that war remains with us today the middle east including iraq itself remains in chaos a direct result of the illegal invasion and occupation of that country an invasion and occupation that was sold to the public on the back of brazen lies and outright fabrications 
the blood of a million dead iraqis stains the hands of those who lied the public into that war and those who aided and abetted those liars 
meanwhile the anthrax attacks themselves remain a case study in how a false flag event can be used to whip the public into hysteria and be led into supporting illegal wars of aggression",coasttocoastam.com,Fake,english,6.9746300516358035,47.88118811881188,41,5,5505,938,4.8,312.6666666666667,-0.6408287852880403,-0.9536307555522068,0.6683616015904014,0.6925297296529009,-0.2853351483544899,-0.2829244003075636,0.0053304904051172,0.0,0.0010660980810234,0,2,0.0,0.0089750839543862,-0.9996,0.049,0.205,0.746,Negative,Very Strong
RT,assange claims crazed clinton campaign tried to hack wikileaks,"abc poll oversamples dems by  claims hillary leading mainstream media oversampling democrats to create fake hillary lead kit daniels  october   comments 
in another example of poll rigging an abc presidential poll surveyed  more democrats than republicans and showed hillary clinton leading by   with a  sampling error 
abc claims its a point race with clinton ahead after polling a random national sample of  likely voters but the polls methodology reveals the poll was heavily biased in favor of hillary 
results have a margin of sampling error of  points including the design effect partisan divisions are  percent democratsrepublicansindependents abc said near the bottom of the poll 
of course hillary will be ahead in polls dominated by democrats but abc and other mainstream media outlets are betting that voters wont bother to look at a polls methodology to find the bias 
even if theres more registered democrats than republicans nationally they dont outnumber them by nearly  because otherwise republicans wouldnt be winning national races 
these kind of misleading polls really strike at their credibility as pollsters wrote media analyst aaron rossiter they seem to want the big hillary lead probably to throw off the poll averages and suppress republican voter turnout 
and if the fact that mainstream polls are adjusted to manufacture a hillary lead still sounds doubtful to you just read this leaked email from democratic consultant tom matzzie 
i also want to get your atlas folks to recommend oversamples for our polling before we start in february by market regions etc i want to get this all compiled into one set of recommendations so we can maximize what we get out of our media polling 
the email also includes this report from the atlas project on how to rig polls to get the desired result

Kit Daniels,podesta who told hillary she could use private email,"three quarters of americans oppose gun control record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban steve watson  infowarscom  october   comments 
a new poll released by gallup has found that a record amount of americans are opposed to gun control measures  
the survey found that  percent of respondents over three quarters believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law 
the findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades 
the poll also found that almost two thirds  percent are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them 
that figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue  years ago 
just  percent less than a third say they support a ban on handgun ownership while only  percent support a semiautomatic ban an eightpoint decline on previous findings 
in addition gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end 
in a summary of the new poll gallup seemed surprised by the findings describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox 
perhaps paradoxically opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles these guns were used in highprofile incidents including the terrorist attacks in san bernardino california and orlando and the mass shootings in aurora colorado and newtown connecticut 
the findings reveal just how out of step hillary clintons position on gun control is with the majority of americans 
hillary is a staunch gun control proponent wikileaks releases have revealed that hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order

us republican vice presidential candidate mike pence says the mainstream media is biased against donald trump and there are many instances of voter fraud in the run up to the november  election 
republican presidential nominee trump has recently intensified his criticism of the american electoral system he calls the election process rigged and says the media is colluding with democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton in order to win the white house 
he has questioned the legitimacy of the us elections saying that he believed the vote was already being rigged at many polling places 
during his final presidential debate with clinton last week trump declared that he might not accept the results of the november  presidential election if there is evidence it was rigged 
in an interview with cbs news on friday trumps running mate pence said make no mistake about it there are many instances in our lifetimes of voter fraud in individual polling places and in certain jurisdictions 
donald trump and i are just calling on people to respectfully participate in the electoral process we want a victory on election day but we also want it to be a victory for american democracy he stated donald trump speaks at an event on october   in portsmouth new hampshire photo by afp 
the governor of indiana rejected claims of critics that trumps rigging rhetoric may encourage violence by his supporters if he loses the presidential election 
we certainly would denounce any calls for anything other people being vigorously involved in the electoral process he said 
i have to tell you i really dont see it the people that rallying around our team rallying around our cause love this country are passionate about this country and are anxious to see change the gop vice presidential nominee stated 
he went on to accuse the media of unfairly backing clinton 
the level of negative coverage about my running mate in many quarters in the national media has just been overwhelming compared to any negative coverage or frankly the avalanche of scandals coming out of hillary clintons years as secretary of state pence said attendees stand during the national anthem at a rally for republican presidential candidate donald trump at cross insurance center on october   in bangor maine photo by afp 
according to a recent poll released  percent of american voters are saying the  election could be stolen from trump due to widespread voter fraud 
and  percent of republican voters think the election could be stolen from the billionaire businessman while  percent of democrats agree with the prospect of rigging

EdJenner,obama doj handmaiden of clinton corruption,"fbi wiretapped corruption suspect discussing clinton deals november   daniel greenfield 
if youre wondering why team hillary panicked and unleashed hell on the fbi this may be another ingredient in the stew the wall street journal article is clearly trying to spin things to the left and damage the credibility of the fbi but its an interesting data point  
the fbi had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a publiccorruption case talking about alleged deals the clintons made these people said the agents listening to the recordings couldnt tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate but it was they thought worth checking out 
prosecutors thought the talk was hearsay and a weak basis to warrant aggressive tactics like presenting evidence to a grand jury because the person who was secretly recorded wasnt inside the clinton foundation 
fbi investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors and some executives at the bureau itself to keep pursuing the case 
as prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly those justice department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly 
in short fbi people had material for a case that the government didnt want brought because team obama were hillary backers and the senior leadership in the doj saw their careers linked to the rise of hillary and so a stand down order was handed down 
following the february meeting officials at justice department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to stand down a person familiar with the matter said 
this is what happens when the doj has been so thoroughly corrupted from the top down 
meanwhile theres little doubt considering what we already know that the doj people had been updating hillarys people on the fbi investigation should those emails come out they will be some of the most damning of all and so hillarys people panicked and decided to pull the trigger",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,93.82490884357614,42,6,2095,339,5.147492625368732,339.0,-0.6102537459449576,-0.7657300402589515,-0.2338277914670419,-0.2465110635953146,0.0576059940561533,-0.2406769764388348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.6521,0.086,0.105,0.809,Negative,Strong

since donald trump entered the election over a year ago he has singlehandedly destroyed the gop leaving both the house and the senate in utter disarray but although many political strategists believe permanent damage has been done conservatives shouldnt lose hope yet because speaker of the house paul ryan has just emerged fully nude from an ayahuasca tent with visions of a new republican party 
a fresh gop platform requires fresh leadership and when speaker ryan journeyed to south america last week to embark on an immersive psychedelic vision quest of political rebirth he just proved hes the only one for the job 
after traveling to peru and entering a makeshift tent with nothing but a towel  mg of dmt and a bucket to vomit in paul ryan rwis spent the last  hours lying nude on the jungle floor enduring bursts of vivid consciousness in which he watched the secrets of a unified more moderate gop unfold before his very eyes 
while under the influence of the powerful psychedelic ancient spiritual guides appeared before the congressman instructed him to remove his clothes and held him down as lifelike projections of republican leaders twisted and contorted around him until the perfect cabinet had revealed itself amid infinite realities in which tax cuts and fiscal budgets exploded into cacophonous symphonies all to create a republican party that mobilizes key voter constituencies 
check out these tweets he posted just a few moments after emerging nude from his tent in the amazon rain forest 
whoa democrats have been pretty confident this past year but if paul ryans visions of the republican party are right they better watch out 
say what you want about paul ryan but hes a man who refuses to give up on the one hand is it possible that the speakers grand ayahuasca visions of a new republican party are just a temporary fix sure but on the other hand if he plays his cards right his proposals could have an even larger impact than they did during the thousands of years he lived while trapped inside his own mind

Jon Anthony,game is a modern rite of passage that helps turn boys into men,"i remember signing up for facebook ten years ago at this point in time the new social media site was geared mostly toward college students and it was uncommon for anyone over the age of  to have an account 
but over the last decade weve seen facebook morph into a  billion conglomerate and information kingpin acquiring massive power and wealth from the endless amounts of time users waste scrolling through their news feeds this beast of a social media platform has gone on to consume the lives of millions gather nefarious amounts of data foster unnecessary personal dramas and often cause more harm than good for its users 
it would be prudent to take a good hard look at your facebook experience and ask yourself if its something thats actually adding value to your life here are five reasons why you should think carefully before using the worlds largest social media site 
 your facebook feed is a black hole of completely worthless information 
i think its important to create streams of information that add real value to your life through platforms such as twitter feedly and youtube ive followed writers and content producers that have dedicated their lives to selfimprovement entrepreneurship higher meaning and the search for truth 
so you can probably imagine the stark difference between an intellectually curated twitter feed and the dumbeddown facebook community of people you went to high school with that peaked in the th grade 
log into your facebook and the most common information youll likely find is who got married who had kids and who got fat scrolling through your facebook feed is akin to flipping through a more personalized celebrity gossip magazine at the grocery store checkout line 
every time i log onto facebook im immediately reminded why i never log onto facebook 
 its no longer useful for dating 
in college i gained some value out of the site by using its chat feature to build up attraction with girls in my social circle and get their phone numbers 
but over the years most girls have attached the creepy stigma to guys who hit them up via facebook messenger 
in addition to that you dont really need a facebook profile for social proof as you once did since instagram is a better social media app for meeting girls  
 forfeiture of your privacy 
most people have realized by now that the first thing a potential employer will do after interviewing you is look you up on facebook theyre basically searching for any and every reason not to hire you lock your account down as best you can with privacy functions dont let that one drunk picture of you from  years ago ruin a potential job offer 
if that wasnt enough facebook has a long history of shady activities when it comes to privacy theyve already been caught accessing your location without permission we can only speculate what else theyve been infringing on

 censorship 
although facebook has a right to control the information broadcasted on its platform that doesnt mean they should abuse that right by censoring anything they might find disagreeable or offensive 
much like an overbearing parent facebook proactively controls the discourse of its children eagerly censoring content that might rub someone the wrong way facebook has so many overreaches that an entire website has been dedicated to documenting their affronts on freedom of opinion you can probably guess which side of the political spectrum they try to stifle

 it brings out the worst in people 
plenty of time has now passed for indepth research to come out regarding the longterm effects that too much facebook can have on a persons mental wellbeing it gives the illusion that everyone else has it better than you and that your life just isnt fair this is a slippery slope into a victim mindset and blaming others for your circumstances how oppressed these chronic facebook users are as they sip lattes from a comfy chair in starbucks and scroll through their facebook feeds on the latest macbook

i wont completely deny the merits of facebook if youre using it to build a brand or a business then it could be a good investment of your time simply because so many people actively use it ive also witnessed the joy it brings to older users for connecting with long lost friends they havent seen in decades 
but the truth is that in many cases facebook does cause more trouble than its worth its never a bad idea to cut back on your usage or even just opt out entirely you may no longer be the first to know about an upcoming dinner party or what brad and sarah from freshman year have been up to all these years but i suspect you might be better off as a person

Jason Easley,the media is getting desperate and pushing a bogus trump comeback story,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat oct th  at  pm you do know you just attacked a gold star family one adviser warned trump whats that he asked share on twitter print this post 
gabriel sherman writes at new york mag that when donald trump attacked the khan family over khizr khans speech at the democratic national convention he had no idea what a gold star family was 
you will remember that khizr khan stood up in front of the entire world and said to donald trump let me ask you have you even read the united states consitution i will gladly lend you my copy in this document look for the words liberty and equal protection of the law 
the fallout was predictable donald trump openly criticized lost it he attacked the khans religious beliefs saying if you look at his wife she was standing there she had nothing to say she probably maybe she wasnt allowed to have anything to say 
now it turns out that he had no idea what he was doing because he is ignorant and because as mark cuban has observed he isnt interested in learning anything gabriel sherman explains 
you do know you just attacked a gold star family one adviser warned trump trump didnt know what a gold star family was whats that he asked to trump khizr khan and his wife ghazala were enemies who had said something mean about him just like rosie odonnell and any number of people who had gotten under his skin over the years wasnt it his right to respond ?the election is about the american people its not about you? manafort told trump according to a person briefed on the conversation trump countered with breitbarts report on khans purported belief in sharia ?hes not running for president? manafort shot back ?the clintons did this to us to waste our time getting off message? 
of course trump could not and would not admit his own ignorance and he certainly wasnt prepared to take the blame instead as sherman reveals he took it out on manafort in front of his senior advisors including ailes according to trump manafort wasnt able to get the media to focus on the right stuff 
no wonder when trump refuses to take manaforts advice and focus on the right stuff this is not to defend manafort who is at least as despicable as his boss but it serves as an example of how trumps first reaction each and every time is to get back at his critic 
it was one of donald trumps most visible joe mccarthy moments and his response to khizr khan actually reinforced the point khan was trying to make

AR Staff,when the river ran red,"why obama will win jared taylor american renaissance august  
it is time to get used to the idea that the next president of the united states will be black why will a nation we are so often assured is racist elect a black president and will it make a difference 
ever since hillary clinton dropped out of the race the polls have reported consistently that barack obama will beat john mccain the media love to tell us that whites say they support the black candidate and then vote for the white but there is no reason for whites to lie in this campaign mr obama will not get a majority of the white vote but he will get enough to beat mr mccain why will so many whites vote for mr obama 
first some support his policies they want to end the war in iraq and they want the standard liberal program of socialized medicine higher taxes more handouts and more government there has always been a substantial minority of whites who vote this way and they have a clear favorite in mr obama 
second as many people have pointed out an enormous number of whites think it is deeply virtuous to vote for a blacknot for an outandout race man such as jesse jackson or al sharpton but for an unthreatening wellscrubbed black who speaks standard english and promises to bring us together even if they live sharply segregated lives whites thrill to the language of coming together and they adore blacks who dont act or sound black 
for many whites voting for mr obama will be an act of high patriotism electing him will prove america is not racist and many whites believe that rising above racism is americas sacred calling one must never underestimate the importance to whites of feeling virtuous most would rather lose a leg than be thought a bigot and a vote for obama is a painless way to burnish antiracist credentials 
third young whites will line up for mr obama they have been swallowing antiwhite multiculti propaganda all their lives and have not knocked around enough to discover it is false some who know their parents will vote for mr mccain will make a special point of voting for mr obama every new generation thinks it is cooler hipper and wiser than any generation that ever lived and what could be cooler hipper or wiser than putting a black man in the white house for many young whites a vote for mr obama will be a denial of every uncool unhip and especially every even faintly racerealist thing their parents ever said or did 
fourth although the country seems to have a collective memory of no more than two weeks americans think everything is historic whenever someone breaks an obscure record in professional baseball we are told history was made if you ask someone why he waited in line all night to buy the first apple iphone he will tell you its a historic product americans love anything that is historic and for people who think a few more stolen bases are history right up there with the battle of lepanto putting a black man in the white house will be the discovery of america pearl harbor and the second coming all rolled into one many whites will vote for mr obama because they want to think they helped make history 
the media which has its own grim reasons for supporting mr obama is mesmerized by the same prospect editors salivate at the thought of writing headlines like history is made the day after the election and some will lose all selfcontrol and add an exclamation mark the emphasis of course will be on mr obama as the first black president implying more to come the media which always subtly boost the democrat will be even more blatantly partisan this time downplaying every blunder mr obama makes and highlighting mr mccains 
fifth many whites will vote for mr obamaor at least not vote for mr mccainbecause the republicans have nominated the most stunningly unattractive candidate in years old and pockmarked mr mccain is thoroughly disliked in the senate for arrogance that he cannot even hide from voters when he is not speaking from notes he has dismayed republicans by promoting amnesty for illegals and dismayed everyone else by saying america should stay in iraq for  years if it takes that long to win mr obama therefore has the enormous advantage of running against an opponent that not even republicans like 
mr obama will also crush mr mccain in facetoface debates mr mccain cannot put an unscripted sentence together any better than george w bush can and will come across as a thickwitted geezer mr obama who is as glib as any politician gives credence to hl menckens definition of democracy as rule by orators 
but what about americas storied racism isnt america brimming with people who cant bear the thought of a black president americans have been numbed for decades by attractive televisionblacks who read the news forecast the weather and tell us which brand of toothpaste to buy americans get a steady diet of heroic movieblacks who outsmart and beat up white brutes solve baffling technical problems dispense sage advice and save the world even the current miss usa is black there are millions of whites who do not want to live with blacks or have much to do with them but would a black president be much different from nearly eight years of black secretaries of state the march of blackness may be vaguely worrying to whites but they think there is nothing they can do about it and that they shouldnt even if they could 
the final reason why whites will vote for mr obama is that the republicans do not have the backbone to attack him in the only way that would work if they were serious they would fill the airways with jeremiah wright prancing and raving along with the message this is the man who married mr and mrs obama baptized their children and whom mr obama calls a family member they would buy radio ads quoting michelle obamas thesis in which she says she will always be black first and american second mr mccain has nothing like the stomach for a campaign like this 
many blacks probably think he has the stomach for considerably worse  percent think mr obama is in greater physical danger than any white politician and many say they would have warned him not to run for fear he would be killed an assassination would certainly be a shattering event there is no telling how many cities would go up in flames and thirdworld countries which have followed the obama nomination with unprecedented interest would help make it the most widely reported killing in history i have just returned from a muslim country in which everyone has heard of mr obama and likes him but most have never heard of john mccain whatever gruesome fantasies blacks may be spinning however assassination has gone out of style in america and white resistancesuch as it isis dependably nonviolent mr obama will be perfectly safe 
in any case mr obama will win far more white votes than he will lose because he is black whites who dont want a black president would not vote for a democrat anyway as for black voters even nominal republicans are said to be running for the doors but strictly racial voting has always been fine for blacks not so for whites of course just try telling your coworkers that you disagree with mr mccain but are voting for him because he is white 
racially conscious whites will be in a quandary in november even if mr mccains policies are worse than mr obamas should they vote for the white manone with an adopted bangladeshi daughter and who long ago betrayed white interests even after years of being softened up with black heroes and figureheads a black in the white house is a powerful symbol of white dispossession a mulatto president is an almost explicit endorsement of miscegenation this is bitter medicine 
some whites have argued that a black president would undercut the charges of racism whites are forever facing but they are dreaming the entire government could look like a meeting of the mystic knights of the sea but as long as blacks are worse off than whites we will be blamed for it sensible whites cannot cheerfully vote for either man i suspect most will stay home or vote for a minor candidate 
aside from the symbolic impact which cannot be calculated will president obama be much different from a president hillary clinton she would lard her cabinet with blacks and hispanics nominate ultraliberal judges push for amnesty grovel before nonwhites everywhere and load up the civil rights division of the justice department with antiwhite sharks she would certainly make a bigger fool of herself over hispanics and asians see  turning up the pressure  ar may  our choice therefore could not be more disagreeable on balance we get to decide which is the more degrading spectacle deluded white people giving their country away or cleareyed blacks helping themselves to it 
president obama will however face special pressures he cant let the pushier brothers walk all over him but he will have to throw them enough bones to keep them off his back it will be a tricky balance mr obamas first annual address to the naacp will be a love feast but every year after that it will be harder to explain why black unemployment poverty and incarceration rates havent changed at all 
even mr obamas starstruck white supporters will eventually wonder what happened to all that change he promised there is not going to be change the system is far too stuck in its selfserving ways for that with the help of an enlarged democratic majority in congress mr obama may set up some wheezing byzantine form of socialized medicine but no one will be happy with it if mr obama inherits a sick economy a weak dollar expensive oil and shrinking revenues americans will not at all like the change they get 
on the bright side with mr obama we have a good chance of piquant firstlady behavior what will the white house be like with michelle in charge will she want a new exterior paint job how and whom will she entertain will the big mans guest bedroomsin the african traditionbe turned over to third cousins from kenya and the south side of chicago there is no telling with what improprieties large and small mrs obama will entertain us as she makes up her mind whether she is an american 
it will be an edifying presidency and whites may be a little less deluded in ",amren.com,Fake,english,16.093066489392562,2.2264292892673696,22,5,10220,1809,4.634604754007739,1809.0,-1.221754532806611,-0.9536307555522068,1.9158170233692415,2.05797969779847,-0.4485640357292579,2.1176918749674187,0.0011055831951354,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0022040039040313,0.7343,0.119,0.108,0.773,Positive,Strong

EdJenner,limbaugh perfectly sums up why the lefts unwilling to face why trump really won,"poll sexism was not a factor in hillarys loss by aaron bandler november   
some leftists still reeling from hillary clintons stunning defeat on tuesday are blaming her defeat on supposed sexism against a woman president however a new poll suggests that sexism did not play a role at all in clintons loss 
the poll conducted by conquest communications group and published on just facts  featured a question specifically geared toward gauging potential sexism if you were faced with a choice between a male and a female presidential candidate who would you vote for 
here were the results emphasis added 
overall  of voters said it does not matter  preferred a female  preferred a male  were unsure and  refused to answer 
male voters and trump voters were more likely than any other groups to say it does not matter at  and  respectively the other groups were not far behind and within the margins of error with rates of  for clinton voters  for undecided voters  for females 
naturally supporters of trump were more likely to support a male president than a female president percent to  percent respectivelyand clinton supporters were more likely to support female president than a male president  percent to  percent respectively 
the survey was conducted from october  so it was taken a couple of weeks before the election but its hard to imagine a majority of voters all of a sudden turned into a bunch of sexists 
there is a little bias towards a male president among trump voters and a little bias towards a female president among clinton voters but the results of the survey suggest that overall the genitalia of a candidate is not a significant factor involved in most voters when it comes to choosing the next president of the united states

how to have honest elections it is enough that the people know there was an election the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything  joseph stalin 
following the florida election debacle of  americans were promised a more honest transparent and verifiable system of elections we didnt get it because the elkection stealers won that election and decided that keeping the current system was their best guaarantee of reelection 
the election of  changed that the candidate being cheated by the system donald trump still prevailed thanks to a landslide that overcame the vote rigging he will see having an honest election system as his best chance for a second term hence there is a real opportunity to throw out the current system whch is designed to encourage stealing elections and replace it with a system that hinders cheating as much as possible 
to begin stolen elections are a reality in this nation john f kennedy stole the  election from richard nixon nixon stole his reelection in what becvame known as the watergate scandal george w bush likely stole the  election from al gore and everyone had a ringside seat watching hillary clinton trying to steal the election from donald trump 
a good place to start to learn about election stealing is the hbo documentary hacking democracy it is available on netflix amazon live and hulu here is a youtube video of the final scenes showing how an electronic voting machine has the election results changed without even needing to touch the machine 
for more information please visit httpblackboxvotingorg  the website operated by bev harris who is featured in the hbo documentary 
now then i wish to offer a suggestion for a very simple way to have an open and honest election system it is not  foolproof but is designed to make it very difficult for cheating to happen and difficult to conceal it this stands in sharp contrast to the current system which is designed to facilitate and conceal the manipulation of elections 
first some basic rules 
 no electronic machines 
 no central tabulation centers 
everyone who votes must have id to prove they are a us citizen and eligable to vote absentee ballots are only given to those who can prove they are unable to vote in person 
after the voters vote their finger is marked with ink that takes a week to fade away to prevent them from voting more than once 
all voting is done on paper ballots when the polls close the precincts handcount the ballots in full view of witnesses and verify the accuracy all paper ballots are to be stored for an entire year after the election 
the totals for that polling place are posted for all to see and copies provided to all witnesses 
in the city newspaper the next day all the totals for all the city precincts are printed along with totals for the state this allows everyone to first verify that their precinct totals were reported accurately and to verify the math leading to the city totals for themselves 
now we move up a level the state newspapers print all the city totals and again the totals for the state this allows everyone to first verify that their city totals were reported accurately and to verify the math leading to the state totals for themselves 
final level the national newspapers print all the state totals and tally up the winners this allows everyone to first verify that their state totals were reported accurately and to verify the math leading to the national totals for themselves 
what this does is create a system where there are literally millions of americans watching and verifying the vote counts from polling place to final totals yes it is a bit slower than the instantguessing on tv but that will prevent the corporate media from using projections to try to discourage voters of unfavored candidates from heading to the polls there is in fact no law that says the winners of the elections have to be announced immediately and certainly most americans are willing to trade speed for accuracy in such an important matter in the early days of this nation prior to the telegraph it would take weeks for the populace to learn who won the elections 
as i said this is not a  perfect system it is only as good as the people running it but it does make stealing elections very difficult and that should always be the design objective of any election system share this article with your social media",westernjournalism.com,Real,english,98.4,82.22642928926737,8,2,4823,834,4.747002398081535,834.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,0.4879237229789127,0.5294909274862658,-0.3376385839386462,0.5534676367898017,0.0023980815347721,0.0,0.001199040767386,0,1,0.0,0.0050932004606873,-0.3753,0.079,0.073,0.849,Negative,Moderate

it is global societys will that all want to cooperate to combat climate change a senior beijing negotiator said in morocco on friday at the first round of un talks since the paris deal was sealed last december the chinese negotiators added that any movement by the new us government would not affect their transition towards becoming a greener economy
china worked closely with the administration of outgoing president barack obama to build momentum ahead of the  paris agreement on climate change the partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly  countries to support the pact at the historic meet in frances capital
by contrast trump has called global warming a hoax created by china to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the united states from the historic climate agreement as well as reverse many of obamas measures to combat climate change

china is expected to play a pivotal role in consolidating and enhancing southsouth partnership particularly when it comes to issues related to climate change
china is steadily ramping up efforts to assist other developing countries in addressing climate change a gesture that has received wide welcome
speaking to the chinese news agency xinhua moroccan foreign minister and climate change conference cop president salaheddine mezouar said that china has an extremely important role to play in accompanying reinforcing and boosting southsouth partnership and support sustainable development policies in the african continent
xie ji deputy chief of the chinese delegation to the ongoing nd session of the conference of the parties cop  said on nov  that china has ironed out a concrete program to help other developing countries to become more climateresilient we will help build up ten lowcarbon pilot zones launch  climate change mitigation and adaptation projects and offer training programs for  climaterelated professionals he said
what xie called the  project is part of the effort that china has made in recent years to help other developing countries fight against climate change the country has earmarked a total of  million yuan about us million since  to help developing countries according to zhang yucheng deputy director of the international cooperation division of the department of climate change of the national development and reform commission ndrc

here is a sufi story that addresses the very same concept but in a different manner that of strength as opposed to what is typically perceived as weakness dont just read the story reflect on it extend it out in your mind and see where it takes you in that search you will discover issues within yourself that must be addressed 
there once was a sufi master who was a soldier 
during a protracted war he was at one point engaged in fierce mortal combat in the thick of furious battle he finally overcame a vicious determined foe besting the enemy and driving him to ground the sufi closed in for the kill 
at the very moment he was about to deliver a fatal thrust of his sword to the neck of his prostrate enemy his foe cried out in anguish ah if only i had your sword for a single moment how different things would be 
at once the sufi stopped his attack and surrendered his sword to his fallen enemy 
the soldier was dumbfounded 
taking the sword from the sufi he said why did you do this you could have killed me i was lost and now you stop and present me with your sword why would you do such a stupid thing  for it is now i who will kill you  
the sufi shrugged i come from a family that grants any request no matter how great he replied cooly you asked for my sword i am honor bound to fulfill your request 
the fallen soldier rose and recognizing the sufi as a perfected master returned his sword to him falling at the feet of the man who had just spared his life he asked to become his disciple

Admin,occupier david fry released from jail im really free,"one twitter user once asked me is it too much to hope that one of our parties would pick someone with no links to a pedophile sexslave island 
apparently it is too much to ask for 
both presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump and former president bill clinton have ties to convicted pedophile and democratic donor billionaire jeffery epstein and sex slave island 
note president bill clinton is not merely the husband of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton either bill is currently campaigning for his wife plus hillary recently unveiled that bill with be in charge of  revitalizing the economy  if she were to take office 
it has been uncovered that clinton known for his troublemaking libido has even stronger ties to epstein than previously reported as noted by the free beacon  clinton was aboard the infamous lolita express owned by a billionaire pedophile at least  times not the initially reported  times 
fox news reports  
clintons presence aboard jeffrey epsteins boeing  on  occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between  and  included extended junkets around the world with epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including tatiana the trickedout jet earned its nabakovinspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girlsofficial flight logs filed with the federal aviation administration show clinton traveled on some of the trips with as many as  us secret service agents however on a fiveleg asia trip between may  and may   not a single secret service agent is listed 
the republican presumptive nominee apparently got in on the action too trumps ties to epstein  a man trump once called a terrific guy  and sex slave island have been chronicled by the daily wire here  
per the political insider trump is accused of threatening and raping a yearold girl on the private island  epstein is also named in the suit for sexual misconduct the lawsuit accusations have been vehemently denied by the trump camp alleging that the filing is a hoax and that there is no evidence that the plaintiff in question actually exists 
sex slave island sometimes referred to as orgy island both lovely names is one deranged place allegedly rife with solicited sex often from minors  groomed  by epstein

No Author,jy crois encore   par alain juppé en train deffectuer une réservation sur lastminutecom  le gorafi,"zika a masterpiece of public mind control 
saturday october   by natural news editors tags zika  mind control  propaganda naturalnews its been nearly nine months since the word zika flashed like a lightning bolt in the headlines of mainstream news before january   zika was just one of many viruses that public health officials monitored but suddenly in january of this year everything changed as a nearly harmless virus was transformed into a worldwide threatarticle by john p thomas republished from healthimpactnewscom as we will see the zika propaganda machine was turned on in october of  and it has been running wild ever since this is a classic example of a mind control program a public brainwashing project or a high powered marketing campaignregardless of what you call it it is clear that the mainstream news media the world health organization who the pan american health organization paho the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc big pharma big chem and both republicans and democrats have joined forces to sell a zika eradication program to the people of the united states and to the rest of the worldthis has been and continues to be one of the best orchestrated programs of propaganda in recent history this article will discuss how the program started how it has been developed and where it is going zika is not a threat to the babies of the world just to be absolutely clear from the beginning there is no solid evidence that zika is a threat to humanity it is a minimally dangerous viral infection which does not cause microcephalyin the almost  years since the zika virus was patented by the rockefeller foundation  no one ever noticed any association between zika infection of pregnant women and their babies being born with abnormally small heads or with defects in brain development but in  we were suddenly made aware of this supposed problem this claim based on nothing more than circumstantial evidence was the beginning point for the propaganda campaign a propaganda claim doesnt need to be true it just needs to be repeated over and over again until people believe it is trueafter half a year of fear and hysteria in the mainstream media even officials in brazil admit that zika is an unlikely cause of their microcephaly as reported in nature news  comment on july   an official from brazils ministry of health raises doubts to suggest zika is not the only factor in the reported microcephaly surge in his country the report stated zika virus has spread throughout brazil but extremely high rates of microcephaly have been reported only in the countrys northeast although evidence suggests that zika can cause microcephaly the clustering pattern hints that other environmental socioeconomic or biological factors could be at play we suspect that something more than zika virus is causing the high intensity and severity of cases says fatima marinho director of information and health analysis at brazils ministry of health if that turns out to be true it could change researchers assessment of the risk that zika poses to pregnant women and their children  despite this admission from brazil the zika propaganda campaign is moving ahead without interruption the campaign will not be stopped by contrary evidence about zika and microcephaly zika is a mild viral infection most people who get zika will be completely unaware of being infected for those who do get sick it is similar in many ways to having a cold or a mild case of the flu people experience fever rash joint pain and conjunctivitis the illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week infection is thought to provide lifelong immunity severe disease requiring hospitalization is uncommon deaths are rare the fact that almost no one dies from zika infection made it a very unlikely candidate for the development of a vaccine for those who actually feel sick from a zika infection they can receive comfort care and rest while their immune systems overcome the viral illness zika press releases set the stage for a propaganda campaign however if zika could be connected to some other horrible consequence such as microcephaly or paralysis guillainbarre syndrome for example then people would insist that we create a zika vaccine and would insist that every person on planet earth take it they would be willing to give up basic individual freedoms for the benefit of society which is always the goal of mind control programsin  a number of press releases and reports were released by the pan american health organization  world health organization pahowho and the cdc to set the stage for the unfolding of a grand mind control projectthe documents they published raised the red flag of alarm that a zika epidemic was unfolding throughout south america and mexico the conventional media got excited about the epidemic when they saw the word microcephaly the prospect of large numbers of babies being born with abnormally small heads and brains was a story that would really grab the attention of their audiencethe media used pictures of deformed babies to build fear in the hearts of people and to create the perception that we better watch out or zika is going to get us and our babies they worked really hard to instill public panic about zika in january and february of  in the timeline that follows you will see the word autochthonous public health agencies use the word autochthonous to say that an infection was locally generated an autochthonous case of zika is one that was acquired in the local area where a person lives this is in contrast with a zika infection that was acquired while visiting another region or countryi will list a few of the key points from some press releases to show how a foundation for the zika campaign was built and how momentum was established to project the campaign into mainstream media may  brazil confirms first autochthonous cases of zika  october  columbia confirms first autochthonous cases of zika  october  brazil reports unusually high number of babies with microcephaly  november  el salvador guatemala mexico paraguay suriname and venezuela report autochthonous zika infection  november   who calls upon member states to watch for the occurrence of microcephaly  december   pahowho issued the first of dozens of reports which chronicled the history of the growing zika epidemic and warned of microcephaly   december   who reports autochthonous zika infections in honduras  december   who reports autochthonous zika infections in panama  december   us cdc reports autochthonous zika infections in puerto rico and makes note of microcephaly in brazil  counting babies with microcephaly the mainstream media suddenly picked up on the zikamicrocephaly story in january of  and began sensationalizing it general concern was quickly transformed into alarm as officials in brazil reported a steady increase in the number of microcephaly cases as of january   they reported  cases of microcephaly andor central nervous system cns malformation suggestive of congenital infection they compared this with    data where there was an average of  microcephaly cases the brazil data about the babies was poor we didnt know their definition of microcephaly we didnt know how many of the mothers actually tested positive for zika we didnt know how the data was collected we also didnt know why there was a strong level of insistence that the only thing that could cause these birth defects was infection with the zika virus propaganda campaigns always dismissed other viewpoints other than the one being promoted they dont want an investigation of truth or a debate about the facts  they just want belief and submission the us propaganda machine goes public in january  cdc officials begin to ponder the situation first they say there might be an association between zika and microcephaly but they are far from asserting any kind of causative relationship good for them i thought when i heard that report but their apparent wisdom took a nosedive a minute later when the same cdc official went on to issue a travel warning to women to avoid traveling to brazil and other south american countries if they are pregnant think they might be pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant in the next couple yearswhat did the cdc just say there is no evidence of causation and we dont even know there is even a problem but women should stay home any way strange i thought as i began to remember how the conventional media the cdc and the who hyped up the african ebola epidemic in a similar kind of propaganda campaign just  months earlier the worldwide threat of ebola zaire completely died out long before a vaccine could be developed which must have been a major disappointment to big pharmabut this time they have a virus that is not going to die out this time their propaganda campaign will be much more sophisticated and it will make major steps toward the acceptance of universal mandatory vaccination for diseases such as zika a false international crisis involving deformed babies justifies action all through january and early february of  the news media provided us with a nonstop litany of stories about zika and deformed babies in a previous article i examined some of the headlines in the propaganda campaignthe cdc was still using the word possible association while the news media insisted on using the word cause despite the initial reserve of the cdc the news media began to shout the message across america zika is going to deform the heads of our babies while they are in the womb and theres no vaccine to protect usit seems like every zika story i saw included at least one photo of a baby with microcephaly and always stated that there is no vaccine yet we were reminded over and over again that zika is causing babies to be born with abnormally small heads mental retardation and blindness we were warned that some babies were dying at birth because of the severity of their brain deformation we were told that each baby born with microcephaly will cost ten million dollars or more in medical expenses during the childs life  these stories created ever increasing levels of apprehension and fear as they were intended to doas the mainstream media struggled to keep the fear level high and keep the story line flowing from week to week they began to focus in on government efforts to save us from zika it didnt take long for them to find people to interview who would ask the question they wanted asked what is the government going to do to protect our babies this question was asked over and over again even though there was no proof that zika infection and microcephaly were related the question was asked so many times by the media that no politician could dare to say i am not going to do anything because as far as we know zika doesnt cause microcephaly president obama responds to the question on february   president obama requested  billion dollars to study the situation and to develop a zika vaccine lets look at this more carefully we are going to spend  billion dollars to develop a vaccine for a virus that almost never kills anyone and has not been proven to cause birth defects  just to be safe or is something else going on hereperhaps the real story is that big pharma wants another cash cow vaccine and the zika threat has been promoted in such a way that people will insist that big pharma develop a zika vaccine for us suddenly big pharma companies will be able to put on their white hats and rescue all the babies of the world this would be such sweet deception if they could pull it off cdc declaration zika causes microcephaly the cdc announced in april of  that zika causes microcephaly this decision was based on a cdc analysis of available data they did not conduct comprehensive research they used a quacking duck kind of analysis if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck then it must be a duck they couldnt tell if it had feathers like a duck or has a bill like a duck but they still insisted on calling it a duck named zika in doing this they ignored some of the most important criteria in their analysiscdc researchers stated the seventh of shepards criterion proof in an experimental system that the agent acts in an unaltered state is aimed at medications or chemical exposures and does not apply to infectious agents thus given shepards criteria as a framework criteria   and  have been satisfied  evidence that is considered sufficient to identify an agent as a teratogen  in other words they used a set of seven criteria to determine whether zika could be considered to be a cause of microcephaly they determined that the association between zika infection and microcephaly was causative for  of the  criteria they suggested that additional study was needed before  of the other criteria could be met they excluded the seventh criteria altogether because it examined whether medications or chemicals might have caused microcephalyi couldnt believe that they excluded the seventh criteria when it is clear that microcephaly is known to be caused by pesticide exposure and could just as easily be caused by vaccinations during pregnancy as it was likely to be caused by zika infectionthese cdc scientists were only looking for causation from infectious agents nothing else seemed to matter this exclusionary mindset was present since the very beginning of the zika propaganda campaignthey ignored the effect of the tdap vaccine given to pregnant women in brazil in  they ignored the side effects of medications they ignored the consumption of gmo food glyphosate and pyriproxyfen that were widely used in brazil they ignored chemical exposure from brazils large chemical manufacturing facilities they ignored alcohol and drug use they ignored the effects of extreme multigenerational nutritional deficiencies and extreme poverty they ignored the introduction of genetically modified mosquitoes that were released in brazil they ignored exposure to rubella toxoplasmosis or cytomegalovirus they ignored the combined effects of all these factors as well as multigenerational modifications to the local gene pool from these potential causesi discussed these potential causes of microcephaly in my first article on zika published in january of there is one key point that i want to bring forward from the previous article concerning the number of babies born with microcephaly first we heard that there were some  cases of microcephaly in brazil after the initial shock and panic was produced we learned that further investigation showed that the number of confirmed cases was only the mainstream media also didnt mention that the number of babies born in the united states with microcephaly in a typical year is  when adjusting for population differences between the us and brazil we find that the rate of microcephaly in the us is actually  times higher than the rate in brazilin other words the us microcephaly incidence is much higher than brazil and our babies didnt get it from zika maybe our babies got it from the various potential causes i discussed in my previous articlei should also state that the researchers who put their names on this article are all employees of the cdc  i must question whether their analysis was truly objective and whether their findings were influenced by cdc ties to big pharma the zika vaccine is in the pipeline based on this single poor quality analysis its full speed ahead for developing a zika vaccine there are at least four companies plus the cdc working on a zika vaccine we are told that it will still take several years before a zika vaccine can be properly tested and made available in large quantities for the population of the worldzika vaccine trials have already begun and they are already recruiting volunteers in the us the us national institutes of health hopes to start phase ii trials of its vaccine in early   congress tries to protect our babies with zika funding now that the cdc has settled the zikamicrocephaly question it was time to get congress to fund the presidents request for a zika vaccine development program the house and the senate passed zika funding bills however they have different ideas of how much money should be spent and how the funds should be generated the funding process stalled at the end of june when the senate and house could not reconcile their differences congress went on a seven week summer vacation and wasnt available to try to resolve their differences this created a problem for the zika mind control campaign because it might mean there would be no new zika news to report during the summer keeping the propaganda campaign going by killing mosquitoes the mainstream media switched their focus from vaccine development to eradication of the aedes aegypti mosquito which is known to carry the zika virus if an infected mosquito bites a person then the person might develop the infection this is a fact that no one is disputing the great mosquito chase of  the cdc continues to count the number of zika cases in the us and puerto rico the numbers continue to rise through the spring and early summer they were looking for autochthonous cases of zika in the us but they could only find infected people who had traveled to zika infected countries or who had sex with people who traveled to those countriesfinally at the very end of july  people in the wynnewood section of miami florida were found to have zika even though they had not traveled to a zika infected country or had sex with a zika infected person public health officials at the state and federal level interpreted the presence of these cases to mean that zika must have been transmitted to these people by mosquito bites they ignored the possibility that the infected people might have been lying about their exposure for example having sexual contact with an infected person nevertheless officials concluded that they must implement a strong mosquito control program to prevent zika from spreading any furthernow that the zika epidemic was on us home soil the media had another fear inducing story to add to their propaganda campaign there are mosquitoes that are out to get you and our babies the governor of florida goes door to door to find more people with zika on august st the governor of florida contacted the us public health system and asked them to send a specially trained squad of federal public health agents to help with the zika emergency in miami these agents and florida officials went door to door in the wynwood neighborhood of miami and collected urine samples to identify additional cases of zika more cases were found but all were asymptomatic  the people didnt even know they were infected  problem  they cant find a zika infected mosquito  mosquitoes were tested for the presence of zika but all tests were negative officials dismiss the negative infection results by saying that finding a zika infected mosquito is like finding a needle in a haystack  aerial mosquito spraying program initiated the governor of florida in conjunction with federal public health agents decided that they needed to do aerial spraying of pesticide even though the aedes aegypti mosquito wouldnt travel more than  feet from its birth place in the wynwood neighborhood where the autochthonous zika cases were located the officials decided to spray a ten square mile area just to be safe a spraying program that covers ten square miles would make a sensational story in the media it would be much more alarming than a story about a neighborhood aerial spray zone it also would expose many more people to a toxic pesticide more about that laterthe first aerial spraying took place on august    toxic pesticide used in aerial spraying causes microcephaly officials told the public not to worry about the pesticide that was being sprayed because it naled is harmless they pointed to epa reports which supported their claim they didnt mention that naled was banned in europe in  they didnt mention that officials in puerto rico recently refused to allow the spraying of naled over their citizens they didnt mention that naled kills many other types of insects and aquatic creatures in addition to mosquitoes  most importantly official didnt mention that naled and the chemicals that are created when it breaks down in the environment have the potential for causing human birth defects  could pesticide naled cause microcephaly and other life threatening diseases officials didnt mention that the pesticide that they were spraying over the densely populated minority neighborhood of wynwood  was particularly dangerous for babies in the wombthis is what the journal of pesticide reform has to say about naled like all organophosphates naled dibrom is toxic to the nervous system symptoms of exposure include headaches nausea and diarrhea naled is more toxic when exposure occurs by breathing contaminated air than through other kinds of exposure in laboratory tests naled exposure caused increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning naleds breakdown product dichlorvos another organophosphate insecticide interferes with prenatal brain development in laboratory animals exposure for just  days during pregnancy when the brain is growing quickly reduced brain size  percent dichlorvos also causes cancer according to the international agency for research on carcinogens in laboratory tests it caused leukemia and pancreatic cancer two independent studies have shown that children exposed to household nopest strips containing dichlorvos have a higher incidence of brain cancer than unexposed children  emphasis added naled exposure causes increased aggressiveness and a deterioration of memory and learning these are some of the symptoms that are also found in children on the autism spectrumone of the most toxic break down products in naled is dichlorvos this chemical caused a  reduction in brain size in pregnant lab animals after  days of exposure another word for reduced brain size is microcephalyso the pesticide they are spraying could increase the rate of autism among children in the spray zone and could cause microcephaly to occur in the babies of pregnant womenquestion if there are babies born in miami with microcephaly in the next nine months or if the autism rate in the spray zone increases will we blame zika or naled i am sure that no one from the cdc or from a public health agency will ever point a finger at naled they will use the children to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that zika is to blame naled is also harmful to adults dr naresh kumar a professor of public health at the university of miami commented about the risks of using pesticides in aerial spraying his statement came from cbs miami all are a neurotoxin meaning it will directly affect our nervous system it will affect not only the pregnant woman  it is also equally for children who have asthma and airway disease because when you are spraying in the air these aerosols stay in the air for at least five days  the miami herald provided this advice to people in the pesticide spray zone they stated the agency epa says the insecticide poses no risk for the majority of people but those sensitive to chemicals may want to stay inside during spraying close windows and turn off window air conditioners fruits and vegetables should also be washed before eating and outdoor furniture and grills covered  so if you are concerned about being exposed to the chemicals they are spraying then you should stay inside for  days until the pesticide falls out of the air you should keep your windows closed and turn off window air conditioners i wonder how many people were able to follow this advice in the subtropical urban climate of miami in augustmind control programs always try to make life difficult for those who live outside the box of normality they want us to follow their instructions which in this case would be to just not worry about the spraying if you are concerned then you can take their ridiculous suggestions which wont really protect you from the spray does zika also cause guillainbarre syndrome apparently the cdc suspects that zika causes the paralytic syndrome called guillainbarre if you look at the data collection forms for monitoring zika in the us you will see another masterful stroke of mind control in the making they are counting cases of guillainbarre syndrome on the same form with cases of zika why would the cdc try to make this connection the cdc indicates on their guillainbarre syndrome page that they are not sure what causes this syndrome they do mention that there were some cases of guillainbarre syndrome associated with the swine flu vaccine in  but otherwise the condition is rare with unknown etiology if they can make a case for the zika virus being the cause of guillainbarre syndrome then they will shift attention away from the fact that many vaccines and pesticides have a harmful effect on the human nervous system and are able to produce this type of paralysisi anticipate seeing a guillainbarre syndrome research paper just like the one produced by the cdc on microcephaly their new paper will just substitute the phrase guillainbarre syndrome for the word microcephaly they will show through statistical smoke and mirrors that the zika virus is causative for guillainbarre syndrome as well as microcephalyif they can pull this off then the zika virus will be blamed for all cases of vaccine damage in which microcephaly or paralysis results if they can pull this off and i suspect they will then pesticide manufacturers will also be able to blame the zika virus for microcephaly neurological malformation and paralysis that results from the use of their products the zika virus will be the perfect scapegoat the list of birth defects being blamed on zika with no evidence is increasing propaganda campaigns always seek to worsen the devastating effects of whatever they want us to fear first we heard that zika causes microcephaly then we heard that it might also cause guillainbarre syndrome now we are hearing that zika causes a whole host of other birth defects some of which might not appear until months or even years after birththe new york times stated the images of babies with microcephaly published tuesday in the journal radiology also suggest a grim possibility because some of the damage was seen in brain areas that continue to develop after birth it may be that babies born without obvious impairment will experience problems as they grow images of another baby girl show contracted hands and arms the result of another common symptom zika seems to damage the nerves in a developing fetus so that sometimes muscles arent developing normally because they dont have the nerve impulses to move normally she dr levine said with such a vicious and unpredictable virus its key to realize that zika is more than microcephaly that theres a number of other abnormalities as theyve shown in this paper and its effects are going to be even more broad said dr spong whose agency has begun a study of what will ultimately be  babies born in zika epidemic areas including brazil and puerto rico its going to be essential to follow them to look at their development to look at their ability to learn to look at hearing problems balance problems behavior problems all those issues to make sure that we dont miss anyone  zika the new scapegoat for all childhood diseases can you tell where this is going it seems to me that they are planning to put together a catalog of major injuries that results from zika infectionit will include most if not all injuries that result from vaccines pesticides gmo food pharmaceutical drugs the highcarbohydrate lowfat standard american diet and anything else that might lead to a successful lawsuit against big pharma or big chem zika might just become the standard defense for suit against corporations it wasnt our product that harmed this little baby it was zika conclusion another government tool for the greater good to strip away freedoms it wont be long before the mainstream media will be showing us pictures of us babies from florida who were born with microcephaly the mainstream media will tug at our heartstrings and will remind us that this horror will soon become preventable when the zika vaccine is developedwe will hear about more and more connections between zika and other terrible health conditions experienced by children we will be told that all this suffering and all this expense will be avoided when all the mosquitoes are killed and everyone receives the zika vaccinemind control programs always talk about the greater good and how individuals must give up their individual freedoms their rights and even their preferences for the sake of the collective benefit zika will be one of the tools used by mind

Ludwig Watzal,mark zuckerberg dont get hoodwinked by media and politicians,"the iraqi city of karbala where the holy shrine of the third shia imam imam hussein is located is swarming with millions of devoted muslims both shiites and sunnis for mourning rituals marking arbaeen known as the largest religious gathering in the world  shares
   
given the mainstream medias constant sensationalized reporting on terror and muslims in the western world the utter lack of coverage of arbaeens march on sunday and monday revealed the double standard that exists in reporting on peaceful muslims
monday marked the final day of the mourning for imam hussein who was martyred in a battle with the massive army of yazid after refusing allegiance to the tyrant caliph yazid the caliph of umayyad dynasty was promoting the same type of islam as isis and wahhabist preach today
millions of marchers participated in the annual arbaeen procession in karbala the marchers are said to come from over  countries and most of them have marched all the way to karbala from other iraqi cities like najaf and baghdad in a show of devotion each year sunni muslims and followers of other religious groups such as christians join the journey to mourn the martyrdom of imam hussein
arbaeen or mourning is a shia muslim tradition to mark the anniversary of seventhcentury social justice leader imam husain arbaeen is commemorated  days after ashura the martyrdom anniversary of imam hussein as and his companions in  ad however in light of isis terror attacks globally several people took the controversial step of turning their march political in order to denounce terror in all forms
tens of thousands of muslims have been killed and displaced by isiss declared caliphate an exponentially larger number than those killed in attacks in the west
more the walk of light  arbaeen pilgrimage rises a great resistance against radicalism messenger   muslims develop technology to promote religious unity against radicalism why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity the occasion has found additional significance in recent years as it has become a rallying cry for the campaign against isis terrorists who have frequently targeted the pilgrims
iraqi troops have been deployed to ensure security for the pilgrims the northern and western parts of iraq have been plagued by gruesome violence ever since isis terrorists began a campaign of terror in the country in june 
the terrorist campaign however has not dissuaded pilgrims from around the world from making the journey
it is noteworthy to mention the mainstream media blackout of the millions people marched gathering in war torn iraq battling the isis as a clear sign of biased reporting",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,2.2264292892673696,60,9,2733,445,5.114606741573033,445.0,-0.0599030377694696,-0.2020278943791856,-0.065031066314359,-0.0803368998485519,0.0251508518898608,-0.0706177259292682,0.0022471910112359,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0055662171051665,-0.9931,0.08,0.163,0.757,Negative,Very Strong

 you have no idea how much you are eating 
ever wonder why you cant gain any muscle or lose any body fat well the first place to look for the answer is your diet are you eating the requisite amount of calories for your goals if you want to gain muscle you have to eat more calories than you burn whereas if you want to lose body fat you have to eat fewer calories than you burn there is no way around this simple fact even though this is nothing more than a grade school physics problem im still baffled by the number of guys out there whining about being hardgainers or endomorphs invest in a food scale and track your intake its really not that hard 
 you are constantly looking for the next best supplement to take 
this is the game equivalent of asking for the one magic pick up line that will allow you to swoop top shelf girls left and right the hard truth is that the vast majority of supplements are a complete waste of money guys flock to supplements because its an easy fix instead of putting in the time and hard work needed to obtain the results they desire they look for shortcuts in order to get ahead unfortunately these shortcuts dont exist the only time you should be worrying about supplements is when you have all of the other nutritional building blocks in place 
 you think you dont have the time to eat healthy 
a lot of guys complain about being too busy to eat nutritious meals made mostly of whole foods guys will also complain about not having enough time to hit the gym after work or during their lunch break the problem here is not one of time  but rather of priorities  guys would rather sleepin than get up early to make themselves a good lunch to take to work the bottom line is this if you value your health then find the time to make yourself nutritious meals ditch the excuses 
 you think there is one best diet for everyone 
ive been in this game long enough to know that there is no one particular diet that is best for everyone i remember about  years ago people were losing their minds over the atkins diet about  years later people moved on to the paleo diet and now intermittent fasting is all the rage new diets will always be on the horizon which pretty much guarantees that arguments on the internet about which diet is the best will never end i do not know what the best diet is what i do know is that all good diets have several things in common such as being based around whole foods and acknowledging the importance of portion control protein fiber and other important nutrients aside from these basics whether you eat low carb or high carb three meals a day or six meal is entirely up to you and your lifestyle but make sure you get the basics down first

hillary clinton suffered a cracked head her words after suffering a fall in december  many have speculated about her health since that episode and questions grew louder in september of this year when hillary was caught on tape nearly collapsing at a  memorial event in manhattan 
after initially blaming the health scare on dehydration the campaign was forced to acknowledge the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia 
it was unclear whether abedin was referring to a serious ailment the new york post added 
in january  breitbart reported 
democrat frontrunner hillary clintons disappearance from the debate stage last month left people speculating that the former first lady took a long bathroom break but now a lawenforcement source with inside connections is alleging that clinton was missing from the stage due to health issues stemming from a previous brain injury

originally published by the gatestone institute raymond ibrahim is a shillman fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
as the muslim persecution of christians continues to reach critical proportions around the world see report below the average american shows much more concern than the current administration soon after it was revealed that the obama administration has taken in  muslim refugees but only  christianseven though christians are approximately  percent of syrias population and are classified as experiencing a genocide therea poll found that more than three quarters of american respondents agreed with the statement it is important to me that the next us president be committed to addressing the persecution that some christians face around the world eg imprisonment beheadings rape loss of home and assets 
the deliberate targeting and killing of christians in europe also reached unprecedented levels in modern times most notably on the morning of july   allahu akbar  shouting muslims stormed a small church in france during morning mass they forced yearold fr jacques hamel to his knees slit his throat and  critically injured  a nun before being killed by police it was later revealed that police had known that church was being targeted and had even been monitoring one of the murderers for at least oneandahalf years 
later when a journalist asked pope francis if fr jacques was  killed in the name of islam  the pope disagreed he argued that he hears of christians committing violence every day in italy this one who has murdered his girlfriend another who has murdered the motherinlaw and these are baptized catholics there are violent catholics if i speak of islamic violence i must speak of catholic violence the logic of the popes statement seems to be that violence done in direct contradiction of the judeochristian gods commandmentssuch as the murder of wives and mothersinlawis identical to violence done in accordance with allahs commandments to wage jihad on infidels

egypt  after a christian man was stabbed to death and many christian homes and a church burned by angry muslims because of a rumor that a church was going to be built coptic christian bishop makarious of alminya was interviewed on television church authorities in egypt are regularly diplomatic and sensitive to what they say but makarious made many revealing comments although only christians no muslims were killed and hurt he wondered why the government and media continue to describe these incidents as clasheswhich suggests two quarrelling partieswhen the reality is always that one side attacks the other within minutes of the start of one of the attacks  muslims instantly appeared fully armed as if ready for war he added as long as the attackers are never punished and the armed forces are portrayed as doing their duty this will just encourage others to continue the attacks since even if they are arrested they will be quickly released when the host asked questions about who is released and why suggesting that perhaps those released are in fact innocent of any wrongdoing against the christians the bishop replied well what do you think when the actual attackers themselves are arrested with complete proofs and evidences against them but then they are still declared innocent and released this happens every single time about this series 
the persecution of christians in the islamic world has become endemic accordingly muslim persecution of christians was developed to collate someby no means allof the instances of persecution that surface each month it serves two purposes 
 to document that which the mainstream media does not the habitual if not chronic persecution of christians 
 to show that such persecution is not random but systematic and interrelatedthat it is rooted in a worldview inspired by islamic sharia 
accordingly whatever the anecdote of persecution it typically fits under a specific theme including hatred for churches and other christian symbols apostasy blasphemy and proselytism laws that criminalize and sometimes punish with death those who offend islam sexual abuse of christian women forced conversions to islam theft and plunder in lieu of jizya financial tribute expected from nonmuslims overall expectations for christians to behave like cowed dhimmis  or thirdclass tolerated citizens and simple violence and murder sometimes it is a combination thereof 
because these accounts of persecution span different ethnicities languages and localesfrom morocco in the west to indonesia in the eastit should be clear that one thing alone binds them islamwhether the strict application of islamic sharia law or the supremacist culture born of it

pj media 
valerie jarrettbarack obamas closest consigliere who has lived in the lap of luxury in and out of the white houseis calling for james comeys head because the fbi director reopened the matter of hillary clintons emails only days before the election 
as we all know comey did this after some  digital missives many from clintons server were discovered on anthony weiners laptop by the nypd 
obama however is a bit uneasy about jarretts hawkishness toward comey 
valerie argued that comey was interfering deliberately in the election process and had to be stopped a source told the new york post  the same source said obama though is worried about the consequences of taking such an action  the tsunami of outrage that would come his way and possibly become a major footnote or worse in the history of the presidency 
ah those legacy problems not that the president has much of one outside the comically named affordable care act which is about as popular as stomach cancer 
nevertheless hes right about the tsunami of outrage in fact its an understatement the bad news is this as miserable as this endless election season has been the aftermath is likely to be far worse you dont have to be nostradamus to see that putting the american humpty dumpty together again is going to be a herculean task our country could be permanently fractured in ways few of us would have anticipated even a year ago anything is possible now 
if hillary clinton is elected the very next day millions of americans will be watching to see what will happen with the fbi and the justice department since we can now assume this will be a close election that would be nearly half the voters in this country sixty to seventy million people almost all of whom believe clinton the woman a few weeks from inauguration as president should have been charged with serious crimes and belonged behind bars not in the white house 
moreover many have seen the wikileaks that reek of collusion between the clintonistas and officials at the fbi and justice not to mention with virtually all the mainstream media outlets that were distrusted to begin with and are now reviled 
if thats not an explosive situation what is and we dont know what assange et al have in store for us after the election just now we learned that the clinton foundation acceptedwhile her ladyship was secretary of state and in honor of bills birthdayan unreported one million dollar donation from that paragon of womens and gay rights qatar this is chump change in the grand clinton scheme of things but another reminder of their unending greed and corruption more importantly as tyler durden points out this time there should be legal consequences for the foundationor would be normally in a country governed by the rule of law 
only were not anymore 
this and a thousand other things put obama quite possibly liable himself from the email disclosures and his attorney general lynch behind a treacherous eight ball going forward because they are not dealing with a few thousand disgruntled people but those many millions if they were to go ahead with jarretts suggestion take comeys head i e fire him and replace him with a yet more complaisant successor who knows what would happen 
but if they dont and even if they do the investigation may reveal things so shocking the nation will never be the same rumors have been flying that are so extreme that even a ten percent accuracy rate could ignite a firestorm 
the problem for all of us is that there is literally nothing clinton can do to get out of this box even if as many predict obama pardons her the corruption is so pervasive there is no way short of an actual military putsch to stop the continuing revelations and such an action would itself unleash  well you know the title of this article

Michael Snyder,will michelle obama be the replacement nominee if the fbi email investigation ends hillary clintons campaign,"posted by daisy luther 
according to a report in the new yorker james comey  big kahuna of the fbi went fullon cowboy in releasing details of the new clinton email inquiry apparently the department of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election 
gosh i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was donald trump who was being investigated by the fbi 
comey explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees  
we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record 
the doj  and by doj i mean attorney general loretta lynch  who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill clinton to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election 
heres comeys letter to the senate judiciary committee 
really 
the doj thinks that the public shouldnt know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi 
thats the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time and considering this election thats really saying something 
this is from the new yorker report emphasis mine 
on friday james comey the director of the federal bureau of investigation acting independently of attorney general loretta lynch  sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary clintons private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  
comeys decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials comey who is a republican appointee of president obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign 
hillary clinton has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source  
oh ill bet she does 
ill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach 
of course when its her things are a little different arent they 
we do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her 
and the fact that we know has severely damaged clintons campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over donald trump due to the clinton email scandal 
about a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support clinton given fbi director james comeys disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state  
finally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary clinton 
but it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be 
given other considerations  percent say it makes no difference 
meanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now 
why did james comey who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the clintons feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation 
opponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons 
they wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the clinton email negligence 
they will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it clinton isnt taking it gracefully 
clintons complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before 
this is from the telegraph  a uk publication 
hillary clinton was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the fbis bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails 
james comey announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material 
on saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put clinton  percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide down from  points just  days previously 
but wait  it gets better 
the clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr comey alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive and mrs clinton herself called the decision unprecedented and deeply troubling 
its pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election she complained addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the mustwin state of florida 
democrats questioned the timing of the agencys decision which comes as polls showed mrs clintons lead falling just  days before the presidential election 
this is like an wheeler smacking into us and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time said donna brazile the chairwoman of the democratic national committee 
the campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can 
we dont want it to knock us off our game but on the secondtolast weekend of the race we find ourselves having to tell voters keep your focus keep your eyes on the prize

Dean James,breaking trump just gave obama horrible news check out what the pentagon just did,"a lot of people in the us are suddenly identifying as white eric d knowles and linda r tropp quartz october   
many political commentators credit donald trumps rise to white voters antipathy toward racial and ethnic minorities however we believe this focus on racial resentment obscures another important aspect of racial thinking 
in a study of white americans attitudes and candidate preferences we found that trumps success reflects the rise of white identity politicsan attempt to protect the collective interests of white voters via the ballot box whereas racial prejudice refers to animosity toward other racial groups white identity reflects a sense of connection to fellow white americans 
were not the first to tie trumps candidacy to white identity politics  but our data provide some of the clearest evidence that ongoing demographic changes in the united states are increasing white racial identity white identity in turn is pushing white americans to support trump 
white identity 
when we talk about white identity were not referring to the altright fringe the white nationalist movement or others who espouse racist beliefs rather were talking about everyday white americans who perhaps for the first time are racially conscious 
snip 
nonhispanic whites are projected to become a minority in the year  this increasing diversity across the country is making whites own race harder and harder to ignore snip 
trump and white identity politics 
as whites increasingly sense that their status in society is falling  white racial identity is becoming politicized trumps promise to make america great again speaks to these anxieties by recalling a past in which white people dominated every aspect of politics and society snip 
snip 
to test our ideas about trump and white identity politics we surveyed a nationally representative sample of about  white americans the survey covered racial identities attitudes and political preferences in examining the relationship between white identity and ethnic diversity we chose to focus on an ethnic minority of particular salience in contemporary politics hispanics snip 
do whites from heavily hispanic neighborhoods show stronger white racial identity to measure identity we used a widelyused questionnaire  on a fivepoint scale participants rated their agreement with items such as being a white person is an important part of how i see myself and i feel solidarity with other white people as shown in the graph below there is a positive relationship between exposure to hispanics and white respondents sense of racial identity 
and does white identity lead to support for donald trump we examined the relationship between white identity and respondents likelihood of supporting trump for the presidency versus hillary clinton or several republican primary challengers consistent with others analyses  white identity strongly predicts a preference for trump 
whites at the high end of the racial identity scale are more than four times as likely to support trump than those at the low end of the scale perhaps thats because whites highest in racial identity are also the ones most likely to harbor negative attitudes against latinos indeed we found white identity was significantly correlated with another characteristicprejudice 
however differences in prejudice dont explain the relationship between white identity and trump support the pattern in the figure above was tested while statistically controlling for levels of antihispanic prejudice because the relationship between identity and support for trump remains strong we are confident that white identity independently predicts greater trump support 
weve seen that living close to hispanics leads whites to develop a strong sense of racial identity and that strong racial identity is associated with support for donald trump we should therefore expect that whites in heavily hispanic neighborhoods support trump more often than those in neighborhoods with fewer hispanics this prediction gains credence from work by political scientist ryan enos who finds that everyday exposure to latinos can increase support for restrictive immigration policies 
whites support for donald trump is in fact greatest in areas with a large hispanic population

Karl Simanonok,no title," shares
   
coming this weekend over  million pilgrims will rally in the holy city of karbala to mark the greatest pilgrimage of all  arbaeen right at the heart of iraq surrounded by the terror of the black flag army it is communities of men which will gather in prayers and in mourning to perform the last rites of imam hussain ibn ali the grandson of the prophet muhammad
while arbaeen has eclipsed even the hajj in terms of attendance few  even within islam have ever heard of the pilgrimage let alone the tragedy it recalls never mind the principles it saw enacted
arbaeen it needs to be said stands very much an offense to wahhabism  this dogma the house of saud has furiously promoted to assert its ascent to power arbaeen it needs to be emphasised actually speaks of this eternal struggle in between good and evil freedom and slavery piety and dogmatism
 sidelined by mainstream media for it speaks of islams attachment and commitment to such values as justice freedom and compassion towards all men and all fashion of faiths arbaeen has nevertheless towered a beacon of hope amid the furious rise of radicalism arbaeen i would personally argue has become a grand symbol of resistance against oppression  the coming together of communities beyond their differences and most importantly perhaps in spite of their differences so that together they could oppose tyranny and offer the oppressed a rampart behind which to find refuge
for those of you who still have no idea what in the world i am talking about allow me to tell you the story of a man  a man whose courage resolute strength of character and yearning for truth have echoed across the centuries to inspire generations upon generations to think themselves free and to rise themselves independent from the yoke of tyranny
more messenger   muslims develop technology to promote religious unity against radicalism why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity shia muslims gather in dc for antiterror rally imam hussain ibn alis martyrdom in the plain of karbala over a millennium ago stands testimony to our collective struggle against injustice and though it is islams banner the third imam carried his message was a universal call for freedom  an immovable promise that real tragedy lies not in our failure to defeat tyrants but in our reluctance to oppose them
allow me to take you back a few centuries back when islams early history was still being written back when the name of the prophet muhammad was still murmured in the present tense through the lips of his progeny the house ahlulbayt
only a few decades after islams last prophets passed islam stood divided as a nationstate its religious sovereignty challenged by men of greed and oppression yazid ibn muawiyah was one of them  arguably the most barbaric of them all since he envisioned slaughter to be the legacy of his throne
as bigots brandished islam to rationalise their heresy and proclaim righteous exceptionalism before the abomination of their deeds imam hussain had no other choice but to march against yazid  even if alone for as long as there was breath in him it is justice he would command for all people
and so the imam marched on  from the holy city of mecca to the thendeserted plain of karbala he walked knowing death would be his fate and still he pushed on 
it is this determination to meet evil and not relent in the task which arbaeen speaks of most loudly it is allegiance loyalty and love pilgrims manifest into reality as they walk towards their imam united not faith but in their humanity
arbaeen you most likely were never told is not exclusive to islam arbaeen is neither shia nor sunni arbaeen is for all who dare think themselves free under god and in him seek refuge
and while arbaeen has long been associated to shia islam for its school of thought revolve around those very principles imam hussain consecrated with his death the pilgrimage stands not in opposition or rejection of any faith  quite the contrary since christians yezidis hussainis brahims alongside countless other religious denominations have year after year centuries after centuries come to karbala to remember
arbaeen is remembrance of hussain ibn ali remembrance of the word of god made complete through hussain the man the prophet muhammad called his son and whose leadership he commanded all believers to forever follow
if many failed in their allegiance for fear rendered them motionless before their imams calls hussains station in karbala has echoed ever since of a love so brilliant and unparalleled that all people all nations all faiths across time and space have found themselves compelled to walk the great walk of arbaeen  and through hussain ibn ali find their humanity
arbaeen i have to say speaks to the best of our humanity it is home after all to the best of humanity  martyr among all martyrs there has never been a day like hussains day  and though his name wahhabism has worked to bury under the rubbles of history karbala has remembered its imam with fierce loyalty
a city build around and for hussain ibn ali karbala is a declaration of allegiance to the house of the prophet  those extraordinary men and women whose hearts lips and prayers have spoken islam in wisdom and piety and without whom we would be orphans
every year without fail karbala has fervently commemorated its imam  even in oppression especially when in oppression
before the poison of radicalism karbala has offered generosity and compassion before brutal repression karbala has opened its doors and to all oppressed offered a shelter before the depravity of sectarianism karbalas pulpits have called upon men and women to hold to rope of allah never to disunite
a city surrounded by the evil of daesh karbala has never shun brighter
in the face of insane fanaticism imam hussains followers have never been braver
and so coming this november   karbala will let out a roar which will shook tyrants thrones karbala will offer all of its prayers and all of its devotion  hussains name will be etched on believers hearts tears of allegiance will flow fists will rise to the sky a promise that when called upon all will answer
islam today is best manifested in karbala since karbala shuns no one karbala today has put saudi arabia to shame since it has provided food and shelter to tens of millions of pilgrims  without expectation without any hope of a thank you
a city has proven more generous and compassionate in its destitution than saudi arabia in its wealth and might where the socalled custodians of islam have cried the weight of the hajj on their coffers karbala has provided beyond the mathematically feasible
in a few short days karbala will stop time once more  so that all could remember all martyrs are in fact alive and that the sons of hussain are still standing vigil",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,2.2264292892673696,8,2,6897,1180,4.819491525423729,1180.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,1.0366453655598915,1.0719084808483403,-0.266098924307874,1.1085666997738586,0.0042372881355932,0.0,0.0008474576271186,0,3,0.0,0.0090777447952585,0.9866,0.132,0.11,0.757,Positive,Very Strong

No Author,poll sexism was not a factor in hillarys loss  daily wire,"aaron bandler november   
presidentelect donald trump that is still a term that is surreal to a lot of people as he was not expected to win on tuesday what were the driving factors that propelled trump to the presidency how was he able to pull off such a stunning upset 
here are seven reasons why trump won 
 hillary clinton was unable to get the minority vote to turn out for her last night dems were calling the race a whitelash  wrong mitt won  of white vote trump won  minority voters didnt turn out  david french davidafrench november   
in fact trump was able to get a larger share of the minority vote than mitt romney did in  as the daily wire has explained  
unsurprisingly trump lost to clinton in the latino and black votes by margins of  percent to  percent and  percent and  percent respectively surprisingly this was better than romney fared among the aforementioned demographics in  as he lost both groups by margins of  percent to  percent and  percent to  percent respectively 
michael barone has noted that turnout fell in heavily black philadelphia cleveland detroit and milwaukee millennial generation turnout was tepid and trump carried white millennials by  points 
the enthusiasm was just not there for clinton 
 trump was able to pull in former obama voters according to the washington post  trump was able to win over onethird of the  counties that went for obama twice clinton was only able to win six of the  counties that didnt go for obama trump was better at obtaining crossover voters than clinton was 
so who are these former obama voters who voted for trump in  and what caused them to switch 
 these former obama voters felt that trump cared about them and the democrat party did not john daniel davidson explains in the federalist that clinton and the democrat party took the bluecollar working class whites in the rust belt for grantedexemplified by clintons pledge to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of businessand it was to their detriment the rust belt has been in economic decline for years but it has suffered greatly from the obama administrations regulations towards coal 
while the democrats wrote off the rust belt trump actually acknowledged their struggles and that was all it took 
trump was the first national political figure in generations who saw them acknowledged that they have been left behind that their cities and towns are in a state of persistent decline and promised to help out somehow writes davidson when youre used to being dismissed as bitter folks who cling to guns and religion as president obama did in  or denounced as deplorables and irredeemable as hillary clinton did during this election respect goes a long wayeven if there are no easy solutions from washington or anywhere else to the problems that plague your town 
 the fbi reopening its investigation into hillarys emails helped trump per redstate  author ed klein said on the steve malzberg show that clinton was sobbing inconsolably on election night and was blaming fbi director james comey reopening the investigation as well as obama for not stopping the investigation as to why she lost 
theres no question that the reopening of the investigation did considerably help trump as the polls severely tightened after the announcement poll numbers showed that the vast majority of americans felt that hillary was acting in an immoral manner the spotlight was off of trumps vulgar comments towards women and his sexual assault accusers and instead the focus was on clintons private email server but clinton is leaving out one major person who is responsible for her loss 
 hillary was a terrible candidate if clinton had been elected president she would have been the first elected president to have been the subject of numerous fbi investigations she broke the law by using her private email server to conduct official state department business and there was a lot of quid pro quo that occurred at the clinton foundation  clinton is robotic and devoid of charisma with a record in politics that is short of accomplishments but rich in failure sleaze and corruption basically clinton is an obama democrat without obamas charm according to jonah goldberg  
she may have been the only democratic candidate that could lose to trump and the democrats wanted to coronate her from the beginning they have no one to blame but themselves for president trump 
 the public no longer has any faith in the mediaand that includes latenight comics will rahn wrote at cbs news that the unbearable smugness of the clintonbiased media was offputting to a lot of voters as they sneered at trump supporters as stupid backward hicks while doing everything they could to prop up clinton trumps vitriol toward the press ended up benefiting him politically poll numbers reflect this as trust in the media has declined over the years rahn explains 
journalists increasingly dont even believe in the possibility of reasoned disagreement and as such ascribe cynical motives to those who think about things a different way we see this in the ongoing veneration of facts the ones peddled by explainer websites and data journalists who believe themselves to be curiously postideological 
that the explainers and data journalists so frequently get things hilariously wrong never invites the soulsearching youd think it would instead it all just somehow leads us to more smugness more meanness more certainty from the reporters and pundits faced with defeat we retreat further into our bubble assumptions left unchecked no its the voters who are wrong 
as a direct result we get it wrong with greater frequency out on the road we forget to ask the right questions we cant even imagine the right question we go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases the publics estimation of the press declines even further  fewer than oneinthree americans trust the press per gallup  which starts the cycle anew 
the same applies to latenight comics mollie hemingway writes in the federalist that jon stewart is partly responsible for the election of trump because of how he singlehandedly destroyed cnns crossfire resulting in a new age of hyperpolitical hyperliberal latenight comedy stewarts the daily show spawned stephen colbert john oliver trevor noah and several other lefty comics that perverted comedy into smarmy leftwing political lectures talking down to conservatives 
jon stewart is known for brutally deriding a show that featured people of differing views civilly discussing issues of the day writes hemingway he got that show killed and significantly strengthened the world where cultural elites engaged in groupthink mockery of those with whom they disagree the results include a further erosion of civility a decrease in americans ability to understand each other and their concerns and of all things presidentelect donald trump 
which all culminates into the main reason why trump was elected 
 americans are tired of being trashed by leftist elites ben shapiro explains  
trump won because many americans were sick of being told that they were the racists as barack obama and his department of justice stoked race riots in major cities around the country 
trump won because many americans were sick of watching other americans being destroyed for their supposed intolerance  for their religious beliefs for their unwillingness to label women men and men women for their support for traditional marriage or conservative political candidates 
trump won because many americans were tired of the medias constant harping on americas flaws  we were supposedly sexist racist and homophobic americans said that they did not believe the media and they were right to do so 
in other words the left has been tearing down america as a country infested with intolerant prejudicial bigots who are incapable of thinking for themselves and needed to rely on them on how to live their lives the people finally had had enough so they elected the man whom they felt best stuck it to the leftist elites tags",dailywire.com,Real,english,99.09687615386632,47.88118811881188,57,11,8047,1330,5.0,1330.0,-0.1516281557987176,0.1737735362073249,1.34090278550595,1.3070605993579103,-0.0879547624848666,1.3492165825704152,0.0007518796992481,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0011353958275139,-0.9975,0.088,0.131,0.781,Negative,Very Strong

KD7ONE,no title,"the greatest trick that feminism has pulled is to convince the masses that women are presently disadvantaged relative to men
it is true that at first glance men dominate every field from business to pokémon go achievements  which can lead some to think that there is a conspiracy against women but the male superiority in many fields is exactly what allows society to prosper years after the humiliating debunking of the wage gap its time to address the real elephant in the room the fact that women dont pay taxes
a research report on the fiscal contribution of men and women across age groups was published by the victoria university of wellington  lets explore the key findings

this is the wellknown earnings gap incorrectly referred to as the wage gap womens preference for low paying jobs among others is a factor at play here another factor is the amount of women working part time the average week for women in this research was  hours and  for men the workforce participation rate did not differ between men and women in significant ways

this is the disposable income this is the income remaining after deduction of taxes and other mandatory charges available to be spent or saved as one wishes you can see that progressive taxes unfairly impact males  and reduces males disposable income near womens although the market income was almost double that of womens if it disproportionately affects men  you can be assured that no one will complain

those are the raw taxes paid by men and women the tax gap has oddly never been an gender issue until now

when the tax money received by men and women is included in the equation you can see that for most of womens lives except between  to  they receive more tax money than they supply the state with men on the other hand give the state more tax money than they receive from  to  years

this is where it gets upsetting as you can see womens short period of positive fiscal impact doesnt come close to counterbalance an already massive overall negative impact the net fiscal incidence on men is approximately zero when accumulated over all ages as such society invests in young males and they subsequently pay back societys investment women bear massive costs to society while we were taught to see them as underprivileged
by the end of her life the average woman will cost about  to the average taxpayer this means that an average man is extorted  in his lifetime that will be directly transferred to women if men could use that money to their will women would chase men as much as men chase women nowadays
there are a few confounds that need to be ruled out the authors mention specifically that health and education costs are almost equal for men and women also the workforce percentage doesnt exceed  difference between men and women women dont spend more for children either according to the report even if there were confounds that needed to be accounted for this is not something feminists have done for the cent wage gap they have compared raw percentages without accounting for any confounding factors
also these numbers do not include massive costs for the governmental budget for womens issues that is a massive burden for the state for instance my local government from a canadian province of  million people just announced a  plan to fight sexual violence against women  after two immigrants dingdongditched women in a student house 
add to that millions invested in sexed programs in which a feminist teaches boys that porn movies tailored for them shouldnt be imitated and that instead that they should have their partners pleasure in mind while teaching the exact opposite to girls the government takes money from males to empower women into hating men and their contribution to society
httpstcornbrpfws québec canada announces  million plan against sexual violence after two foreigners touched female students
 nicolas kilsdonk nkgervais october   

the data also doesnt include all the money directly and personally transferred from a man to a woman for instance while women make so little they still account for  of all consumer purchases  and you were wondering why marketers so desperately try to appeal to women in advertisements
a metaphor for male taxpayers and women this is a real danone ad watch it here or see my comment here 
the only defense that feminists can use when confronted with these facts is that women invest so much time in children however feminists made it very clear in the past decades that a womans contribution to society shouldnt be based on her involvement with children moreover at birth rates of half the necessary  birthrate for population stability theyre also doing the children thing pretty badly
these findings raise a serious question would feminism survive a libertarian regime that doesnt involve male tax money after all it is not a coincidence that women consistently vote for a welfare state within  years of womens suffrage in the usa the government doubled their tax expenditure and revenue  womens voting patterns have made the government become the new providing husband but this time the providing husband doesnt get a woman or children in return remove taxes and no woman will ever claim to be a strong independent woman the state is cucking you a little like if prostitution was not only legal but free  most guys would probably be strong independent single males
pretty ironic that the institution that gives money to women for being pregnant prevents them from being paid less makes abortions affordable is entirely supported by men feminists are not seriously against living in a society entirely supported by men they are just against men having the autonomy over the wealth they create male wealth is a public good and female wealth is her body her choice
its time we fight for equal tax

Daniel Greenfield,fbi believes  foreign intel agencies got into hillarys server,"obamas doj issued stand down order on clinton foundation investigation november   
there have been various insider reports on the clinton foundation and the hillary email scandal on fox 
but the curious thing about this wall street journal report is that its clearly aimed at defending hillary clinton and smearing the fbi in the battle with obamas doj officials who wanted to shut it down due to their support of hillary clinton 
which means that its information that damns its own side gains more credibility 
justice department officials became increasingly frustrated that the agents seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions 
following the february meeting officials at justice department headquarters sent a message to all the offices involved to stand down a person familiar with the matter said 
a stand down order much like the one in libya 
and remember mccabe whose wifes democratic political campaign received major cash from a clinton ally 
amid the internal fingerpointing on the clinton foundation matter some have blamed the fbis no  official deputy director andrew mccabe claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer his defenders deny that and say it was the justice department that kept pushing back on the investigation 
not a surprise either 
the fbi had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a publiccorruption case talking about alleged deals the clintons made these people said the agents listening to the recordings couldnt tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate but it was they thought worth checking out 
fbi investigators grew increasingly frustrated with resistance from the corruption prosecutors and some executives at the bureau itself to keep pursuing the case 
as prosecutors rebuffed their requests to proceed more overtly those justice department officials became more annoyed that the investigators didnt seem to understand or care about the instructions issued by their own bosses and prosecutors to act discreetly 
and thats what blew up when team hillary lashed out at the fbi it was a covert war between hillarys doj allies and the fbi coming out of the cold and they pushed so hard even mccabe was disgusted 
as a result of those complaints these people said a senior justice department official called the fbi deputy director mr mccabe on aug  to say the agents in new york seemed to be disregarding or disobeying their instructions these people said the conversation was a tense one they said and at one point mr mccabe asked are you telling me that i need to shut down a validly predicated investigation the senior justice department official replied of course not

Daniel Greenfield,head of hillary transition project israel is depressing,"fbi releases files on bill clintons cash for pardons scandal november   daniel greenfield 
the fbi has an early present for hillary clinton its the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash that fugitive was a fellow by the name of marc rich his prosecutor james comey 
the fbi unexpectedly released  pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in  into president bill clintons pardon of marc rich who had been married to a wealthy democratic donor 
the unusual timing of the release was the result of a freedom of information act request that had been completed and was posted under standard fbi practice according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters but the clinton campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release 
well of course it did its never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you 
the investigation stemmed from one of several pardons clinton made on the last day of his presidency in  that of financier and international fugitive marc rich whose exwife denise had given to the democratic national committee and the entity that would later become the clinton foundation 
and theres a surprise guest 
while the files may seem dated they invoke figures beyond the clintons who went on to play key roles in official washington  including comey 
he served as prosecutor in charge of a legal case against rich from  to  as the us attorney in manhattan in  comey took over a criminal investigation of clintons pardons i was stunned at the rich pardon comey wrote in a letter to lawmakers in

A. Griffee,dml provides stunning analysis predicts trump will win presidential election,"by dean daniels  november    politics  
in the summer of  before the current presidential race ignited and two weeks before trump announced his candidacy dml gave a compelling speech during his tour in the state of massachusetts in front of an audience at a small town synagogue the awardwinning businessman and conservative commentator laid out the key component that he believed would catapult any presidential candidate above all the others putting americans first 
dml emphasizes during his americans first speech that the number one issue in america is immigration he explains in crystal clear detail how immigration both legal and illegal goes beyond party identification he says its not a democrat or republican issue  its an american issue 
having traveled the country by car exploring the idea of running for president himself dml got a real sense for what concerned americans most therefore he knew before the rest of us that the ideal candidate of  would be someone who has the audacity and the courage to tell the american people he or she will commit to the deportation of illegal immigrants 
remember its not an antiimmigration its an antiillegal immigration and its about being proamerica 
while putting americans first would have been dmls campaign theme had he chosen to run for the highest office in the land this strategy was instead adopted by none other than donald jtrump this is one major reason why dml has supported trump since day one 
trump has done more than proven dml correct trump has proven how powerful the  americans first ideology is during a day and age when progressive politicians like barack obama and hillary clinton are catering to foreign workers and corporate donors at the expense of the american people who are left to rot on the back burner

Henry Wolff,hispanic crowd boos marco rubio off stage,"students to protest mikado for lack of engagement with controversial past derek g xiao harvard crimson october   
a group of asian american students is planning to protest the harvardradcliffe gilbert and sullivan players upcoming production of the mikado for how it handles the racial stereotypes that characterize traditional performances of the opera 
organized by george s qiao  the group of students had publicized their protest over various email lists describing what they consider inadequate attempts to remove the japanese stereotypes and appropriation of japanese culture that remained latent in the adapted productions storyline but later qiao said that he thought the tone of his initial concerns was unfair to the players 
i fully believe that members of the gilbert and sullivan players put their blood sweat and tears into trying to improve this staging of the production qiao said however i believe that there is still insufficient critical engagement with this plays history of japanese cultural misrepresentation 
penned in  the mikado is a comical opera set in the fictional japanese town of titipu and meant to satirically mask criticism of british political culture and bureaucracy with grossly exaggerated asian names and stereotypical cultural caricatures 
snip hoping to avoid these issues in their own production the board of the gilbert and sullivan players made some changes to the setting and script of the opera characterizing their rendition as a reimagining of the original production 
the board of the harvardradcliffe gilbert  sullivan players whose mission is to produce the full canon of gilbert and sullivans shows faced a dilemma this past january kathleen c zhou  the president of the players wrote in an oped for the crimson tuesday strike the mikado from our season and ignore one of the most problematic but wellknown gs shows or try to confront it by reimagining it and subverting authorial intent 
the setting of their show is no longer the th century town of titipu and instead is now th century las vegas themed oriental hotel and the opening number gentlemen of japan has been rewritten as gentlemen of the strip 
snip 
zhou said in an interview that in rethinking the comical operas script the complete omission of all of the original productions issues was an erasure in itself in that it does not acknowledge how problematic the show has been to asians

Don Wrightman,the rothschild family has corrupted global banks news media oil and government,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat oct th  at  am if she gets elected on november th this isnt going away so what needs to happen special prosecutor she cant investigate herself as the presidentelect   
president barack obama did not have to do anything wrong for republicans to want to throw him in jail or to impeach him hillary clinton doesnt have to have done anything wrong either apparently for congress to appoint a special prosecutor to take her down once elected  because a bunch of emails had nothing to do with her  
at least that and completely ignoring the facts was the theme on fox news last night though to be fair other mainstream media outlets werent much better yesterday 
megyn kelly fresh from a stint of pretending to be a feminist in a faceoff with newt gingrich suggested to chairman of the house judiciary committee bob goodlatte rwv that given the fbi revelations of a complete lack of evidence that hillary clinton has done anything wrong what needs to happen is a special prosecutor 
megyn kelly  let me ask you this if she gets elected on november th this isnt going away so what needs to happen a special prosecutor she cant investigate herself as the presidentelect bob goodlatte  well first of all we have said from the outset that the house judiciary committee would follow the truth wherever it leads and we have done that throughout the summer asking a number of questions about how this investigation by the fbi was being conducted we will continue to do that we dont know whats going to happen now we dont know whats going to happen after the election so its pure speculation what will happen afterwards a special prosecutor remember is appointed by the attorney general of the united states so you have to decide whether thats going to be a fairer investigation than the one being conducted by the fbi under the direction of director comey right now and the judiciary committee will certainly stay engaged in this and continue our investigation 
democracy is a fragile thing it is to goodlattes credit that he declined the call to draw up articles of impeachment in  and that he cautioned megyn kelly that a special prosecutor is appointed not by the house but by the attorney general however the gopled house has been far too engaged already in undermining our democracy 
what holds this country together is an idea and an agreement among all parties that it works republicans have decided it only works if theyre in charge and this has brought us to the point where we threaten to jail our adversaries appoint special prosecutors if they win or vote to impeach them outright as trumps pet snake at cnn jeffrey lord called for last night  
two points anderson one with  days left this makes donald trumps argument exactly to the point here you sum up the argument in terms of her judgment her paranoia and all of the rest the second thing anderson is and this is the really disturbing thing lets just say for the sake of the argument she wins the election this isnt going to stop there will be a move to impeach her the moment her hand comes down from that bible this is going to go on and on and on and on and frankly i mean thats something the american people need to consider now 
it is not difficult to see where this will lead hillary clinton has committed no crimes far from being a miscarriage of justice though it is that as well this is a miscarriage of reason and sanity 
this sort of talk is just further evidence that donald trump comes from the same vile brew as paul ryan and mitch mcconnell and the rest of the party during the mccarthy era the house took it upon itself to be both judge and jury last night it was fox news egging the house on for more of the same

ken wressler  a retired steelworker says he was glad to move back into the house in which he was born here after working in the steel mill in nearby mandan for more than  years 
earlier thursday standing on his porch to have his morning coffee he said he doesnt much see the sense of blocking the  billion oil pipeline under construction through four states by energy transfer partners of dallas texas it cuts a swath of freshlyturned ground just a mile from his house 
the construction is protected by razor wire on a highway overpass a reminder of the protests that have drawn international attention about a half hour from wresslers house near the standing rock sioux reservation 
they aint bothered us here in st anthony wressler said but im afraid something is going to happen for the worst if they are not going to move and they are going to get moved he said of protesters now encamped in the path of construction he said the sheriff should have taken a stronger stance from the beginning but who knows 
north dakota needs the pipeline he said as a former steel worker he knows the value of the oil industry 
during the first boom in  we made tanks and more oil tanks and more tanks today what good is oil to north dakota if we cant send it somewhere what do we want to get it from the arabs we see how many problems that gave us 
its been a good life wressler said in this faded town that used to have two schools a lumber yard grocery store and a post office the bigger town of mandan up the road sucked off the jobs and population but he values the roots he feels deep in this ground his father used to work in the shed next to his wresslers house as a blacksmith fixing farmers tools he pounded and fixed everything until they moved to throwaway scythes throwaway everything 
wresslers red plaid flannel shirt with white plastic pearl snaps was all he needed to be comfortable on this fall morning everybody wanted an early winter the pipeline people wanted it so the indians would leave the indians wanted it so they couldnt put in the pipeline instead weve got this

call it the crisis of whiteness 
white anxiety has fueled this years political tumult in the west britains surprising vote to exit the european union donald j trumps unexpected capture of the republican presidential nomination in the united states the rise of rightwing nationalism in norway hungary austria and greece 
whiteness in this context is more than just skin color you could define it as membership in the ethnonational majority but thats a mouthful what it really means is the privilege of not being defined as other 
whiteness means being part of the group whose appearance traditions religion and even food are the default norm its being a person who by unspoken rules was long entitled as part of us instead of them 
snip 
its fundamentally about who are we said eric kaufmann a professor of politics at birkbeck college university of london what does it mean to be part of this nation is it not our nation anymore our meaning the ethnic majority 
these kinds of questions are really front and center even though theyre not necessarily verbalized 
the questions can seem like a sudden reversal after decades of rising multiculturalism through the civil rights movement in the united states and the european unions opening up of borders 
snip 
white peoples officially privileged status waned over the latter half of the th century with the demise of discriminatory practices in say university admissions but rising wages an expanding social safety net and new educational opportunities helped offset that most white adults were wealthier and more successful than their parents and confident that their children would do better still 
that feeling of success may have provided a sort of identity in itself 
but as western manufacturing and industry have declined taking many workingclass towns with them parents and grandparents have found that the opportunities they once had are unavailable to the next generation 
that creates an identity vacuum to be filled 
for someone who is lower income or lower class professor kaufmann explained youre going to get more selfesteem out of a communal identity such as ethnicity or the nation than you would out of any sort of achieved identity 
snip 
a recent gallup study found that mr trumps supporters tend to earn aboveaverage incomes for their communities but also tend to live in majoritywhite areas where children are likely to be worse off than their parents 
snip 
the formal rejection of racial discrimination in those societies has by extension constructed a new broader national identity the united states has a black president london has a muslim mayor of pakistani descent 
but that broadening can to some feel like a painful loss articulated in the demand voiced over and over at trump rallies probrexit events and gatherings for populist parties throughout europe i want my country back 
the mantra is not all about bigotry rather being part of a culture designed around peoples own community and customs is a constant background hum of reassurance of belonging 
the loss of that comforting hum has accelerated a phenomenon that robin diangelo a lecturer and author calls white fragilitythe stress white people feel when they confront the knowledge that they are neither special nor the default that whiteness is just a race like any other 
fragility leads to feelings of insecurity defensiveness even threat and it can trigger a backlash against those who are perceived as outsiders 
snip 
for decades the language of white identity has only existed in the context of white supremacy when that became taboo it left white identity politics without a vocabulary 
if you are a workingclass white person and you fear that the new cosmopolitan world will destroy or diminish an identity you cherish you have no culturally acceptable way to articulate what you perceive as a crisis 
some of these people have instead reached for issues that feel close to their concerns trade crime the war on drugs controlling the borders fear of islamist terrorism all are significant in their own right and create very real fears for many people but they have also become a means to have a public conversation about what societys changes mean for white majorities 
snip 
there will not likely be a return to the whiteness of social dominance and exclusive national identity immigration cannot be halted without damaging western nations economies immigrants who have already arrived cannot be expelled en masse without causing social and moral damage and the other groups who seem to be cutting in line are in fact getting a chance at progress that was long denied them 
western whites have a place within their nations new broader national identities but unless they accept it the crisis of whiteness seems likely to continue",amren.com,Fake,english,16.093066489392562,11.326876277819148,63,11,4815,791,5.049304677623262,791.0,0.0318220802597783,0.1737735362073249,0.4858071496227662,0.4620806535135225,-0.0392958810125828,0.4844813370547888,0.0075853350189633,0.0,0.0012642225031605,0,5,0.0,0.0178958225428693,0.4493,0.127,0.116,0.757,Positive,Moderate
Activist Post,mark ruffalo delivers mobile solar trailers to standing rock camps in preparation for harsh winter,"by jon rappoport 
i begin this piece with three quotes from my workinprogress the underground 
there is a media metaphysics its basic principle states that nothing exists until it becomes information now we have a new twist information only becomes real when it reaches a mind already attuned to it in other words the tree falling in the forest makes a sound only if a userconsumer who wants a tree to fall receives video and audio of the event 
information can be dressed up a thousand different ways but it tends to have an elastic quality by that i mean you eventually get to see the person who dressed it up thats a problem for chronic liars who inhabit the press they expose themselves even though they dont want to it takes a surprisingly small push to expose the whole operation this is happening now right in front of our eyes 
the basis of big media is theater news is theater its directors and producers think theyre doing a firstrate job but theyre sadly mistaken gaps and obfuscations are growing larger the outright nonsequiturs and gibberish are becoming more apparent the audience is wising up to the farce who are these fools who direct the news theyre simply people who want to sell their souls and have found an elite buyer but that transaction doesnt contain any guarantees about shelf life mainstream news is decaying and the expiration date is approaching like civilizations the petty princes of information rise and fall 
globalized media its nice plan lets examine it 
the new technocratic media is based on profiling users there is no impactful news unless each member of the audience is surveilled and analyzed on the basis of what he already likes and wants 
shocking its to be expected how else would technocrats parlay the untold hours theyve spent sizing up their consumersusers 
several years ago i wrote tech blather has already begun since jeff bezos ceo of amazon bought the washington post at a fire sale jeff genius will invent new ways to transmit the news to people on the go and make the post a smashing success mobile devices multiple platforms digital taking over from print ads customized to fit readers interests profiling news stories customized to fit readers interests more profiling 
in other words nonnews if you thought media were irrelevant and deceptive before you havent seen anything the new news will create millions of virtual bubbles in which profiled users can float contentedly under the cozy cottage roofs of their favorite little separate paradigms 
the tech giant apple has waded into this territory with an app that will deliver news to users yahoo apple news part of the upcoming ios  operating system aims to be the primary news source for users of the iphone and ipad apple says its news app follows over a million topics and pulls relevant stories based on your specific interests joshua benton of the nieman journalism lab said the app will be important because through the awesome power of default apple distribution puts it in an entirely other league this news app will be on hundreds of millions of devices within  hours of its debut 
translation profiling their users down to their toenails apple will present them with virtual bubbles of news they want to see and read 
not just one overall presentation for all no different news outlets for apples audiences 
this introduces a whole new layer of mind control 
youre an obama fan here are stories confirming your belief in the prophet 
you want neocon on the rocks with a conservative republican twist heres some war footage thatll warm your heart 
do you believe government gridlock is our biggest concern congress cant get anything done weve got headlines for that from here to the moon 
tuned into celeb gossip heres your world in three minutes 
the idea convince users one day at a time that what they already believe is important is the news of the day 
its decentralized centralization one media giant carving its global audience up into little pieces and delivering them a whole host of different algorithmically appropriate lies and fluff and nocontext psyops 
and for fringe users youre doubtful about gmos well look at what whole foods is planning for their healthier produce section cheer up nothing about maui voters declaring a temporary ban on devastatingly toxic monsantodow experiments or the dangers of roundup youre antivaccine sorry you dont count youre not a recognized demographic but heres a piece about a little unvaccinated boy who was involved in car crash on the i 
does this sound like science fiction it isnt its the mainstream look of the nearfuture search engines are already personalizing your inquiries us abc national news is climbing in the ratings because its giving viewers lighter stories and spending less time on thorny issues like the middle east 
the mainstream news business is desperately looking for audience and treating every user as a profiled socialconstructbundle of superficial preferences is their answer 
mr x weve studied the little virtual bubble you live in and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth 
hello audience were going to pitch you on becoming fullfledged obsessed consumers as if there is no other worthy goal in lifeand then were going to profile you from top to bottom to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands 
the onetwo punch 
any actual event occurring in the world will be predigested by robot media editors and profilers and then split up into variously programmed bits of information for different audiences 
who cares what really happened in the new world there is no what really happened thats a gross misnomer a faulty idea a metaphysical error no there is only a multiforked media tongue that simultaneously spits out a dozen or a hundred variations of the same eventbecause different viewers want and expect different realities 
in   orwells big brother was issuing a single voice into the homes of the population that was oldschool that was primitive technology that was achieving unity by hammering unity into peoples skulls this now is the frontier of unity through diversity 
we want to make all of you into androids through basic pr and propaganda and a pathetic excuse for education however we recognize youll become different varieties of androids and well serve that outcome with technological sophistication trust us we care about what you prefer

user d that wasnt a border war it was a drill and then afterwards these cops gave a demonstration of all their gear vests shields communication devices flashbangs auto rifles with silencers batons i watch drills all over the country love them 
user e chula vista the only thing i saw on the news was sunny and mild this week i watch all the weather channels i love them 
but when a big one comes along like the  national election in the us the separate tunes come together and ring as one then the overriding need to extend globalisms goals in the person of hillary clinton blot out every other priority then the major media twist whatever they need to twist then its the same bubble for everyone 
one problem though major media have been lanced thousands of times by alt news sites and by wikileaks and project veritas this attack has exposed the truth and the clinton crimes 
and alt news reflects the growing interest of the public in whats actually happening on many fronts 
the technocratic plan for the news is failing 
it was a nice plan but 
its turning out to be a dud 
alt media are forcing public awareness of one giant scandal after another hillaryobama support for isis provaccine liars the collapse of obamacare the gmo hustle pesticide damageon and on and on 
the result major media are being backed into a corner where they must defend lies and build monolithic lies for everyone all the time the idea of creating separate news for each profiled user is collapsing 
major media are playing defense against the rest of the world 
its quite a party 
and it has no expiration date 
a final note trump wikileaks project veritas drudge and many alt news sites created a perfect storm in  raining down on major media it was and is unprecedented the mainstream press has been exposed down to its roots as never before the lying the collusion the arrogant sense of entitlement the desperation the corruptionits all there to see for anyone who has eyes and a few working brain cells expect more to come regardless of the outcome of the election the train has really left the station

in last weeks newspaper there was a report on the tenth or eleventh woman i have lost track to come forward to say that donald trump made suggestive and inappropriate advances to her during a golf tournament that took place about ten years ago 
the woman in question is jessica drake who during her press conference announced that at the time of the tournament she was working in the the adult industry thats what people magazine calls porn for wicked pictures the th century fox of gang banging when the randy donald kissed and hugged her in his room 
trump was already in his pajamas when she knocked on his door together with two friends normally in the adult business when three porn stars knock on your hotel door its considered foreplay 
when trumps effusive greeting of miss drake did not lead to more snuggling let alone the suggestion to preview some of her work on the hotel television he offered her  to satisfy his suite dreams 
drake again demurred saying that the next morning she needed to get back to los angeles for work by that point in her career she had already notched screen credits for extreme doggie and fornocopia i would mention other titles but as they say at the new york post  this is a family newspaper 
that rejection prompted donald to offer jessica an early morning ride of shame on his trump airliner back to la which still didnt turn the trick    
then last week in the presence of her lawyer gloria allred the perry mason of many cases against bill cosby miss drake tearfully repeated in primetime her shock and dismay that mr trump had tried to take liberties with her reputation which after all includes the  adult video news award for the best double penetration sex scene in her classic work fallen 
drake said she was coming forward now to stand in solidarity with the other women trump has manhandled although there were suggestions that her outing was timed to coincide with the launch of drakes new online store where devoted viewers can purchase such classics as her guide to bdsm for beginners among other titles 
normally scenes such as the one i am describing would be consigned to john oliver monty python or saturday night live  but in the new normal of presidential politics even miss drake gets a respectful hearing on the issues 
for example the next day the huffington post reported woman says trump sexually assaulted her offered her  for sex 
the deadpan new york times wrote ms drake who appeared saturday with the womens rights lawyer gloria allred said mr trump had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission 
the headline in new york magazine read adult actress jessica drake details trump assault blasts him for uncontrollable misogyny 
look i have no doubt that trump is a pig who routinely gropes and propositions women but since when does the press in a presidential election have to source its stories in the adult industry    
sadly the answer to this question dates to winter  when bill and hillary clinton figured out that unless a presidential candidate has a sexual storyline few of the voters will pay much attention to their positions on nuclear disarmament or welfare reform 
during the  super bowl the clintons appeared on a halftime special of  minutes to deny jointly bill that allegation is false  that he had ever had an affair with gennifer flowers who lived in little rock arkansas when bill was governor and often out jogging 
in this vaudeville performance hillary played the straight man adding you know im not sitting heresome little woman standing by my man like tammy wynette at least she didnt reference the eagles 
only in  under oath in a sworn deposition did bill admit to having a year affair with ms flowers but neither her allegations in  nor his lying about it cost him the election that year 
just the opposite clintons wanderlust might have won him sympathy among the voters no strangers to sexual boredom who found they had more in common with a softshell baptist bill than an uptight protestant george hw bush 
nor did clintons impeachment in  for lying about his affair with monica lewinsky under oath in the paula jones case hurt his postpresidential career worth  million  or the electoral prospects of his wife in  
but it did turn sexuality into a mainstream presidential campaign issue which is one of the reasons why this years race seems only to be about sex    
no doubt the clintons do find some delicious irony in trumps groping charges as payback for what they view as the republican use of sexuality to impeach bill in  and in  for the gop plan to make his many adulterous affairs fair game for their campaign soundbites cut to an online image of the white house and over it a fading picture of bill smoking a cigar with the caption here we go again 
without the pageantloving casino operating donald trump as the republican nominee in  hillary clinton could well have been vulnerable on the sexual front with bills mistresses steady fodder for negatives ads and the many allegations from his scorned lovers that hillary organized the slutshaming 
instead of the  election turning on hillarys marriage to hugh hefners doppelgänger the storyline that has played best in the media is donalds secret life as a groper 
the press actually has given trump a pass for his adultery which produced all those wonderful children but zeroed in on his groping in part because he confessed to it on an nbc videotape and also becausethink of ratingsgropers belong in the same basket of deplorables as child abusers and others lurking on subways crowed elevators or near schoolyards 
best of all for the clintons politically anyway is that the charge of groping is impossible for trump to refute even denying it sounds sleazy 
and it colors all aspects of the campaign to wit the new york times headline when at gettysburg trump outlined his vision for america donald trump pledges to heal divisions and sue his accusers    
for its mudslinging i am sure the trump campaign has spent many long hours brainstorming how to tar hillary as a lesbian but even that innuendo has fallen flat despite the rumor mongering that shes in a boston marriage with her assistant huma abedin whose husband anthony weiner is otherwise distracted in high school chat rooms 
several of bills former lovers sally miller dolly kyle and flowers have tried to play up bills pillow talk that hillary prefers the nighttime company of women but none of these allegations have gone further than infowars or the supermarket press  hillary hit man tells all  
nor have outofwedlock children a staple of the  campaign as was chanted to grover cleveland  ma ma where  s my pa  gotten much play in this years presidential race 
trump and his casino gumshoes have put considerable effort into tracking down the rumor that danney williams is bill clintons illegitimate son by a little rock prostitute named bobbie ann williams 
trump invited danney a sympathetic man to the third presidential debate as if to press on bill a scarlet letter despite williams looking very much like president bill the story got no more traction than did the news that malik obama the presidents shunned halfbrother is supporting trump he too got a debate invitation to sit in the box presumably marked shame 
also in the dustbin of history are the allegations that flowers aborted bills baby in  and the whispering campaign a great political standby when proof is elusive that chelsea is the product of an affair between hillary and her then law firm colleague webb hubbell 
the williams and hubbell stories come with some convincing internet similarities at least in the photographs although in both cases politically this rumor milling whiplashed against trump as voters have only equated such tawdry allegations with his birther past something that has stuck as campaign mud    
technically birtherism doest directly involve sex although it lingers on its fringes as it speaks to barack obamas illegitimacy his foreign allegiances and possibly disputed paternity including the claim that frank marshall davis was actually obamas biological father another subterranean creed of trumpism 
again the documentary proof is a series of lookalike photographs as close as the internet gets to dna that davis was an american communist works well in the campaign as it suggests the origins of obamas political genetic code 
ironically for all his efforts at smear trump came out the loser in the debates when hillary nailed him to birtherism which has become a convenient code word for trumps racism misogyny and intolerance of immigrants especially muslims 
nor in response did trump have any luck in linking the birther movement to clintons  campaign when according to donald consiglierejournalist sidney blumenthal delighted in the suggestion that barack was born in kenya 
instead the debate claim only made trump look disingenuous clinton got a pass on what her campaign may or may not have insinuated in  and at this point no one cares but voters do remember trump as the imperial wizard of birtherism    
republicans can only blame themselves for wanting to divide the electorate in  along lines of sexual preference or deviance although this strategy was based on hillary being the democratic nominee and anyone other than trump standing for the republicans 
had the gop nominee been carly fiorina jeb bush or john kasich clinton inc might well have been vulnerable to possible storylines about infidelity illegitimacy and rape cue up the paula jones description of bill during a business meeting exposing himself in a little rock hotel and settling her lawsuit for  
instead the republicans went with the polyamorous trump who in addition to three marriages has bragged on morning radio about his success with young women and who since  has been leering at miss universe contestantsa bit like austin powers  shall we shag now or shall we shag later  
with trumps resumé of creepy perversion you might have thought that the republicans would drop sexual misconduct from the electoral playbook instead they doubled down to make the case that both clintons if elected would turn the white house into a strip club 
not only did the clintons shrug off such innuendo but in response they said in effect if they did it would be to cater to the likes of players such as donald j trump leisure suit and open collar optional    
for the momentand i cant see anything changing in the last days of the campaignthe accepted wisdom of most front pages is that donald trump has groped as many women as tiger woods has watched pole dancing in vegas even the gallery of their women looks about the same 
conversely few voters seem to care that bill might have forced himself on several women or that hillary helped to cover up his brutality thats a narrative of the s which is perhaps the last time austin danger trump read the newspaper  ive been frozen for  years ive got to see if my bits and pieces are still working  
for most voters in  names such as kathleen willey or juanita broaddrick are as lost in time as nan britton who just before the  election bore a love child with then candidate senator warren harding 
britton and the child got republican hush money and a sad little house in asbury park new jersey after harding won she was invited to the white house but their affair so to speak was kept in the closet    
if you think about elections as political sitcoms in  the kennedys had to run as rob and laura petrie on the dick van dyke show  complete with twin beds long flannel pajamas and prudent kisses on the cheek to say goodnight even if the jfk reality show would make trump bill clinton and tiger look like apprentices at adultery 
come  only something that resembles modern family and a desperatehousewives reality show can crack network primetime and who better to put on air than the clintons with their dallas like money communal sexuality and more illicit storylines than csi  
for more than twenty years bill and hillary have been bringing us seasons of lust affairs ididnothavesexwiththatwoman vince foster travelgate foundation slush funds basement servers commodity trading whitewater bosnian snipers paytoplay benghazi lost emails and the like and the ratings only continue to go up

the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco has approved a motion that endorses the right of the palestinians to the alaqsa mosque compound and slams israeli provocations around the holy site 
unescos member world heritage committee adopted the resolution in wednesdays secret ballot at the agencys headquarters in paris 
ten countries voted for two against eight abstained and one was absent in the voting 
the resolution expresses unescos deep concerns over israeli construction works and archaeological excavations in the old city of jerusalem alquds 
saeb erekat the secretary general of the palestine liberation organization welcomed the passage of the motion and accused the tel aviv regime of resorting to a campaign of distorting facts in a bid to legitimize its occupation of east jerusalem alquds 
through an orchestrated campaign israel has been using archaeological claims and distortion of facts as a way to legitimize the annexation of occupied east jerusalem erekat said 
he further noted that the unesco resolution urges respecting the status quo of its religious sites including the alaqsa mosque compound that continues to be threatened by the systematic incitement and provocative actions of the israeli government and extremist jewish groups 
earlier this month unescos member executive board approved a similar resolution prompting a furious reaction from israel as the regime suspended its ties with the agency

Admin,swedish mp quits in disgust at jewish ownership of media  includes short video by red ice radio,"by m jaggers ld we discussed yesterday the various reasons why trump won the election mr jaggers thinks trump won because he promoted the interests of the vast underclass of disenfranchised whites who were sick to death of the neoconservative liberal elites as typified by the loathsome hillary clinton it is in trumps own interests jaggers believes not to betray the whites who voted for him by reneging on his promises there must be no uturns no cuddling up to the zionist enemy no wishywashy compromises or backslidings trump is now expected to make america great again  or else a tall order well see ld 
 in certain times there is a surreal feeling of being a part of history which is perhaps to say we are living in a time period of dynamic change however unthinkable for the left it may be trump has been elected we can add this to brexit and other unthinkable events to come to contemplate the details of what this may entail such as the selection of cabinet members and policy priorities  which do indeed include building that wall has something of a christmas morning feelingeveryday 
to paraphrase an from die welt  in western democracies the status quo seems stable and it is not generally considered possible for extremes to transpire but that is what we have seen however we may want to quibble about what exactly is extreme can donald trump or the altright for that matter be considered extreme after that electoral show of consent regardless when there is an endless back and forth between stultifying uncourageous republicans and the frankly antiwhite agenda of the democrats extreme does not carry such a negative connotation but instead implies a kind of deliverance 
we have been locked in a middleclass complaisance and that is precisely why societies such as ours are often surprised by the foreseeable and obvious and alas though it may be unspeakable to liberals and though he was the object of such ridicule in our media trump is now the most powerful man in the world as die welt puts it perhaps with some apprehension just let that sink in explanatory factors 
trumps appeal may have been equally a reaction to black lives matter protests as to immigration according to exit polls  percent of trump voters feel that blacks are treated fairly by the criminal justice system which by definition means that these voters are not sympathetic to black lives matter overall half of white voters democrats and republicans opined that blacks are treated fairly by police likely most of us will have anecdotal evidence that our nonaltright family members and acquaintances were not amused by black lives matter trump voters were especially unamused 
of trump supporters  percent favor building the wall on the southern border compared to less than half of all voters  percent oppose  percent favor so antipathy towards both black lives matter and immigration can be said to have catapulted trump to the presidency  in part by turning off mainstream middleclass white people who are normally content with the statusquo moderates may not want a wall per se  but they also may not complain too loudly when its being built and again trumps actual voters want it builtunequivocally 
while losing some steam amongst collegeeducated whites trump won the white working class by  points  an increase from romneys  point spread ultimately there is no simple narrative that emerges trump increased white support in different key swing states from different rural and suburban demographics in order to dominate the electoral college i wont pretend to be nate silver so lets just say he won because of white people 
among his supporters opines thomas friedman on real time with bill maher  this was  percent about race and the other  percent was about race 
good then lets accept the premise of liberals and draw the necessary conclusions if trump triumphed on the basis of race issues he now has a mandate on immigration law and order the wall etc 
for the nytimes david brooks holding forth on public broadcasting service pbs trump voters are just going with their gene pool  a rather bald statement that trump voters are voting their ethnic interests after the election brooks predicted that the country would be split into two factions with one faction advocating ethnic separatism what many on the alt right are already advocating would that it were so 
nixon became known to history as the law and order candidate which accurately characterized his proclivities visàvis crime trump on the other hand to leave no doubt selfidentified as the law and order candidate as liberals will complain and as the altright will readily admit law and order is understood to mean that we will not tolerate black violence and civil unrest trumps support therefore was premised on his intolerance for the very violence which his election has provoked once again from blacks and other malcontent minorities in the protests following his victory which continue as i write this 
it is ironic that blacks report feeling scared at the prospect of the trump presidency while they are in fact the progenitors of violence and so far as i know trump never made any negative statements explicitly about blacks their violence and disorder has indeed scared the rest of civil society contributing to trumps election perhaps blacks are expressing their fear by attacking innocent whites in this inverted reality how can we assuage these sensitive blacks sense of fear shall we become human punching bags you cant always get what you want 
if there is one thing that minorities have learned over the last eight years it is that they get what they want and whites perhaps as a natural corollary do not hence the indignation following this surprise victory 
some journalists noted with amusement that trump often played the rolling stones you cant always get what you want at his campaign rallies i hypothesized that trump liked the song for its beautiful choral section which has a celestial quality that built anticipation for his arrival on stage surely he paid little heed to the message of the lyrics which discordantly seemed to suggest he was voters second choice but now it all makes sense i suggest that for our underprivileged people of color its time you learned you cant always get what you want 
not only is the people of color poc attitude of entitlement and aggrievement ridiculous it is also presumptuous 
while the msm claims that the onus is now on trump to reach out to those who didnt vote for him ie blacks and hispanics it would seem that he was given a mandate to serve the interests of those who did vote for him  it follows logically that he would now carry that project through and enact the policies which mobilized his base and put him in the oval office sourced from the occidental observer like this share it now  thoughts on  trump won because of white people  györgy says november   at  am 
you cant always get what you want 
if there is one thing that minorities have learned over the last eight years it is that they get what they want and whites perhaps as a natural corollary do not hence the indignation following this surprise victory 
problem has been favouring certain ethnic groups beyond reasonability people are people for example employment should go to the best qualified candidate regardless of race or ethnic creed an assumption is made on the governments part that an employer will unfairly select anglo saxon over other races which is wrong therefore the employer must use race based quota agendas to effect equality

obbop,no title,"the article explains a lot of the background to the white helmets and asks some important questions about the relations between government and ngos or as the author terms them neargovernment organisations the author should also be commended for the extensive bibliography
the author suggests that the truth about the white helmets may lie somewhere in the middle that the white helmets is a dualpurpose organisation with both humanitarian and propaganda functions
the author offers no evaluation of the video evidence provided by the white helmets which to a number of people seems incontrovertably fake and staged if this video evidence is indeed faked then it invites the question why is this necessary where are all the real casualties hasnt the russian bombing killed any civilians at all
the scd or white helmets counts nearly  rescue workers this claim comes only from the white helmets it could well be that the foreign office is paying for  salaries but whether those drawing
them are occupied in fulltime humanitarian work is another matter
after watching carefully the dubious video footage of rescue scenes and the far more convincing footage of white helmets participating in torture and abuse of prisoners it is difficult to see how the white
helmets are anything more than a set of expensive props and uniforms provided to extremist groups in aleppo and idlib and donned for propaganda purposes or when other uniforms are in the wash
furthermore given that the white helmets are funded by the governments and organisations who are totally unmoved by the plight of civilians in the greater part of syria the idea that these bodies would pay for humanitarian duties on the part of the white helmets seems somewhat optimistic
if the white helmets are have a dualpurpose function it is not propagandisthumanitarian but propagandistterrorist

Rmuse,north carolina republicans sued for rigging the election for trump,"yemen this still shows abdulmalik alhouthi the leader of yemens houthi ansarullah movement delivering a televised speech file photo 
the leader of yemens houthi ansarullah movement says saudi arabia commits crimes across the globe with the us green light 
abdulmalik alhouthi said on wednesday that the al saud family has adopted a hypocritical approach in the muslim world the proof of which is takfiri violence gripping the region 
when washington gives the riyadh regime the green light sedition sparks in all countries with the saudi offensive being in line with such a trend he added 
the houthi leader also warned that saudi arabia is seeking to damage security in some arab countries such as egypt yemen syria and iraq through petrodollars and deceptive propaganda works 
instead of countering the enemies of islam including the us and israel the kingdom has been engaged in spreading takfiri ideology and arming terrorists houthi noted 
saudi has yemenis blood on its hands 
on october  in one of the deadliest attacks yemen saudi warplanes bombarded a funeral hall packed with mourners in sanaa killing over  people and injuring at least  others 
human rights watch a new yorkbased rights group said that the sanaa bombing constitutes an apparent war crime while amnesty international said the attack was a reminder of the need for the suspension of arms sales to saudi arabia people inspect the aftermath of a saudi airstrike in sanaa yemen october   photo by ap 
saudi arabia committed crimes by the sanaa attack but it tried to acquit itself of the assault houthi said adding that there was no clear sign suggesting an end to the saudi offensive 
he also stressed that yemenis cannot rely on the united nations as the world body has not adopted a position regarding the saudi attack in sanaa 
houthi further wished victory for the palestinian nation and the resistance front in lebanon and syria as well as the iraqi people in their antiterror operation in the city of mosul 
the riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on yemen on sunday hours after a threeday truce in the conflictridden country expired 
yemen has seen almost daily military attacks by saudi arabia since late march  with the un putting the toll from the aggression at more than

Henry Wolff,putin condemns europes handling of migrants and says the child rape in austria shows a dilution of national values,"posted on november   how hillary courts the black vote ethnomasochism reaches a new low 
the democratic presidential primary was one of unprecedented pandering for the nonwhite vote as the guardian summed up one of the debates hillary clinton and bernie sanders made a conspicuous play for latino and african american voters mrs clinton won the conspicuous play hands down and with it the nomination the failure of senator sanders to win the necessary quotient of nonwhite votes was repeatedly pointed out by the chattering class up until the time he dropped out 
in february one black commenter pointedly wrote that sen sanders has many miles to go to convince black voters that he can fight for our interests by may black commenter steven thrasher wrote a piece titled  bernie sanders isnt winning minority votes  and its his own fault  mr thrasher identified sen sanderss problem as failing to talk about racism at every turn 
this accusation may seem ludicrous since sen sanders surrendered his stage to black lives matter activists several times but in comparison to mrs clinton mr thrasher was right about sen sanders no mainstream candidate in the history of the united states has more thoroughly debased himself in the quest for the black vote than mrs clinton since this helped her win the democratic nomination she has continued the strategy in the few days remaining before november th lets take a look at hillary clintons most ethnomasochistic moments 
 in january of  mrs clinton was at something called the iowa brown and black forum with none other than jorge ramos  where she was asked can you tell us what the term white privilege means to you and can you give me an example from your life or career when you think you have benefitted from it this is how she began her answer 
where do i start i think it is hard when you are swimming in the ocean to know exactly what is happening around you so much as it is when youre standing on the shore perhaps watching     i was born white middleclass in the middle of america    
 early in the democratic nomination mrs clintons campaign released a memo aimed at stifling the rising momentum of bernie sanders 
whereas the electorates in iowa and new hampshire are largely ruralsuburban and predominantly white the march primary states better reflect the true diversity of the democratic party and the nation     it will be very difficult if not impossible for a democrat to win the nomination without strong levels of support among african american and hispanic voters we believe thats how it should be emphasis added 
 shortly before the south carolina primary at schomburg center for research in black culture in harlem mrs clinton explained how to break down barriers for african americans 
ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of usespecially those of us who havent experienced it ourselves white americans need to do a better job of listening when african americans talk about the seen and unseen barriers that you face every day 
we need to recognize our privilege and practice humility rather than assume that our experiences are everyones experiences all of us need to bring our skills to bearand especially young people coming up today who have a passion for social justice and are helping to create new ways to solve intractable problems 
 in april of  while on a back radio show mrs clinton was asked what she always carries in her bag she immediately answered hot sauce when one of the black hosts noted that she would be accused of pandering to black people for giving that answer she asked hopeully is it working 
 just a few weeks after a black lives matter supporter murdered five police officers  the democratic national convention that convened to nominate mrs clinton passed a resolution no doubt with her approval supporting black lives matter  
the dnc joins with americans across the country in affirming black lives matter and the say her name efforts to make visible the pain of our fellow and sister americans as they condemn extrajudicial killings of unarmed african american men women and children 
white politicians have tried to win elections through public displays of ethnomasochism for decades but this election has set a new low and if mrs clinton loses her pandering could live on in another form as the black lives matter activist tef poe explained  if mr trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go    aint no more rules weve been too nice as is",amren.com,Fake,english,16.093066489392562,11.326876277819148,114,19,4509,762,4.860892388451443,762.0,1.5911490867569946,1.6769792585533674,0.4048482187501628,0.4166179106016723,-0.2252403327091455,0.4379556930474545,0.0026246719160104,0.0,0.0013123359580052,0,0,0.0,0.0043055630223198,0.8643,0.119,0.105,0.776,Positive,Very Strong

the demolitions affected  palestinians in the region marking an increase from  the previous year 
the revelations came only two days after israeli military forces razed three palestinian homes in the beit hanina and silwan neighborhoods of east jerusalem alquds displacing at least  people including minors 
international bodies and rights groups argue that israels sustained demolitions of palestinian homes and structures in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem alquds are an attempt by the tel aviv regime to uproot palestinians from their native territories and confiscate more land for expansion of illegal settlements

grinnell college is promoting a guide to help students avoid cultural appropriation this halloween warning that some costumes could be considered deplorable and problematic 
the guide provides several examples of costumes that might fit the definition of cultural appropriation defining the term as the act of displaying peoples cultures in a disrespectful or condescending manner 
the guide called my identity not your costume goes on to list several examples of offensive halloween costumes featuring pictures of grinnell students holding photos of costumes that would be considered disrespectful towards their culture 
in one instance the guide shows a picture of a burly white man dressed in lingerie with a sash proclaiming call me caitlyn referring to caitlyn jenner the photo is held by a grinnell student wearing a national coming out day pin and includes a caption stating the misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture 
another example of culturally appropriated halloween costumes according to the guide is using other cultures as accessories to appear more hipinteresting without adequate understanding or permission one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a hindu deity being held by an indian student and the message that such costumes are deplorable and problematic 
it then warns students that if their costumes take defining characteristics of another culture without permission or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture then these costumes might be too offensive to wear 
the guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a halloween costume asking does your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke as well as why would i find your halloween costume to be offensive

in constructing this illusory edifice the splc labels me and fourteen others antimuslim extremists we are of course no more antimuslim than foes of the nazis were antigerman but note the word extremists thats the mainstream media and obama administrations term of choice for jihad terrorists in what way are we extremists has anyone on the splcs hit list and given the splcs track record of inciting violence against its targets that is exactly what it is ever blown anything or anyone up beheaded anyone boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people no all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and sharia oppression the splc is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin the nonmuslim bin ladens and awlakis until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so however the splcs libel is only that a libel 
its also passingly ironic that the splc list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as islamophobes but their temporizing and pandering didnt work they ended up on the index of prohibited thinkers anyway as will ultimately anyone who dares to note that islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings 
the report as a whole stands as an example of the lefts strange tendency to present true statements as if they were selfevidently false without bothering to explain why apparently the splc knows its supporters and is aware that it doesnt need to bother with troublesome things like you know facts 
the splcs hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as selfevidently false for example it says that ann corcoran of refugee resettlement watch accuses immigrantrun stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps this is a case that corcoran makes with evidence  evidence that the splc doesnt bother to try disproving it says that steven emerson of the investigative project on terrorism has claimed that the obama administration extensively collaborates with the muslim brotherhood that he actually has done so doesnt seem to bother them as andrew c mccarthy has noted  barack obama has spent his presidency cultivating islamists particularly from the international muslim brotherhood and its affiliates in the united states the splc also hits emerison for having asserted that europe is riddled with nogo zones regarding nogo zones here are some news articles from just the past few weeks 
germany police sick of citizens nogo zone fears 
the splc excoriates brigitte gabriel of act for america for saying that any practicing muslim who believes the word of the koran to be the word of allah  who goes to mosque and prays every friday who prays five times a day  this practicing muslim who believes in the teachings of the koran cannot be a loyal citizen of the united states yet it says nothing of course about the many teachings of the quran that contradict american constitutional principles the denial of the freedom of speech the death penalty for apostasy the devaluation of women and more how to reconcile these teachings with us citizenship the splc did not bother to explain 
the splc quotes david horowitz saying there are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists  and that includes people in the democratic party even those who are antiterrorist here again no refutation is offered  yet the lefts dalliance with palestinian jihad groups and overall antiamericanism make it impossible to dismiss horowitzs assertion 
frank gaffney of the center for security policy were told is gripped by paranoid fantasies about muslims destroying the west from within the splc doesnt bother to mention the explanatory memorandum on the general strategic goal for the brotherhood in north america  the captured muslim brotherhood internal document that explained that brotherhood members must understand that their work in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions 
in attacking pamela geller of the american freedom defense initiative the splc descended to outright fabrications notes geller  their claim that i insist that obama is the love child of malcolm x is patently untrue the splc also states that i have spoken to a neofascist group in germany when in fact i have never even been to germany it characterizes former fbi agent john guandolos claim that cia director john brennan was a convert to islam as an outlandish accusation when in fact a us asset assigned overseas with brennan in saudi arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that brennan was indeed the target of a saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion brennan has also stated publicly that he visited mecca which is impossible for a nonmuslim to do unless he is a special guest of the saudi king 
even more strangely the splc targets ayaan hirsi ali a woman who grew up as a muslim in somalia suffered genital mutilated at the hands of muslims is under death threats from muslims and lives in exile from her homeland because of muslims instead of trying to discredit her the splc should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against sharia oppression but the splc has other priorities 
of me the splc concedes that i am a real intellectual but complains that i am entirely selftaught in the study of islam an odd objection one cannot be both selftaught and a real intellectual in any case its false i am indeed mostly selftaught in the study of islam and make no secret of or apologies for it every days headlines proves me correct nonetheless the fact is that i did first read the quran and began studying islam in earnest while at the university of north carolina my claims says the splc are provably false but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true without any attempt to refute them 
it even says that i have referred to barack obama as the first muslim president this one epitomizes the dishonesty of the splc the quote comes from an article i wrote in  discussing how obama was not a muslim stating that his obvious affinity for islam and the muslim world could make him into our first muslim president the way bill clinton was called our first black president after eight years of obama id say i was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion 
the splc finally hits me for having even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict muslims in a positive light 
the facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the splc george soros funded a report on islamophobia on twitter and gave  to the center for american progress for a defamatory report on alleged islamophobes he also spent  for favorable coverage of the muslim migrant inundation bought favorable coverage of the iran deal  and bought islamophobia propaganda after the san bernardino jihad massacre 
but what need does the splc have of facts it knows its readers wont check up on the veracity of its claims but will accept them at face value since the splc is of the camp of the saints the enlightened and tolerant left those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the splc feels bound to respect",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,82.22642928926737,34,7,8856,1505,4.863787375415282,1505.0,-0.854854060689619,-0.5778293249656962,1.5549412661462645,1.581404737619075,-0.2223832644890951,1.6299747791663977,0.001328903654485,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0026491980481014,-0.8709,0.102,0.104,0.795,Negative,Very Strong
Michael Snyder,if hillary clinton is charged with obstruction of justice she could go to prison for  years,"claire bernish 
censorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising hillary clinton  and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted 
facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown 
and facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case 
recent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of phan th? kim phúc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang 
that photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image 
ultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader rosa parks arrest 
but taking down of the image of kim phúc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  
trainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters 
in the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division justin osofsky admitted it had been a mistake 
according to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives 
in addition to osofsky global policy chief monika bickert government relations chief joel kaplan vice president for public policy and communications elliot schrage and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals 
all five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others 
company spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand 
for those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors 
indeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification 
although three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error 
in fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences 
earlier this year an exposé by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots 
however considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative 
in a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part 
and i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids 
after a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives 
senior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  
in the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards 
while the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility  and grave importance  of free speech",dcclothesline.com,Fake,english,15.763775383339585,5.169608718030007,91,16,6647,1047,5.299904489016237,523.5,0.8879231818660931,1.1132771126736014,0.9705024481803136,0.8634069357698552,0.2080215563454182,0.0553223794009296,0.0009551098376313,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0023657751784136,-0.9913,0.071,0.106,0.823,Negative,Very Strong
Fed Up,breaking nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least  timesmoney laundering underage sex payforplayproof of inappropriate handling classified information  percentfedupcom,"breaking nypd ready to make arrests in weiner casehillary visited pedophile island at least  timesmoney laundering underage sex payforplayproof of inappropriate handling classified information blackwater usa founder retired navy seal erik prince 
prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why fbi director james comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into clintons email server last week 
because of weinergate and the sexting scandal the nypd started investigating it through a subpoena through a warrant they searched his laptop and sure enough found those  emails they found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing prince claimed 
they found state department emails they found a lot of other really damning criminal information including money laundering including the fact that hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile jeffrey epstein bill clinton went there more than  times hillary clinton went there at least six times he said 
the amount of garbage that they found in these emails of criminal activity by hillary by her immediate circle and even by other democratic members of congress was so disgusting they gave it to the fbi and they said were going to go public with this if you dont reopen the investigation and you dont do the right thing with timely indictments prince explained 
i believe  i know and this is from a very wellplaced source of mine at pp one police plaza in new york  the nypd wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation and theyve gotten huge pushback to the point of coercion from the justice department with the justice department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of eric garner almost two years ago thats the level of pushback the obama justice department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters prince said 
theres five different parts of the fbi conducting investigations into these things with constant downdrafts from the obama justice department so in the i hope unlikely and very unfortunate event that hillary clinton is elected president we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since i believe  prince declared 
marlow asked prince to clarify these revelations 
nypd was the first one to look at that laptop prince elaborated weiner and huma abedin his wife  the closest adviser of hillary clinton for  years  have both flipped they are cooperating with the government they both have  they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes for huma abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the state department server and from hillary clintons own homebrew server which contained classified information weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found 
so nypd first gets that computer they see how disgusting it is they keep a copy of everything and they pass a copy on to the fbi which finally pushes the fbi off their chairs making comey reopen that investigation which was indicated in the letter last week the point being nypd has all the information and they will pursue justice within their rights if the fbi doesnt prince contended 
there is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails theyve seen of that  including money laundering underage sex payforplay and of course plenty of proof of inappropriate handling sendingreceiving of classified information up to sap level special access programs he stated 
so the plot thickens nypd was pushing because as an article quoted one of the chiefs  thats the level just below commissioner  he said as a parent as a father with daughters he could not let that level of evil continue prince said 
he noted that the fbi can investigate these matters but they cant convene a grand jury they cant file charges 
the prosecutors the justice department has to do that he explained now as i understand it preet bharara the manhattan prosecutor has gotten ahold of some of this from what i hear hes a standup guy and hopefully he does the right thing 
marlow agreed that bhararas sterling reputation as a determined prosecutor was bad news for the clintons 
prince agreed but said if people are willing to bend or break the law and dont really care about the constitution or due process  if youre willing to use stalinist tactics against someone  who knows what level of pressure could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials 
listen to interview here 
the point being fortunately its not just the fbi there are five different offices that are in the hunt for justice but the nypd has it as well prince said citing the wall street journal reporting that has exposed downdraft back pressure from the justice department against both the fbi and nypd in an effort to keep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on and is slowly being exposed 
the justice department is trying to run out the clock to elect hillary clinton to prevent any real justice from being done he warned 
as for the mayor of new york city prince said he has heard that de blasio wants to stay away from this 
the evidence is so bad the email content is so bad that i think even he wants to stay away from it which is really telling he said

in an age where information can be spread to millions of people within seconds its often difficult to separate fact from fiction that was certainly the case a few months ago when a controversial photo of president obama began to circulate online with many insisting that the image was the real unedited deal but today that picture was officially debunked the photo of obama with a speech balloon saying islam is my main thing has been proven to be doctored 
wow this is a good reminder to take everything you see on the internet with a grain of salt 
take a look at the photo in question above in it you can clearly see obama proudly declaring his unshakeable islamic faith 
at first glance the photo looks like pretty clear evidence that obama may be muslim and confirms the suspicions of his most farright critics who insist the president has been dishonest with the public about his true religious beliefs but when the image went viral on twitter one user pointed out a possible sign of doctoring 
many users agreed that the photo appeared to have been manipulated in some way and asked for an expert to weigh in a graphic designer named brendan mccann whose twitter bio says hes been in the industry for over a decade quickly answered the call 
but it was snopes that officially put the matter to rest after scouring the internet far and wide they were able to dig up the original version of the photograph taken during one of the presidents official white house photo ops and theres no speech balloon upholding the teachings of the quran anywhere in sight 
take a look at the two images side by side to see how the effect was achieved 
well there you have it it looks like whoever made this image took some of the space from above the presidents head and used it to overlay the speech balloon on top its a powerful effect but its definitely not real remember when it comes to the internet always question your sources",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,118,22,1929,347,4.538904899135447,347.0,1.7134492441293252,2.240681404433133,-0.2777466886070817,-0.2339696172748042,-0.5430104071410582,-0.2278423160230185,0.0028818443804034,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0043518053331226,0.9904,0.152,0.053,0.794,Positive,Very Strong

bill and hillary clinton just cant stay out of the spotlight these days and the most recent leak about them could be the most damaging yet as it turns out someone once close to the duo just came forward to share bills revealing nickname for his wife  but the worse comes as their dirty bedroom habits were exposed 
its no mystery that bill clinton is a sexual deviant but the most recent account given by the woman who had a decade affair with the man is damning to say the least according to an exclusive interview given to mail online dolly kyle was behind the scenes long enough to not only know the twos darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits  and now shes telling everyone 
the connection between dolly and bill began when she was just yearsold he was about yearsold at the time but dolly states that there was an immediate attraction even then as the years progressed the two became romantically involved and stayed that way through several of their marriages over the next  years 
the real affair began in  just after dolly divorced her first husband and although bill wasnt married yet he would be within the year although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship she states that she snapped when she heard hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the right to be believed 
knowing full well just what hillary had done  between the threats and the lies  to the many women who either had an affair with or were sexually assaulted by her husband bill dolly knew she had to do something about it unfortunately for hillary dolly is now coming forward with the dirty word nickname bill husband once called hillary among other things 
according to mail online bill approached dolly at their high schools year reunion to talk about  the warden  aka hillary saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage this was the least significant account dolly had to share 
in fact dolly recalls that bill mentioned something about having a baby to her although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her he was actually talking about hillary he wanted to put to bed the rumors that hillary was a lesbian even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true 
dolly states that the worst came when she met hillary for the first time in that moment i noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering body odor of perspiration and greasy hair i hoped that i wouldnt gag when she got in my car she said the sandalshod woman with lank smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone

Roosh Valizadeh,election result discussion for the  presidential election open thread,"earlier i skewered nine dictators thugs demagogues and politicians adored by leftists despite considerable failings in policy ethics and hygiene here are six more overhyped figures revered by leftists who always get everything wrong
franklin delano roosevelt 
how the world remembers fdr led america through the great depression and wwii remembered fondly by seniors who heard his inspiring fireside chats
the ugly truth some economists argue that fdrs measures prolonged the great depression  all the new deal programs were struck down as unconstitutional except social security he got the supreme court to back off by threatening to pack the court with more members with views to his liking that restrained their judicial opinion though the constitution doesnt grant congress the power to create a federal retirement system
social security worksthough its slim pickings if its a retirees only incomeand for decades the surplus has been a cash cow offsetting congressional overspending  however the aging baby boomers who didnt have enough children might turn the cash cow into an albatross further the social security number is now a defacto universal id number a convenient database field for monitoring citizens  americas founding fathers would have been appalled at todays domestic spying  and the soviet dictators of old would have wept with envy
fdr pledged to keep the usa out of wwii  meanwhile he quietly did everything possible to antagonize japan a oncefriendly nation such as among several items freezing their assets and cutting off their oil supply when he got intelligence of the upcoming attack on pearl harbor he didnt order the base to be locked and loaded
if that wasnt bad enough so nearly a quarter million americans died in battle but at least the pivotal intervention came just in time to make the world safe for democracy right unfortunately fdr was far too friendly with the ussr giving them nearly  billion in food weaponry and other supplies about  billion adjusted for inflation
at the yalta conference fdr agreed to let uncle joe stalin take over eastern europe general patton wanted to press forward at full speed to keep as much territory as possible away from soviet tyranny but politics hampered him every step of the way until he got rubbed out  when the iron curtain rose and the cold war began winston churchill said we slaughtered the wrong pig if only roosevelt had listened to his generals
fdr wasnt a communist but many of his appointees and trusted advisers were later joseph mccarthy barely scratched the surface trying to get rid of them
walter cronkite 
how the world remembers he was a longtime cbs anchorman reporting many triumphs and tragedies a friendly face on living room tvs for decades he became everyones uncle walter according to polls he was the most trusted man in america
the ugly truth although a decent fellow in person cronkite was the archetypal bigname liberal journalist  spinning the news for decades sometimes it was rather subliminal including his signature subtle sneer most of the public then believed journalists were muckrakers and unbiased truthtellers as cronkites tagline went and thats the way it is
until cronkites late career the mainstream media had a veneer of respectabilityperhaps like warped plastic barely sticking to crumbling particleboard but a veneer nonetheless there once were only three american corporate tv networks from manhattan they were the publics information gatekeepers no other broadcast news besides shortwave radio was available baby boomer liberals might get a bit mistyeyed remembering those days today six megaconglomerates own  of the media but at least the internet lets us present our own perspectives and call out biased reporters 
if that wasnt bad enough  his biggest whopper was about the tet offensive the viet cong launched a desperate allout assault suffered very heavy losses mostly it was over within a day and ultimately the vc gained no territory however the most trusted man in america gave them a propaganda victory reporting that the vietnam war was hopeless public opinion promptly turned against the war ho chi minh shouldve given cronkite a medal an honorary vc generalship and a dozen roses
many forget that the  paris accords brought peace two years later though the shaky ford administration couldnt persuade congress to respond appropriately to a shit test by north vietnam then they invaded and saigon fell all thats a long story but public opinion from biased reporting certainly didnt help that affected americas prestige abroad along with the lives of millions of south vietnamese killed or sent to reeducation camps 
allen ginsberg 
how the world remembers he was a pioneer of the beatniks much beloved by the hippies who followed and lauded with several literary prizes some even credit him with basically starting the s counterculture singlehandedly
the ugly truth ginsberg was neurotic and a degenerate he wrote a socalled poem about his sphincter yes really but the rest isnt much better anyone considering his bathroom wall ravings as profound either is educated beyond his ability to comprehend believed the hype and didnt read it or dropped too much acid
howl his bestknown poem begins i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness a brief excerpt get some brain bleach describing these best minds
who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of capitalism
who distributed supercommunist pamphlets in union square weeping and undressing while the sirens of los alamos wailed them down and wailed down wall and the staten island ferry also wailed
who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons
who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication
who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts
who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists and screamed with joy
who blew and were blown by those human seraphim the sailors caresses of atlantic and caribbean love
who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may 
even overlooking the lunacy buggery and butthurt ginsbergs free verse is stylistically lazy back when poetry meant keats and kipling it rhymed and had meter
he was a noted critic of the usa for example
america i used to be a communist when i was a kid im not sorry
ginsberg visited several communist countries getting himself deported from some of them for immorality he abandoned his ancestral faith for buddhism and had a hare krishna phase what people believe is up to them of course but adding these two things upalong with his wretched poetryreveals a tortured soul rejecting everything one belongs to is childish rebellion for rebellions sake
granted ginsbergs popularity was greatest during the screwedup kill your parents s still what were those who promoted his crapulous drivel smoking were the literary gatekeepers pushing cultural marxism running out of talented writers
if that wasnt bad enough ginsberg joined the north american manboy love association sometimes speaking kindly on their behalf explaining in an accurately titled interviewpolitics pederasty and consciousnessto the harvard crimson 
as i get older having very specialised sexual tastes it gets harder to make out i like young boys why id have more chance at making out with younger guys if i were younger dewier dewylimbed
the media usually portrays pickup artists as reprobates and screeched about donald trumps yearsold private locker room talk but the presstitutes likewise the lefty intelligentsia fawningly praised ginsberg despite his appetite for young boys 
ted kennedy best friends forever east and west
how the world remembers he was the lion of the senate representing massachusetts from  until his death in  this champion of social justice carried on the kennedy legacyhailed as americas nobilityafter his two brothers were tragically slain
the ugly truth he was as passionate for booze and adultery as he was for social justice but the suckers kept reelecting him his lack of character sank way deeper though all the way underwater
after a night of partying on chappaquiddick island ted kennedy drove off a bridge he escaped but failed to help his passenger mary jo kopechne per one of the investigators she suffocated slowly in an air pocket for about two hours if hed ran to a nearby house for helprather than waiting nine hours to sober upshe wouldve survived he got a two month suspended sentence barely a slap on the wrist for vehicular manslaughter the judge basically said poor teddy had suffered enough what about how miss kopechne suffered theres one set of rules for the elites  and another for us shortly thereafter he tried to spindoctor it with a woe is me shtick the suckers kept reelecting him though a presidential bid was now beyond reach
as for his many legislative actions the immigration and nationality act of  was the most notorious he promised the public 
first our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually under the proposed bill the present level of immigration remains substantially the same secondly the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset contrary to the charges in some quarters the bill will not inundate america with immigrants from any one country or area or the most populated and deprived nations of africa and asia in the final analysis the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think the bill will not flood our cities with immigrants it will not upset the ethnic mix of our society it will not relax the standards of admission it will not cause american workers to lose their jobs 
the lion of the senate was lyin his fat ass off this population replacement policy threatens americas future  just as the coudenhovekalergi plan is doing in europe still the suckers kept reelecting him
if that wasnt bad enough besides giving away the country to which the constitution granted the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  lyin ted was in cahoots with the kgb  he proposed to help his soviet pal yuri andropov with tidying up the ussrs image problem during the cold wars endgame the damning documents suggested that walter cronkite see above and barbara walters might be used for this effort conservatives often suspect liberals are soft on communism little did they know how cozy ted kennedy was in bed with comrade andropov
john lennon 
how the world remembers he was a talented musician arguably the most prominent of the beatles their story was an archetypal garage band becoming a bar band and eventually breaking out into great fame lennon produced dozens of hits that still get air play hes remembered as a wonderful man an embodiment of the s the good parts  anyway and the conscience of the world
the ugly truth despite lennons considerable talents not all his songs were excellent things slipped with the white album  revolution  really after the beatles broke up he started a solo career often featuring songs with sophomoric political poses his last album produced during his lifeafter dragging himself out of a long heroin stuporwas double fantasy  critics at first agreed that it sucked after a nut shot lennon they felt sorry for him and declared it brilliant
lennon was the archetypal leftist celebrity using fame to push politics granted everyone has a right to their opinion but being able to sing or act confers no special political expertise his song imagine is particularly telling as he put it
imagine that there was no more religion no more country no more politics is virtually the communist manifesto even though im not particularly a communist and i do not belong to any movement
being under the shadow of the berlin wall back in their bar gig days shouldve precluded sophomoric posturing like this
if that wasnt bad enough his failings are quite troubling too numerous to fully detail one item is abandoning his family the way his own father did a truly wonderful man wouldnt do that
another item was his extensive substance abuse he spent  guzzling booze his lost weekend one night a waitress refused service because he stuck a menstrual pad on his head then
lennon do you know who i am
waitress yeah youre some asshole with a kotex on his forehead
one lennon biographer asked timothy leary whod been on hundreds of acid trips what lennons extreme lsd consumption would do leary had no idea finally what kind of inner vacuum caused this highly successful musician much beloved by the public to get himself strung out on heroin
jimmy carter in this heartwarming scene jimmy carter and uncle fidel stand for the cuban national anthem in havana
how the world remembers carter is praised as a rare honest politician exemplifying christian principles and tolerance
the ugly truth the economy tanked during the carter administration doubledigit inflation and high unemployment economists are still puzzled by stagflation normally unemployment and inflation are inversely correlated at least obama gave economists another data point to study
carters commendably not corrupt but exemplified bleedinghearted liberalism despite winning the nobel peace prize for not being george w bush likewise al gore and the lightworker carter was a lackluster embarrassment he was known for tmi statements for example about his hemorrhoids and committing adultery in his heart at least clinton had the balls to do it for real he ranked lower than mr whipple on a face recognition survey the boston globe reported on one of his speeches with the headline more mush from the wimp finally journalists got something right
carters shining foreign policy moment was the camp david accords establishing peace between egypt and israel america started giving over a billion annually to each party for making peace which ironically supplies their military why the usa wasnt even a combatant aside from the uss liberty incident which certainly shouldnt inspire american tribute money taxpayers still fund this absurd protection racket
worse he badly bungled the iran hostage crisis one iranian official later stated they wouldve released the hostages if the usa had threatened force in the beginning yep carter failed irans shit test consequentially the usa lost tons of international prestige and the ordeal of the hostages dragged on unnecessarily
if that wasnt bad enough carter is often a little too cordial with notorious dictators  worse clinton trusted him to represent the usa during disarmament talks with north korea they gave him the potemkin village show he bought it hook line and sinker yet again carter was played for a chumpthe usa opened its wallet and gave north korea aid and they pinkyswore to stop their nuclear program now the norks have nukessurprise awesome job mister nice guy

Henry Wolff,some cities want their noncitizen immigrants to vote,"go back to where you claim home kansas lawmaker tells protester dion lefler wichita eagle october   
kansas state rep joe seiwert commented on facebook that an africanamerican singer who knelt while performing the star spangled banner at a miami heat game should go back to where she claims as home 
seiwert rpretty prairie posted that comment and a longer followup on an antiblack meme that was originally posted to a prodonald trump facebook group and then shared by one of seiwerts constituents 
seiwert confirmed the comments were his and said he was exercising his first amendment right to free speech as he says the woman in the meme did when she wore a black lives matter tshirt and knelt while singing the anthem 
snip 
the photo in the meme is of denasia lawrence a miami social worker and according to the miami sunsentinel a parttime gamenight employee of the heat professional basketball team the team has issued a statement saying team officials were unaware that lawrence planned to protest when they asked her to sing the anthem at fridays preseason game with the philadelphia ers 
snip 
to which seiwert responded i am where i claim home and like it they want to claim it and it is their right to go where ever they like so if they dont like it here i believe that their freedom completely allows them to go wherever they believe is more free and non racist if thats what they believe 
seiwert said he didnt see the profanity in the meme when he commented and didnt do anything wrong 
i have a personal life besides a legislative life he said maybe it was inappropriate i dont believe so because i said nothing derogatory and i believe that if people are that upset with the national anthem they can do whatever they want to on their own time but when theyre using it on national tv to make a statement thats not right 
i said if she lawrence doesnt like it here then go where she would like it whats wrong with that he said 
asked why a person should leave rather than try to change things where they are seiwert responded because maybe theres other people who dont want their place changed 
he also said he did not think his comments had anything to do with race 
it dont make any difference if theyre black white or green its the disrespect to our country he said and why does everybody put the color to it 
snip 
the person who made the meme took a photo of lawrence from the web and added in capital letters kneeling while singing the national anthem    im so sick of these antiamerican blacks    expletive black lives matter

Shawn Helton,fbi redux whats behind new probe into hillary clinton emails,"a tidal wave of revelations is pouring out of the clinton campaign as the  presidential election draws to a close 
meltdown the clinton campaign continues to unravel following a series of troubling details photo illustration wire 
over the weekend it was discovered through a wikileaks email dump that neera tanden of the center for american progress  john podesta s top aide had an email exchange with michael lux of progressive strategies revealing that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners was closely allied with clinton campaign manager robby mook  
political bombshell clinton campaign manager robby mook had close ties to disgraced dnc consultant robert creamer image source lockerdome  
creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative nonprofit project veritas  not only was it revealed that the creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at donald trump rallies on camera  he also met with white house officials some  times over the past year including  private meetings with president obama or other senior officials 
dnc scandal robert creamer of democracy partners and democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky image source national vanguard  
creamers visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky  
white house visitor records have shown that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  potentially giving the clinton campaign and the dnc plausible deniability 
the mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim dnc chair donna brazile  is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two  town hall debates brazile stepped down from her role at cnn earlier in october heres a passage from the daily caller describing the scenario 
donna brazile the interim chair of the democratic national committee began providing town hall and debate questions to the clinton campaign earlier than previously known emails released by wikileaks on monday show 
the article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim dnc chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined 
in the march  exchange brazile mentions roland martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign 
ill send a few more though some questions roland submitted brazile wrote to palmieri in the march  email thread which is entitled from time to time i get the questions in advance 
martin is a commentator for tv one and the host of news one now  as well as a cnn contributor 
in another matter the wall street journal revealed the following  while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the fbi and doj while the fbi appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments 
the latest development began in early october when new yorkbased fbi officials notified andrew mccabe of the terry mcauliffe campaign contribution scandal the bureaus secondincommand that while investigating mr weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor they had recovered a laptop many of the  emails on the computer they said were from the accounts of ms abedin according to people familiar with the matter 
some critics have called for mccabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received  from a wellknown clinton confidant terry mcauliffe  this was further underlined after the house oversight commitee wanted more information about the senate campaign of dr jill mccabe and its ties to the clintons 
the alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates objected to fbi director james comey reopening the clinton email server case this past week  something that added to the lynchclinton tarmac meeting before the first fbi ruling in the clinton case 
according to a report filed by zero hedge  a close friend of podesta peter kadzik  the assistant attorney general of the department of justice doj will be in charge of a probe into huma abedin  clintions closest aide 
interestingly as a mountain of controversy envelops the clinton campaign the fbi is now conducting an early inquiry into former trump campaign manager paul manafort  over his alleged foreign business connections 
back in august the following business connection was revealed by nbc news  
in  according to court records senior trump aide paul manaforts firm was involved with a ukrainian oligarch named dmytro firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous new york hotel the drake the total value of the project was  million firtashs company planned to invest over  million the records say 
that same year firtash acknowledged to the us ambassador in ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious russian crime lord according to a classified state department cable other cables say firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between russia and the ukraine 
although the us state department has determined that firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in russia  so far theres nothing directly linking manafort to any underground element at this time 
watch this space  as the russiatrump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the clinton campaign meltdown

creamer who allegedly spearheaded the dirty tricks for the democrats wasnt just consulting for the democratic national committee according to videos made by project veritas he was sending people to provoke trump at events

this account syndicates news from other media outlets november   news 
via breitbart  
republican presidential candidate donald trump was rushed offstage at a reno nevada campaign rally as a protester in the audience was involved in an extended incident near the stage 
it was not immediately clear what was occurring in the crowd but several members of what appeared to be law enforcement or us secret service jumped down into the area where the protester was as could be seen on right side broadcasting networks video livestream of the event 
video of trump being rushed off stage was posted online 
in the video it appears trump pauses to look out into the crowd for the event disrupter two us secret service agents can be seen rushing in to remove trump from the stage and two other agents also facilitate his removal 
during his absence someone announced to the crowd that trump would return the protester was eventually seen being removed from the crowd although there appeared to be a struggle with several law enforcement or secret service agents to secure the protesters removal it was several minutes before trump was able to take the stage again 
as trump returned to the stage he thanked the crowd which cheered him back

we have the biggest territory in the world like i said everyone knows it and we need to provide effectively security for our own country for our own people he added 
he noted that russias armed forces are perfectly capable of providing security and that developing the forces will continue he also hailed efforts made so far to make the military efficient modern and highly effective 
the number of military drills has increased multiple times including snap checks which for some reasons from time to time worry our counterparts lets call them as such for now he added 
he added that other countries drills do not worry russia the russian army must be compact but highly effective thus we shall continue the structural reform and we shall keep optimizing the personnel but without any mass cuts russian female cadets take part in the military parade at red square in moscow on november

dr slattery joined the show and recounted how jews created a culture of self criticism in the s among whites and then used the resulting environment to push through an immigration act that fundamentally transformed the demographics of the country to the extent that it took a miracle for whites simply to elect the president of their choice

No Author,fear of trump bush obama clinton all buying property in nonextradition nations,"email 

an email published by wikileaks on friday reveals the extent to which democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends 
the  email appears shows democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results 
fyi we are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll sample too small otherwise operative tom matzzie wrote to clinton adviser paul begala campaign chairman john podesta media matters for america founder david brock and operative susan mccue good begala responded 
trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant hillary lead over trump have been manipulated through selective sampling there is ample evidence that this occurs in democratfriendly newsrooms 
hillary clinton has opened up a point lead over donald trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a bounce for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the democratic nomination last week the daily mail reported in june 
but the weekly tracking poll from nbc news and the surveymonkey company included the opinions of  percent more selfidentified democrats than republicans  the same margin as the polls topline result the article noted 
the email released by wikileaks friday proves that democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics 
polls are a powerful propaganda tool and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidates loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on election day

dr duke and pastor dankof on trumps america first foreign policy 
today dr duke had pastor mark dankof as his guest for the hour they talked about donald trumps appointments to his new cabinet they gave low marks to representative mike pompeo as the new cia director for his past policy positions although they noted his loyalty to trump as a potential silver lining they also panned nikki hailey as the un ambassador which however does allow trump supporter henry mcmaster succeed her as south carolina governor 
the most hopeful prospect is congresswoman tulsi gabbard from hawaii who is a potential secretary of state she has supported trumps desire to reconcile with russia and has been the most vocal opponent in congress of the obama administrations efforts to overthrow syrian president assad her appointment would go a long way towards wresting control of american foreign policy from jewish neocons and putting americas interests first again

the giant flaming garbage dump that is clintonworld is offering up a wonderful new development sure to excite anyone who wanted to combine the weiner scandal and the hillary email scandal 
yes virginia you can now have both of them in one like peanut butter and jelly or shampoo and conditioner in one theyve been merged into one horrible stinking landfill for your entertainment and the downfall of the republic 
the fbi has reopened its investigation into hillary clintons use of a private server while secretary of state after discovering new emails  apparently during the probe of former rep anthony weiners sexting  in a stunning turn of events just days before the presidential election 
fbi director james comey wrote in a letter to top members of congress friday that the bureau has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation 
comey did not detail those emails saying only that they surfaced in connection with an unrelated case 
an fbi source though confirmed to fox news that the new emails were discovered after the bureau seized devices belonging to disgraced rep weiner and his wife huma abedin a top clinton aide who recently announced she was separating from the former congressman the new york times first reported on the weiner investigation connection noting the fbi had been probing texts weiner sent to a yearold girl 
as donald trump and congressional republicans seized on the fbis decision interim democratic party leader donna brazile simply tweeted good grief after the news of the anthony weiner connection broke

andré is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   politics 
the  th of november  was a great day we will remember it as well as our parents remember the first moon landing in july  or the fall of the berlin wall liberal mainstream mediaalmost a pleonasmare either stunned or agitating some of these crybullies clamour to themselves how fearful they are lament on the destruction of the westa curious expression as it seldom appears under leftist pensor have difficulties to acknowledge that the man they have despised and defamed every day for months will be the  th president of the united states 
outside the us the donalds victory is creating waves too so many liberals allegedly connected to the canadian immigration website to crash it in france the bourgeois bohemians who work in the media academia and everything that constitutes the big left establishment do the same posturing than their american counterparts whereas the petits blancs impoverished disenfranchised whites and local righters rejoice 
in brazil where your humble servant lives the official media is making some tedious comments that deliver a flabby criticism local leftist talking heads condemn the  white protestants  and reality shows in a very cliché posturing that mixes antiwhite prejudice with a critique of capitalism whereas some new traditionalists among whom some have been avid readers and makers of altright content are grateful  
this is our victory feels good man 
a propepe facebook group has had a substantive discussion about where a redpilled foreigner considering moving to the us after the donald won should go to make a long story short some have advised potential newcomers to go live in the midwest in texas as long as one stays away from houston or dallas in wyoming for the gun rights in pennsylvania excluding philadelphia and the urban areas close to the appalachian mountains if one enjoys outdoors while staying away from illinois most of those who participated were whites but i have spotted some latino and arab names some made jokes on these names but no fuss 
and here the following question arises what defines us liberals have been shrieking about xenophobia or racism all the time yet strictly national boundaries are much less relevant than before even for us  even when we all rejoiced about trumps promise to make a wall all over the world we are rejoicing around the gop candidates victory 
american trumpists undoubtedly feel closer to nonamericans who have been dissenting from the nwo on the internet and wanted the donald to pass than to american libtards a lot of us are ok with having nonwhites around we dont pander to arrogant aggressive antiwhites but that does not mean we would have to be racists as the liberal caricature wants us to be to cut in more personally i know of no genuine redpilled or altrighter who would have rejected me as a frog although i remember some stars and stripes cucks blaming me for daring to speak about american politics without owning a us passport the frog is green after all 
so once again what defines us why are we a we race plays a role for sure we struggle to keep the white people from getting dissolved into the acid bath of widescale miscegenation and dispossession we want a right to solidarity based at least partly on race ie on lineage and identity just like all the pseudominority groups out there we fight the double standard that allows them to be communitarian tribalistic nepotistic without being ever responsible of what they do whereas we are supposed to keep our heads down and be taught everything by liberal social engineers in a world where we would have no freedom no future no dignity 
but even then there have been blacks latinos  and many women who participated into bringing the donald to the white house i have a racemixed friend who supported trump all along this is not to say im not a racist afraid cuckservativestyle but to show there are some and we know it firsthand 
it is no mystery why most of us are white we are united around a civilization that was primarily built by people of european descent but there is more too 
and this more that i think defines and binds us this more is shared awareness  on the periphery of the system centers we managed to grow and gather 
we are all aware broadly speaking of the same phenomena and trends we have witnessed the breakup of families and harmonious relationships between men and women we have been faced with the untold prohibition to make the least critic of feminism minority groups aggressive identitarianism and with the pervasive omnipresence of these leftist norms commonly referred to as political correctness we have seen neoliberalism allowing a handful of careless irresponsible assholes sending the jobs overseas importing thirdworld immigration then force us into a life of chronic unemployment or endless struggles against other lowwage individuals for a small place under the sun 
we saw how conservatism was a sham that never faced the genuine problems we witnessed societies crumble conflictual minoritarian group identities being crafted by the likes of soros and the meritorious worker or professionalwhatever his racegetting exploited to the benefit of the lower and upper parasites we saw the liberal establishment using various social categories like pawns to create horizontal struggles and depopulation  
of course some disagreements can be found on this or that particular issue but we all see the same devastated landscape in lieu of the brilliant civilization the west once was 
and here is the major fault line the leftists deny or value they often go from the former to the latterthe replacement of native european population the aggressive and tribalistic stance of minority groups towards the silent majority the forced inclusion of individuals into sick identity politics games the perpetual hostility and institutionalized prejudice against whites and males either the leftists utterly deny what we are aware of for example when they say that whites are not under replacement or they demonize it as a remnant of some privilege or prejudice 
all their talk about oppressed minorities dissimulates the very real disenfranchisement of the white majority of nonwhite meritorious and integrated westerners and serves to deny us from our rights to public empathy to dignity or to even basically survive in a world of our own they work on language and representations because their job consists in manipulating these thus brainwashing us into seeing the world through their lenses and denying the legitimacy of any other vision 
the importance of shared awareness explains why we united on the internet a lot of us were closet nationalists years ago and still are we could not and often still cannot be nationalists in public or we would have been excluded from normal social life by the local leftists and cowards leftist hegemony was and is still real in the mainstream you know hegemony when you see it and spend countless hours thinking about how you can thrive even when living under it 
in the mid i found out about the information website fdesouche native french quote by the standards of today this news aggregator seems hardly interesting it mostly collates pieces written by others but then it was fantastic here i could recognize what i already felt about the worldthat something was wrong with all these nonwhites thugs holding the streets and getting lavish promotion when they bragged about it it was all concentrated before my eyes and others were talking about what they went through daily as well at least others felt and saw the same as i did i was not crazy not bound to a life of unauthenticity or forlorn solitude among the almighty left we were assembling and we were on the internet fdesouchecomthe website they want to keep you from visiting 
as most of us found ourselves under attack from nonnative frenchmen and knowing intuitively that identity goes deeper than the fleeting winds today called culture we often despised immigration in general but eventually things changed thanks to alain soral  mostly who emphasized how racial struggle was leading to sterile battles among disenfranchised people while letting the truly powerful off the hook mathias cardet a black journalist who worked with soral showed how gangstarap culture was injected and nurtured among nonwhites by powerful interests 
after all one can be black or arab and wanting to live in peace as a free individual not as an identity politics pawn who spends his life attacking another social category 
being prowhite promasculinity and protradition does not require being white i often felt closer from muslims with good intentions ie muslims who were genuine believers and not rancorous people using islam as a mask for antiwhite tribalism than from white liberals the muslims would not share my blood but they would share some of my awareness and yearning for tradition two things that white liberals eagerly reject faith front warriors alliance against common foes 
the internet is immaterial it is basically a network where information flows awareness and the will to spread it are immaterial as well this is why we could meet and act on the internet after all the alt right and manosphere have been sharing ideas media contents memes advisesand only later proceeded to meetups panicking the totalitarian liberals in the process 
trumps victory is a major one regardless of what the donald will actually do it is an event of considerable historical magnitude but it is only the beginningmake no mistake about that the libtards establishment still holds loads of money of institutions of cultural territory it has started to crumble and leak  yet it is still there 
major battles are waiting ahead we have to further our awareness make thorough research on every aspect of leftism and develop more proper cultural references 
always remember the libtards never cared one second about us they would have let us die off alone poor childless traumatized and demonized had we not chosen to follow the path of the red pill 
america is a firsttier power but it is still a battlefield among others wherever we are it is time to thicken our mutual relationships and cooperate more closely it is a battle not between nationals and foreigners but between workers and parasites between those who feel the void and wrongness in the rotten core of postmodernity and those who dwell in the last liberal trend between the realists who want freedom and responsibility in a healthy world of values and cultures against those who ravel in blue pill media bullshit complacency parasitism and cucking for the empire of nothing

there is no question that reopening the fbi investigation into hillary clintons email server is a big deal the fbi normally avoids acting just before an election in order to avoid charges of political manipulation nbc reports 
the fbi is reviewing a new batch of hillary clinton emails bureau director james comey said in a letter to the senate judiciary committee on friday 
in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation  i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he wrote 
the very first thing to note is that comey made no mention of a grand jury the emails whose existence he learned of may have been the result of a subpoena in another investigation if that is the case further subpoenas are quite possible a tool that was left unused in the investigation to date 
there are  competing theories as to why he might be doing this now that come to mind he might be seeking to restore his badly damaged reputation recognizing that the damage he has inflicted on the fbi is substantial three days ago american thinker published an open letter from a retired fbi agent hugh galyean that laid out some of the damage comey has inflicted on the institution he leads there is little doubt that this reached many in the fbi family putting in print what people have only whispered about if those silenced voices start speaking out comey could face a serious loss of face in this scenario he is heading off a staff rebellion possibly including mass resignations rush limbaugh today discussed an alternative theory that by announcing an fbi investigation resuming comey is putting a lid on further attention to wikileaks i guess this means that clinton forces will argue we must wait for the investigation to be complete after the election before speaking about what the evil russians are planting into our politics it is possible that something so dramatic came up in the pertinent emails that postponing a public reaction by not announcing the reopening of the investigation would be regarded as political interference by covering up a smoking gun until after the election in this scenario comey is assuming the evidence cannot be suppressed and that he would be held accountable after it comes out this scenario also indicates that we could be headed for a constitutional crisis involving the possible indictment of a presidentelect before an election or the evidence being turned over to the house of representatives for impeachment hearings 
well know more in the coming days and i am sure there are other possible theories and motives it is shame that we have to speculate and that the oncerespected fbi director is now subject to analysis of his political gamesmanship newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,2.2264292892673696,18,4,3271,546,4.970695970695971,546.0,-1.3440546901789416,-1.141531470845462,0.0773084918864927,0.0779988599478917,-0.1168749655426868,0.0914198618204131,0.0054945054945054,0.0,0.0036630036630036,0,1,0.0,0.0110228786751417,-0.9874,0.037,0.105,0.858,Negative,Very Strong

Henry Wolff,white students start whitesonly group to wreck white racism,"harvard cancels mens soccer season after finding sexually explicit reports continued through  andrew m duehren et al harvard crimson november   
harvard has cancelled the mens soccer teams season after an office of general counsel review found that the team continued to produce vulgar and explicit documents rating women on their perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance 
athletics director robert l scalise wrote in an email to harvard student athletes that he decided to cancel the rest of the teams season because the practice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond  including in  
as a direct result of what harvard athletics has learned we have decided to cancel the remainder of the  mens soccer season scalise wrote the team will forfeit its remaining games and will decline any opportunity to achieve an ivy league championship or to participate in the ncaa tournament this year 
last week the crimson reported that the  mens soccer team created a scouting report of that years womens soccer recruits rating them numerically and assigning each a hypothetical sexual position university president drew g faust instructed ogc harvards team of lawyers to review the matter 
snip 
the decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential and reflects harvards view that both the teams behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable have no place at harvard and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community faust wrote in a statement 
faust wrote she was deeply distressed to learn that the appalling actions of the  mens soccer team were not isolated to one year or the actions of a few individuals 
snip 
last week when scalise first saw the documentswhich were until recently publicly accessible through the  teams google grouphe said he would immediately reach out to coaches of both mens and womens teams to discuss the report but added that any response should be internal to harvard and not a media thing

mens soccer coach pieter s lehrer wrote in a statement that the team is beyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way but we respect the decision made by our administration

Joe Kovacs,limbaugh democrats would destroy jesus christ,"print saeed toosi right and ayatollah khamenei 
after failed attempts by top iran officials to cover up the scandal the nations leading reciter of the quran and close friend of ayatollah khamenei has been accused of raping  of his students and charged with advocating corruption 
saeed toosi  winner of the first prize for reading the quran both internationally and locally fell under suspicion after a broadcast by persian voice of america  banned for viewing by tehran  in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by toosi reported al arabiya 
in an audio recording toosi said that khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and together with the head of irans judicial authority had agreed to a coverup to protect the reputation of the nations quranic institution and the regime 
its time to stop tiptoeing around the facts the politically incorrect guide to islam and the crusades is a muchneeded dose of truth about the religion of peace 
one document has toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a mistake one of the victims  a recent firstplace winner in a quranic competition  claimed he was raped when he was  while traveling abroad with toosi to attend a competition the mentor according to the charge booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place 
all victims who have filed statements were between  and  at the time of the alleged attacks the incidents took place over the past seven years during quranic trips to more than  countries in the world aimed at spreading the quranic culture and to participate in quranic competitions 
toosi is highly respected as irans most celebrated reader of the quran and was previously called an exemplary model to be followed by khamenei current supreme leader of iran he is a permanent guest of khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during ramadan last may toosi was asked to recite verses from the quran at the opening session of the shura council with many of irans top officials in attendance 
the students told persian voa they had filed charges with the house of leadership but officials dismissed their claims citing a repentance letter from toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a changed man 
while iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced the case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the islamic republic 
according to the reformist amad news officials held a twohour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast the initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in toosi now being charged 
judiciary chief ayatollah sadeq larijani whom the victims audio showed conspiring with khamenei to cover up the incidents defended the regimes handling of the case london guardian reported larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with hostile media in the voa story so we know who is loyal to the revolution and who is not 
the case has been given to a judge for a ruling though there will be no public trial awad news reports members of the army of the guardians of the islamic revolution are planning to assassinate toosi to end the scandal and save the regimes reputation

okay lets address this hillary might win the popular vote isnt that electoral college situation just awful thing head on 
no its not awful its great and it protects the importance of your vote its also uniquely american and demonstrates yet again the onceincreation brilliance of the founding fathers 
first of all shes probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast she may win the number of votes counted but not the votes cast 
states dont count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference if there is a margin of  votes counted and there are  absentee ballots outstanding then the state tabulates those if the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldnt influence the election results then the absentee ballots arent counted 
who votes by absentee ballot students overseas the military businesspeople on trips etc the historical breakout for absentee ballots is about  republican in  when al gore won the popular vote nationally by  votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder there were  million absentee ballots in california alone a  breakout of those yields a  to million republican vote advantage so bush would have gotten a vote margin from californias uncounted absentee ballots alone so much for gores  popular vote victory that was the headline on the ny times and it was the lead story on nbc nightly news right no youre kidding 
getting back to the win the popular votelose the electoral college scenario thank gd we have that or else california and ny would determine every election every time 
but the electoral college brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say as do madison ave execs and factory workers in tennessee

Roosh Valizadeh,donald trump elected th president of the united states,"leave a reply 
bill still  good morning im still reporting on chan 
if truepundit is right again then there are movements of fbi agents tonight that suggest a massive raid happening tomorrow in the dc metro area that may involve arrests and seizure of evidence in the clinton foundation investigation 
i think i can hear the sound of thousands of computers being scrubbed by bleachbit from leesburg virginia to bowie maryland when i walk outside and if so then tomorrow a mighty blow for freedom will be struck as the first step towards the restoration of the rule of law is taken 
but first this letter from anonymous writing on chan making some interesting predictions 
first of all what is chan 
see also sr   huma abedin flipped in nypd slimy sex probe  crooked hillary may be involved 
it is a message board that is designed from the ground up to be totally anonymous users dont even have to pick a username posts are time sensitive  less time for rrated discussion threads  more time for g or pg rated ones so the reliability of the comments can only be judged by knowledge of the context surrounding the comments 
i did a story on chan on aug   still report   since i thought it was true i ran the story then now it no longer seems a bit flaky because much of it has panned out 
the particular chan thread that pertained to whether or not hillary clinton would not be recommended for indictment by fbi director jim comey was announced by an anonymous fbi analyst 
now management of the thread has apparently been taken over by anonymous the previous author may have met his fate at the hands of the conspirators attempting to steal the american election what follows is the message dated nov    
over the next few days many new documents will be released the contents of these documents will contain evidence of perhaps the largest coverup in american history 
before this happens we would like to explain ourselves and answer a few questions you may have 
until this month wikileaks and anonymous have worked together building an efficient detailed comprehensive set of documents that would be responsible for the incarceration of hillary clinton bill clinton and  individuals ranging from the dnc fbi cia and clinton foundation 
these documents will show without a doubt the evidence of treason obstruction of justice election fraud manipulation and bribery 
this was intended to be the october surprise but before the release of these documents we were contacted by a member of the fbi as well as another from the cia and a week later by the nypd all with information pertaining to something much darker than even we imagine due to the nature of these leaks we all work together as efficiently as possible to ensure two objectives  that all necessary information would be given to the public in an organized searchable manageable way  those who provided us with this information would be able to find safety before these releases were made this concern wasnt without warrant 
the new leaks being released this week will provide documents in the form of emails pictures and videos within these will be evidence of bill clinton as well as at least six other government officials taking part in sexual acts with minors as well as evidence of human trafficking that also included minors we believe these pictures and videos were taken for the purpose of political manipulation in order to make sure all participants followed through on a previously agreed agenda 
these documents were given to us by an american government official when he had come to learn that this crime had been covered up by hillary and her staff through methods including bribery and blackmail he also told us that due to the restricted access of these documents they would soon know he was the one who released them to us we were trying to make arrangements for him to exit the country safely but he was killed before those arrangements could be carried out

Kim Petersen,jordanian bedouin poet proposes to tiffany trump asks her to wear burka,"november   by aht staff egypt says no to saudi drafts generals and pilots to fight alongside syrian army against isis syria finds new partner in fight against isis  shares  
the small jump needed for egyptiansyrian relations to go back to normal that syrian prime minister walid almuallem spoke of has been achieved apparently mohammad ballout from assafir lebanese daily  reported that some egyptian military formations have recently arrived to syria signaling an end to the time where egypt simply stood by hands crossed looking at the goingson in syria 
it seems that the egyptians have sent  helicopter pilots to the hamah airbase and it is hoped that they will see action in joint egyptiansyrian operations 
four senior egyptian military figures also joined the unit when it first came to syria and two major generals have been operating at the armed forces staff headquarters in damascus near the operations room the two major generals have been touring the fronts since they arrived a month ago and have been reviewing the efforts made at the fronts most recently the southern front at quneitra 
these new developments are apparently the result of intensive unannounced high profile security meetings that began over a year ago between cairo and damascus arab sources also expect that these developments will go beyond these symbolic operations and will see egyptian task forces operating on a large scale in support of the syrian army 
moreover a senior syrian security official also said that the egyptians have promised to send forces to syria and have schedule postdecember rd as the zerohour whereupon egyptian participation in syria will escalate another official also revealed that after december a large number of egyptian forces will also participate in the syrian operations and their participation will not be limited to aerial support more",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,5.755236223263406,71,12,1858,299,5.1806020066889635,299.0,0.2764223950044397,0.3616742515005802,-0.2965312771428819,-0.3092182951978666,0.0902817063606126,-0.3048502785179166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.8769,0.066,0.024,0.91,Positive,Very Strong

William Adams,what modern south korea is like,"home  badge abuse  genius child arrested interrogated and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock genius child arrested interrogated and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock john vibes september    comments 
irving tx  an intelligent and talented th grader was arrested this week for bringing a homemade clock into school yearold ahmed mohamed is interested in electronics and has taught himself how to make his own radios and other devices he can even repair his own gokart 
recently he made a clock that he was proud of so he decided to take it into school and show his classmates and teachers sadly instead of celebrating his achievement one of his teachers called the police on him because they thought that it might be a bomb 
when the police arrived they took the threat seriously and believed that it could be a bomb as well even though it obviously wasnt eventually the police charged him with making a clock and misrepresenting it as a bomb even though he consistently told everyone that it was a clock and denied that it was a bomb when the teachers or the police suggested it 
the young man was then handcuffed and taken to a juvenile detention center and his clock was taken and put in an evidence room he was also suspended from school and was unable to attend a student council meeting that he was scheduled to be a part of 
here in high school none of the teachers know what i can do ahmed told dallas news after the incident 
he then explained that when he showed his engineering teacher what he created he was warned not to show it to the other teachers 
he was like thats really nice i would advise you not to show any other teachers ahmed said 
he then kept the clock in his bag until his english class when the alarm went off and disturbed his teacher after the class ahmed showed his teacher what was making the noise and she accused him of bringing a bomb to school 
she was like it looks like a bomb he said 
i told her it doesnt look like a bomb to me he explained 
the teacher took the clock from him and he had expected that was the end of it however towards the end of the day ahmed was pulled out of class and taken to a room filled with police officers 
he said that the officers then attempted to get him to admit that he tried to make a bomb 
they were like so you tried to make a bomb  ahmed said 
i told them no i was trying to make a clock 
the officer then told him  it looks like a movie bomb to me 
the police even admit that ahmed never once said the device was a bomb and they never had any reason to believe that it actually was one but the police still seemed to think he was lying about something even though they didnt have any proof 
we have no information that he claimed it was a bomb he kept maintaining it was a clock but there was no broader explanation police spokesman james mclellan said 
it could reasonably be mistaken as a device if left in a bathroom or under a car the concern was what was this thing built for do we take him into custody he added 
they couldnt possibly imagine that a young man would want to teach himself a valuable skill and share his achievement with his teachers 
they thought how could someone like this build something like this unless its a threat ahmed said 
ahmeds father mohamed elhassan mohamed believes that his family is being discriminated against 
he just wants to invent good things for mankind but because his name is mohamed and because of sept  i think my son got mistreated he said 
there has since been an outpour of support on social media since ahmeds story went public he has even gotten support from mark z and president obama cool clock ahmed want to bring it to the white house we should inspire more kids like you to like science its what makes america great

Daniel Haiphong,things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency," shares
   
as donald trump gains more bad press hilary clinton rides the political wave with quick responses deflections and denials without question and largely due to trumps obnoxious candor and grandiose proclamations she is working her way back into the favor of disgruntled democrats and even right wing firebrands like the notorious glenn beck she is without question a wolf in sheeps clothing while trump is unbelievably hard to take constantly we need to focus on one simple question which of these candidates will lead to world devastation first
i suspect it would be hillary clinton who would be most inclined toward involving americans in another military conflict and she doesnt go small as she constantly demonizes russia with threats of military action in clintons own words youve seen reports russia has hacked into a lot of things china has hacked into a lot of things russia even hacked into the democratic national committee maybe even some state election systems so weve got to step up our game make sure we are well defended and can take the fight to those who go after us as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses
military responses to a nation the us stood on the verge of war with for more than four decades military response against russia over suspected hacking hillary clinton betrayed her real mindset once and for all during the recent debate with donald trump when she spoke those words of war that would surely lead to only disastrous consequences
it all stems from the wikileaks release that included  emails and  attachments from leaders at the democratic national committee clinton says the russians did it the national mainstream media parroted those words its the american medias political conditioning system at its finest convincingly reaching tens of millions of americans and yet nobody knows if the blame is properly attributed to the russians in a usa today article from july  elizabith weise wrote computer security researchers say its difficult to definitively say the cyber theft of files from the democratic national committee subsequently posted online by wikileaks was the work of russian hackers as some media outlets have reported
russias leader vladmir putin says the us long ago tipped the scales in the wrong direction well before the cold war even ended peace with russia should be a top priority for any us presidential candidate the truth is that american politicians perpetually convinced they are making the right political moves created a road block on the highway to peace during the vietnam war putin said during the st petersburg international economic forum  it is not in my nature to scold someone  but when the united states unilaterally withdrew from the abm treaty in  they delivered a colossal blow to the entire system of international security that was the first blow when it comes to assessing the strategic balance of power in the world
more  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital voting for the lesser evil now we have clinton warmongering over unfounded allegations
world rivals in the air
there is a decadesold history of rivalry between eastern and western jet fighter design and technology while american designs are more expensive and generally considered to be better the fastest jet fighter ever made is the russian mig it can break mach iii more than three times the speed of sound such demands lessen the life of an aircraft the mig is typically not flown at anything close to that speed as an interceptor however it was supreme no allied fighter in the sky could outrun it
the korean war was the first test soviet migs initially dominated the skies with russian and chinese pilots often at the controls the migs were deadly
on  november  at least sixteen american f fighters p mustangs were shot at by six soviet mig interceptors led by soviet wwii ace mayor nikolay v stroykov the wwii prop planes like the mustang along with the us f shooting star and f thunderjet jet fighters had a job on their hands fighting the robust and highly maneuverable mig fighters
everything changed when the us air force launched the f sabre wikipedia explains that the f sabre pilots enjoyed advantages they learned to exploit to the fullest foremost among those was a radar ranging gun sight on their six  caliber machine guns which ensured that even short bursts of fire generally found their target f pilots were also equipped with gsuits which prevented pilot blackout in highspeed turning maneuvers
it is unlikely that anybody will ever fully agree on the casualties and kill ratios over mig alley during the korean war
the soviets claimed  united nations planes of all types shot down including about  sabres the usaf only admits to losing less than  aircraft in air combat
the f pilots claimed  migs shot down while b gunners claimed a further  these numbers were later reduced to  migs the chinese air force claimed only  kills
in vietnam the competitors varied the mig and mig fighters were widely used by the north vietnamese air force they fought planes like the f super sabre f tiger and the f phantom once again if you believe western sources which are fairly reliable for the most part the us planes dominated in most air to air combat though the other side had plenty of talented pilots and more aces overall than the americans during the end of the cold war in the s the soviet mig was the terror of the skies there was more speculation about it than real knowledge at first while mig aircraft were only built in odd numbers the movie top gun references the aircraft by calling them migs  migs no ones been this close before the planes used in the movie were actually american f tigers painted black with red stars applied to the tails today the united states spends obscene amounts on planes like the f raptor and these aircraft do not have any clear advantages over modern russian planes like the su both in this case are capable of thrust vectoring which means the pilot can change the direction of the jet blast and create an entirely separate way to control the jet in flight the ultimate western jet in the world of thrust vectoring is the avb harrier which can actually take off and land like a helicopter hopefully the world will not have to put these machines against each other in a future war but with clinton at the helm it is entirely possible and the advantages the us used to hold over the russian military have evaporated into thin air
russias modern approach to warfare
during the decadeslong cold war the soviet union operated under archaic rules that essentially prevented a commander or a pilot from knowing their mission until they were dispatched to carry out the order kemp freund a us army sergeant major that i met while i was covering the war in afghanistan was quote d in my  video report camp joyce remote fire base near afghanistanpakistan border saying were trying to break the old soviet methods that they use and the soviet method had that lt col completely in the dark until he needed to move he added were still working with the higher echelons to get that to move downhill the soviet ways were detrimental and offered little freedom to a trained soldier or pilot but all that is over now todays russian pilots not only fly superior aircraft that cost far less than us taxpayer funded military planes they also utilize tactics of western pilots hillary clinton surely knows these facts but she wants to play with fire and be another war president which was so important to former president george w bush and obama too for that matter

the democratic coalition against trump released a statement announcing their complaint the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint with the department of justice office of professional responsibility on friday against fbi director james comey for interfering in the presidential election following the fbis decision to open up an investigation into secretary clintons emails this close to election day federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act 
it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only  days to go before the election said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house just to undermine her campaign comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america not investigating our soon to be presidentelect hillary clinton

director comeys motives for sending the letter  days before a presidential election have been questioned by both republicans and democrats 
if comeys actions were politically motivated he would be in violation of the hatch act

two bill clinton cronies used their private consulting firm to steer millions in business to the former president while raising funds for the clinton foundation  and even called the arrangement bill clinton inc 
doug band a top clinton aide detailed the complex financial arrangement between his company teneo and the foundation in a memo contained in hacked emails released wednesday by wikileaks 
teneo partners have raised in excess of  million for the foundation more than  million of which is in the bank the memo reads 
teneo partners also have generated over  million in paid speeches for president clinton  million of which has been paid to him thus far 
the consulting company was formed by band and former state department envoy declan kelly the memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president 
in one arrangement kelly introduced bob mccann the head of ubs wealth management to clinton at an event in  
after the meeting mccann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting clinton to give several paid speeches 
another arrangement involved the laureate foundation which donated more than  million to the clinton global initiative 
laureate was a personal advisory services business the memo said paying clinton ?million annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman 
the cozy relationship with the clintons put the baltimorebased laureate at highprofile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe 
the band memo also includes a section about forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc 
some of the speeches secured by teneo include two  addresses delivered to ubs in  and  as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches if he chose to give them 
another secured event was a  million fee for clinton to speak at two onehour sessions during an event in hong kong the fee included  for a private plane 
since  president clintons business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements the memo reads 
the relationship between band and the donors was criticized harshly by daughter chelsea clinton in another email 
chelsea specifically called out band and teneo for hustling business opportunities out of the foundation 
i continue to want  and to try  to disintermediate myself from this muddle edify the corporate audit and existential process we are in  while also being a responsible board member daughter and person chelsea wrote in the  email 
the relationship between foundation donors and hillary clintons state department was raised through emails obtained by citizens united in which top hillary aide huma abedin appeared to vet donors access to the clintons based on their links to the cgi

hillary clinton declared during nbc newss commanderinchief forum that no lives were lost in libya when she made the move to take out dictator muammar gaddafi even so the former secretary of state did not mention the fact that  months later four americans  including us ambassador christopher stevens  were killed in a terrorist attack in benghazi that arose from the instability that the overthrow created 
that was one of the few situations in american foreign policy decision making processes where everybody came together to make sure we dont make the wrong move and the operation was a success even donald trump supported it clinton argued as with any operation of such magnitude we had a few hiccups but it was nothing out of the ordinary as ive said the operation was a success 
she continued so much so in fact that im proud to say that no important people were lost through it all and when i say that i say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that libyans could be freed from the iron fist of gaddafi it would have been unrealistic to expect  casualties however the overall toll did not exceed expectations with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy 
politics can be a cruel line of work that being said i stand before you here today and i am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it and while were on the subject of sacrifices thank god they did not include anyone important from the american delegation including yours truly she said jokingly causing the auditorium to laugh 
she said but all jokes aside i have to pay homage to the cia who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day its agents work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come if it hadnt been for them we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations i am proud that the united states of america has an intelligence agency such as the cia 
im sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay a bargain if you will when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist i would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region for better of worse we acted and i am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the cia out of a deal because in the words of a personal friend of mine who is a former cia spook  shutting down arms dealers is easy finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part she concluded",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,86,15,2877,526,4.448669201520913,526.0,0.7350479851506798,0.9253763973803462,-0.0269327459037221,0.0466452441466157,-0.6320641912129149,0.0593332107808722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9925,0.187,0.116,0.697,Positive,Very Strong

David G. Brown,federal jury finds uva rape hoax journalist sabrina rubin erdely and rolling stone liable for defamation,"the media is beginning to demonize the manosphere and alt right twitter has suspended multiple accounts such as milo yiannopoulos ricky vaughn and matt forney the guardian wrote a hit piece against the red pill  the media has called altright groups xenophobic racist and misogynist despite not pointing to a single piece of evidence
as antitrump rallies continue to rage across the nation in new york city philadelphia and michigan the media completely ignores all of the assaults occurring on trump voters

despite the elites attempts to destroy us we are in fact winning this battle the reasons why are simple
truth is always more powerful than falsehood we are too numerous to be effectively silenced we dont congregate on one single platform were a collection of individuals based around an ideology were high energy decisive assertive and confident men below i would like to offer the supporters of our causes some signs of hope victory is near and trump is going to lead the way
 george soros being sued for  million 
according to breitbart  along with dozens of other alternative news sites dallas police department sergeant demetrick pennie president of the dallas fallen officer foundation is suing a multitude of individuals for inciting a race war
george soros hillary clinton jesse jackson barrack obama the new black panthers and more some individuals might claim that theres no way someone can take on this collection of massively powerful and wealthy elites in a single lawsuit and they may be right however whether or not this lawsuit is successful is completely irrelevant
what matters far more is that the word is starting to get out there the president of the dallas fallen officer foundation an extremely reputable organization is taking steps to file a massive lawsuit against these individuals this will at the very least do several things
potentially serve a massive blow to the globalists show the elites that we will not back down generate huge amounts of public awareness show the average gun rights promoting masculine traditional american that they have our support and best of all the lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of texas which means that the outcome will generally be good either way
first of all theres a very high likelihood of them winning due to the case being handled in texas a highly conservative state second in the event that the case doesnt win it will likely be pursued all the way to the supreme court if this occurs expect truly amazing things to happen the reason why the president of the united states is responsible for appointing supreme court judgesand guess whos going to be president in two months
 the grubhub crash 
after matt maloney ceo of the online food delivery service grubhub proclaimed in an email that if you agree with trumps politics you should resign their stock dropped by nearly  in just a few days
since this time in addition to his companys stock tanking he has received ample backlash on sites of all manner from twitter to facebook to reddit to independent blogs to major altright news centers
this is what my fellow rok contributors and manosphere bloggers were talking about when they mentioned the tangible impact of trump voters hillarys supporters lack the characteristics necessary to make change
a burning passion and sense of purpose moral fortitude and a sense of justice selfconfidence and the courage to stand up for your rights a fucking spine this is why we will win period the antitrump crowd is based around having a massive entitlement complex a victim complex not thinking for yourself and being a blind social sheep do people like this ever have any political or financial power in the world
of course not who do you think all of the hard working businessmen are all of the entrepreneurs all of the people investing in the stock market in order to take control of their financial future hard working intelligent men who dont make excuses obviously and do you know what these are the types of men that voted for donald trump
why do you think the dow jones industrial average is at an all time high because trumps win restored faith in america
 rise of the new media 
the mainstream media has repeatedly shown to be completely incompetent in regards to actually reporting on the issues they are nothing more than a puppet show meant to distract entertain and brainwash the american public
they have consistently lied about candidates manipulated the evidence falsified facts skewed statistics and polls and defamed multiple individuals for a mere political opinion this will happen no longer
with the rise of the new media more and more men have begun establishing outlets across all platforms reddit twitter facebook youtube periscope the list goes on and on
i firmly believe that the next eight years will be looked back on by historians as one of the most important times in all of humanitys time on this earth 
america has brought the world stability we have stood as a symbol and an ideal for other countries to follow we are a monolith of free speech bravery and economic prosperityand the elites have tried to destroy all of this to satisfy their greedy little egos
the men of america will not have this over the past  years cough obamas presidency cough we have seen an exponential increase in not only the quantity of alternative news outlets but also the quality
sites that were merely blogs a few years ago have evolved into fullblown news syndicates with live reporting onsite video footage and actual news anchors this is literally the people fighting back we want freedom of speech and we will have it
while the mainstream media draws its final breath theyre proclaiming that theres this new radical whitenationalist group called the altright in an attempt to make us look like evil fascists in fact i just had somebody threaten to kill me on twitter  but was he banned of course not
this repeated favoring of violent mentally ill leftists makes it very clear what the msms agenda istotal control and a complete suppression of our freedoms of speech sorry but the alternative media isnt going to let this happen
 massive boycotts of antitrump companies 
the lefts hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me somehow they can completely legally destroy an independent family owned business for simply refusing to bake a gay couple a cake but when trump supporters simply boycott a multibillion dollar conglomerate were the ones that are hateful
in response to several ceos statements regarding trumps racism and hate the men and women who voted for donald trump decided to simply boycott them despite this completely legal and antiviolent response the left is up in arms
here is a list of companies whose ceos have been caught attacking donald trump and his proamerican policies
pepsico they own pepsi lays mountain dew starbucks and more nabisco their brands include oreo chips ahoy ritz and more netflix macys ben  jerrys each and every single one of these companies has either spoken out against trump directly has refused to do business with trump or has moved factory production outside of the us such as nabisco which has started moving production to mexico some companies such as ben  jerrys have even openly supported the terrorist movement black lives matter 
again what do these actions signify in trump supporters power assertiveness courage a willingness to take action this is why donald trump wonhis supporters are grown ups not little babies who want more safe spaces and antifree speech zones
when donald trumps voters get oppressed by the biased controlled media or by elite globalists they dont whine or cry about it they just do something they protest and stop supporting companies that are shipping our jobs away they speak out in a logical rational way against the anger and hatred that the left has towards white men
they take their lives into their own hands rather than relying on a stupid system that caters to cry babies and whiners they take their health into their own hands they take their finances into their own hands and they take their relationships into their own hands
they dont wait around for someone else to do it for themthey get it done themselves this is why trump got into office and this is why were going to make america great again

Matthew Vadum,bank fines elect democrats,"the psychopathic and insincere jihad islams natural appeal to criminals psychopaths and murderers october   
raymond ibrahim is a shillman fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
whenever muslims engage in behavior that ostensibly contradicts islamfrom taking drugs and watching porn to killing fellow muslims islams apologists loudly proclaim aha see theyre not true muslims or in the words of cia head john brennan on the islamic state they are terrorists theyre criminals mostmanyof them are psychopathic thugs murderers who use a religious concept and masquerade and mask themselves in that religious construct 
overlooked is that many selfstyled jihadis are indeed psychopathic thugs murderers some may not even believe in allah at all yet this does not exonerate islam for its religious construct was designed to entice such men 
as usual  this traces back to the prophet muhammad after telling his followers that allah had permitted muslims four wives and limitless concubines koran  he later claimed that allah had delivered a new revelation koran  permitting him muhammad alone to marry and sleep with as many women as he wanted in response his young wife aisha quipped i feel that your lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires apostates from islam regularly cite this episode as especially disenchanting them with the prophet 
but it is the concept of jihad that especially comports with those who seek to indulge their carnal appetites for whoever fights in the name of allah andor seeks to empower islamthat is jihadisterroristsis exonerated of all blame and if he dies fighting guaranteed the highest levels of paradise where more sex awaits 
thats because allah made a pact with them according to koran  allah has bought from the believers their lives and worldly goods and in return has promised them paradise they shall fight in the way of allah and shall slay and be slain rejoice then in the bargain you have struck for that is the supreme triumph muhammad elaborated lining up for battle in the path of allah jihad to empower islam is worthier than  years of worship moreover the martyr is special to allah he is forgiven from the first drop of blood that he sheds he sees his throne in paradise he will wed the aynhour supernatural celestial women designed exclusively for sexual purposes and will not know the torments of the grave and safeguards against the greater horror hell fixed atop his head will be a crown of honor a ruby that is greater than the world and all it contains and he will copulate with seventytwo aynhour 
as for those muslims who reject jihad muhammad said they will be tortured like no other sinful human for many more islamic scriptures depicting jihad as the greatest undertaking one that earns unconditional forgiveness and paradise see here  
there is no denying that the historic growth of islam is related to its carnal incentives after more than a decade of preaching in mecca muhammad had about  followers mostly relatives it was only when he became a successful warlord and caravan raider that his followers grew and multiplied so long as such fighters helped spread the banner of islam into infidel lands they were deemed good and pious muslimsregardless of their true intentions priorities or even faith 
many of the original jihadis now revered in islamic hagiography were by modern standards little more than mass killing psychotics consider khalid bin alwalid a meccan pagan he opposed muhammad for years but when the prophet seized mecca khalidlike many of muhammads foes such as his archenemy abu sufyanexpediently converted proclaimed the shahada  joined the winning team and then went ajihadingmutilating plundering raping enslaving crucifying and setting people on fire in the process but because he did so under the banner of jihad this serial killer and rapist is today one of islams most revered heroes 
the reason for this is that nowhere in islam is there talk about the condition of the jihadis heart or if hes right with god allah is not god he is not interested in hearts and minds but in fighters and swords so long as his fighters proclaim the shahada there is no god but allah and muhammad is his messengerand fight under the banner of islam they can take plunder murder and rape the infidels and if they die doing so they go to paradise 
such was the genius of muhammad in the arabian society he lived in members of ones tribe were as inviolable as nonmembers were free game to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity muhammad took this idea and infused it with a pious rationale henceforth there would be only two tribes in the world the umma which consists of all muslims regardless of raceand the infidels who deserve to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity for rejecting allah 
this explains why other tribalnomadic societiesturks and mongolstatars whose way of life consisted of preying on everyone outside their tribealso converted to islam and under the banner of jihad continued preying on the other the infidel but now as venerated champions of the faith 
christian europe was aware of islams true appeal from the very beginning theophanes the byzantine scholar d  wrote the following about muhammad in his chronicles he taught those who gave ear to him that the one slaying the enemyor being slain by the enemyentered into paradise see koran  and he said paradise was carnal and sensualorgies of eating drinking and women also there was a river of wine  and the women were of another sort and the duration of sex greatly prolonged and its pleasure longenduring eg koran     and all sorts of other nonsense 
centuries later st thomas aquinas d  made similar observations he muhamad seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges us his teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure in all this as is not unexpected he was obeyed by carnal men as for proofs of the truth of his doctrine muhammad said that he was sent in the power of his armswhich are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants what is more no wise men men trained in things divine and human believed in him from the beginning those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers utterly ignorant of all divine teaching through whose numbers mohammed forced others to become his followers by the violence of his arms 
there is finally another group of muslims who should not be overlooked these do not give a fig for allah nor wish to be martyred in exchange for paradise but they rely on islam to justify robbing enslaving raping and killing nonmuslims as many christian minorities in nations like pakistan and egypt will attest because their victims are just infidelsand its a sin to aid a nonmuslim against a muslim that is a nontribal member against a tribal membermuslim criminals target nonmuslim minorities precisely because they know muslim authorities will not do a thing on behalf of the victimized infidels 
in short enough of these claims that this or that jihadi is in the words of the cias brennan terrorists criminals psychopathic thugs and murderers yes they are but that doesnt change the fact that one group of them is convinced that no matter how immoral or perverse their behavior is as long as they continue fighting and dying in the name of jihad paradise is assured them and another group doesnt care a bit about the afterlife but knows that as long as they only victimize infidels no muslim will hold them accountable in both cases islam aids and abets their behavior",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,84.45285857853474,26,4,7604,1286,4.887247278382581,1286.0,-1.0994543754342805,-1.141531470845462,1.223697535909338,1.238082644595103,-0.1992306409883481,1.2786259502834252,0.0007776049766718,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0019261015643849,-0.9914,0.145,0.172,0.684,Negative,Very Strong

Noah Beck,the hostility and hypocrisy of leftwing israeli ngos,"fbi investigates saudi wifeabusing clinton foundation donor in straw donor scheme november   daniel greenfield 
its midnight in america and the clintons and the democratic party keep finding ways to cover themselves in glory im sure the line on this will be that the fbi is acting inappropriately by investigating this investigating political corrupt ion interferes with corrupt politicians being elected 
the fbi is investigating an alleged illegal donation scheme involving a wealthy saudi family that supports democratic florida senate candidate patrick murphy 
murphy who has covered himself in glory so often already is denying everything and i mean absolutely everything 
the murphy campaign declined to say whether the candidate is aware of the fbi probe 
whats your name i decline to answer that question 
murphy  is running against rubio the incumbent republican in a race that could help decide which party controls the senate in  rubio currently leads murphy by an average of  percentage points according to realclearpolitics 
the fbi investigation however relates to murphys first run for the house in the  campaign cycle 
the allegation  originally submitted by a republican super pac run by a former top aide to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky  is that murphys high school friend and major political donor ibrahim alrashid coordinated a straw donor scheme to boost murphy 
murphy knows nothing 
murphys campaign declined to say whether murphys attorneys had discussed the fbi investigation with alrashids attorney 
uhhuh 
alrashid is the son of a powerful and politically connected saudi billionaire hes been a major financial benefactor of murphys giving almost  to his campaigns and to outside groups supporting the florida congressman 
heres how some of these donations worked 
one example within the alleged scheme a woman who describes herself in federal donation reports as the owner and property manager of a texasbased company limestone property management gave murphys campaign  
but she is neither the property manager nor the owner of the texasbased company in fact she doesnt work there 
she lived in miami at the time and was ibrahim alrashids cleaning lady according to a miamidade police department report filed in  over a home burglary at alrashids property 
texas property manager vs saudis cleaning lady thats quite a difference 
murphy has been forced to return alrashids donations before for purely islamophobic reasons 
alrashids three sons have followed in their fathers political footsteps contributing large sums to top democrats including rep patrick murphy d fla whose senate race could help decide which party controls the senate in  
murphy has already returned a portion of alrashids donations due to his involvement in a domestic assault incident 
ibrahim alrashid allegedly forced his way into his estranged wifes pennsylvania home where alrashid allegedly grabbed her by the wrist struck her about the head and face with a closed fist then threw her to the ground according to a copy of the police report viewed by the free beacon 
following the  incident alrashid allegedly sent his wife a text message stating i am not sorry this time i hope you die in hell according to the police report 
murphy a longtime friend of alrashid was recently forced to donate around  in campaign funds to domestic violence groups after the assault charge became a public liability for the campaign murphy also returned all of the donations made by alrashid during the last three political cycles 
is the clinton foundation involved in this do the clintons do their business in golden and marble toilets 
nasser alrashid one of saudi arabias wealthiest figures and an adviser to the countrys royal family has donated somewhere between  million to  million to the clinton foundation putting him in an elite category of prominent donors

Hrafnkell Haraldsson,in the first  days of october trump gave just k to his own campaign,"by hrafnkell haraldsson    am we cant do waterboarding its far too tough were fighting on a different level we have to be toughand in some cases pretty vicious   
donald trump complains about spending a fortune on a war in the middle east that he supported a war brought to us by a republican administration that knowingly lied about the facts trump is also lying about the facts which at least brings our countrys middle east ordeal fullcircle 
according to trump speaking at a rally in new mexico  and youve no doubt seen the barrage of commercials repeating the same lie  hillary brought disaster to iraq syria libya and every place that she touches she empowered iran and she unleashed isis by leaving that big vacuum 
of course it was republican president george w bush who negotiated the balance of forces agreement with iraq stipulating that america draw down its combat strength reneging on that agreement would have meant not peace in iraq or a negation of isis but a second us invasion on top of the rise of isis 
we want peace through strength trump told the crowd we dont want to be in wars but these savages are chopping off heads 
well in fact we did want to be in that war we invaded iraq not vice versa 
trump went on to say 
drowning people in steel cages burying people in the sand we havent had  this is medieval times this is medieval times and then we cant do waterboarding its far too tough you know were fighting on a different level see were fighting on a different level folks and we have to be tough and we have to be smart and we have to be in some cases pretty vicious to be honest with you pretty vicious but we have to take them out and then we have to get back to building our country because our country  weve spent  trillion in the middle east  trillion and we couldve rebuilt our country twice 
never mind for a moment that torture is illegal under international law never mind that a  senate intelligence committees report said torture doesnt work trumps argument sounds once again like a child wanting to get back at another child who has aggrieved him 
this is trump wanting to spite his enemies on an international scale and arguing to boot that the end justifies the means 
he doesnt because he cant prove that acting like barbarians somehow doesnt make us barbarians ourselves he certainly cant prove because that senate report says otherwise that torturing people will win the war 
the claim of  million by the way is one trump made last week in charlotte nc as well and politifact ruled it half true at the time saying 
trump is citing the highend estimate of credible analyses of spending associated with the wars in iraq and afghanistan yet he is confusing money thats been spent with money that researchers say will be spent 
the point here is that this is a war begun not by obama and certainly not by hillary clinton who at least admits she supported it and has apologized for doing so while trump continued to deny he was ever for it despite the facts to the contrary 
when trump says we have to be pretty vicious he is also saying we have to be pretty dishonest and nobody lies with such success or at such a rate as donald trump 
trump has said he loves war he has said he likes to be unpredictable he has asked why we cant use nuclear weapons since we have them this is a man most national security experts say should not have the nuclear football in his hands 
this is a man who no matter how much he claims otherwise does not understand how the world works and he does not understand that by promoting torture he is only fulfilling the wildest propaganda wishes of the islamic state by promising to do precisely what they want him to do",politicususa.com,Real,english,100.0,88.90571715706947,67,14,3689,674,4.431750741839763,674.0,0.154122237632109,0.7374756820870908,0.1878994497451471,0.278662001076058,-0.6487610517138397,0.2967744284734747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.9816,0.143,0.171,0.686,Negative,Very Strong

Jason Easley,sean hannity spreads fake news story to millions as republicans remain brainwashed,"military an mq reaper remotely piloted aircraft flies by during a training mission november   at creech air force base in indian springs nevada photo by afp 
the us military forces have secretly been using an airbase in tunisia for drone operations to gather intelligence from inside oilrich libya officials say 
the announcement was made by unnamed sources cited in a washington post report on wednesday 
libya has been struggling to contain the daesh takfiri terrorists who started expanding their presence in the country following the overthrow and death of longtime dictator muammar gaddafi in  
the base has apparently been in use since late june in an alleged effort to support the libyan governments fight against the terrorists currently in control of the northern city of sirte 
the us has also been using bases in niger and djibouti but those ones are farther away 
efforts by the administration of president barack obama to access the airbase were meant to keep drones and small special operations teams within striking distance of the militants and close a blind spot for us and western spy agencies 
the officials also asserted that the drones were unarmed and tasked with gathering intelligences adding they could be armed in the future if tunis agrees 
the tunisian government is yet to issue a possible response to the report 
drones tasked with assassination in the north african country usually fly out of naval air station sigonella on the italian island of sicily 
the reason for keeping use of the airbase secret has been mentioned as part of the obama administration efforts not to harm tunisias young democracy as put by the washington post  
washington conducts targeted killings through remotelycontrolled armed drones in several african and middle eastern countries 
the united states claims the airstrikes target members of alqaeda and other militants but according to local officials and witnesses civilians have been the victims of the attacks

Bob Menefee,no title,"state that fired pastor demands his sermons notes this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority published  mins ago about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in  after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print dr eric walsh photo first liberty 
the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church 
but dr eric walsh is resisting issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers 
the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations 
hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons 
walshs ordeal began in may  when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency only a week later a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventhday adventist church 
lee rudd the agencys human resources director then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately two days later walsh was fired 
at that point lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks chesin  walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency 
police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the constitution order today 
now in response to walshs lawsuit the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands among a flood of other paperwork copies of his sermon notes and transcripts 
this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church said jeremy dys senior counsel for first liberty 
no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so 
officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general who did not respond to a request for comment 
walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support 
on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code 
wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile filthy blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen 
the mayor at the time annise parker withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest  
in a prepared statement wednesday on walshs case welch said i cant believe im saying this but georgias demand is even worse than when the mayor of houston demanded  different categories of materials including sermons from  us 
welch the executive director of the texas pastor council said what is happening to walsh is worse than what happened in houston for multiple reasons 
first this is state government coming after a pastor not just a rogue mayor in one city he said also the state is demanding much more material sermons sermon notes all documents without even topical or time limits it could even include margin notes in this pastors preaching bible its almost as if they are ransacking the pastors study this sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor every church every denomination and every citizen of faith in america 
leaders of concerned women for america legislative action committee part of the nations largest public policy womens group with  members also came to walshs defense 
penny nance ceo said the words of reverend dr martin luther king jr that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere still reverberate today  especially as we witness the gestapolike tactics of his native state the state of georgias blatant attack on religious freedom as they discriminate against another pastor dr eric walsh is indeed a threat to every american whatever our religious beliefs 
can there be a clearer violation of our first amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor examine and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share 
wnd reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed walshs sermons and then fired him 
no one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon dys told fox news when the case was filed he was fired for something he said in a sermon if the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything the original state investigation of walshs sermons apparently was sparked by one complaint from an official with a county democratic party and gay activist 
state officials also joked about informing walsh of his firing 
the telephone call was between dr patrick oneal an agency official and kate pfirman an agency financial officer the call was captured on an answering machine which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up 
pfirman said and im gonna be very  im gonna try to come off as very cold because i dont want to say very much if i try to make it warm  ive thought that through its gonna just not  theres no warm way to say it anyway 
then there was laughter from both parties 
oneal then said to inform walsh youre out and there was another round of laughter 
its very funny pfirman said

Gillian,november message from archangel michael,"its the sort of story that only feeds existing suspicions that the upcoming presidential election is being rigged to install hillary clinton in the white house regardless of the true vote count 
via truthandaction 

it strikes directly at the heart of the integrity of our election process and has the potential to cast doubt on the legitimacy of candidates who are declared the winners the story in question appeared on the infowars website and while some of the details cannot be confirmed its worth a look 


elections in the united states do not have a perfect record of being free from attempts to manipulate the results through fraud as reprehensible as that may be its not entirely unexpected considering whats at stake aggressive efforts to insure the integrity of our elections and the prosecution of those who would corrupt them are essential to giving the winning candidates the legitimacy they deserve
all of this has the potential to go out the window this year as accusations of voter fraud through the manipulation of the counting of the ballots are already rampant
a recent story appearing on the infowars news site claims to show that one tv station is already preparing to announce a clinton victory
a nbc station was caught posting election results showing a hillary clinton victory days before the election fueling concerns that the mainstream media is conditioning the public to accept a rigged election favoring hillary
political activists discovered a hidden web site for wrcb out of chattanooga tenn showing election results with hillary clinton securing  electoral votes and  of the popular vote
the web site originated from the ftp server of worldnow a media software company that provides realtime data  such as election results  and other media assets to local news stations
its important to note that although infowars claims that the site is a hidden site for wrcb we at truth and action could not independently verify this  note that infowars states that this hidden web site is located in chattanooga tennessee a search of the domain name returns ohio as the location where the domain name was registered although that is not conclusive either as to the actual location where the site is maintained
even with these doubts about the authenticity of the web site under discussion this news will do nothing to instill confidence but will be one more factor furthering the suspicion and lack of trust surrounding the integrity of this years presidential election
in fact it dovetails nicely with the fractional method of counting the votes previously reported
election fraud expert bev harris was the first to uncover this method which is also known as vote shaving
you need to have votes counted as fractions harris said on the alex jones show monday you need the votes to be counted with decimal places like you count money
if a vote is a dollar you also need to have cents with it that will not show its hidden
vote shaving works by treating votes as decimals rather than whole numbers which allows the machines to allocate the remaining fractional percentages elsewhere to sway election outcomes
theres this one central computer which at the end of the day all the votes come to it harris pointed out thats where you take it you dont run around to  different precincts you wait until the votes come to you and then you have your way with them
all of this is incredibly troubling one ray of hope is that if there really is a concerted effort to rig the vote for hillary that the trump campaign is vigilant and prepared to take all legal measures to expose any vote fraud and insure that the ballots are counted accurately resulting in a decision that truly does represent the will of the people

admin,strange messages coming from the stars are probably from aliens scientists say,"louder with crowder october   
sometimes a thin layer of crust accumulates on the surface of the ocean mostly made up of fecal matter and trash its where environmentalists come from 
they are effectively the pits also environmentalists hate people see top  environmentalists who openly support killing off humans  a side effect of being sad soggy little bottom dwellers so its no surprise they want to kill off coal mines in montana  despite the fact that said coal mines are pillars which help support the economy and the towns well being also electric cars  but whatever 
the  residents in southeast montana face an uphill battle to keep the city alive against an onslaught of legal battles and a major anticoal crusade launched by outsiders 
an out of court agreement was reached to close two of the four units of colstrips coalfired power plant by  the sierra club and the montana environmental information center which sued the plant see the closure as a victory 
plant operators came to an agreement with activists because oregon democratic gov signed legislation mandating the state be coalfree by  
consequences 
its a win for everybody except the people employed by the coal plant also colstrips entire economy coal plant workers make money then spend that money at other businesses except now all those lads will be jobless which means they wont be spending money or helping to boost the economy as much anymore which means other businesses will suffer thanks environmentalists 
by the way green earth sjws tend to also be fans of the indians  the people not the baseball team racist that wee tidbit is worth noting considering how their ecofriendly plan isnt very nativefriendly 
you lose two of those units and you are shutting down half the town small said this closure will have an economic impact on the reservations throughout the county and across the state small is of north cheyenne descent hes made an extra effort to recruit american indian students nearly three dozen northern cheyenne work at the colstrip plant and three times that figure work in the coal fields 
a double header bad for the economy bad for the indigenous people 
as mentioned above the coal plant never stood a chance thanks to impending regulations the plant has long seen the end drawing near possibly because they would rather close indefinitely in order to be spared from ever having to hear another squawking lobbyist attempt to talk them into seeing things their way whatever the reason environmentalists and the state teamed up to bully the coal plant into shutting down now the future of an entire town lies in jeopardy

Letsbereal,nintendo cuts fullyear sales operating profit forecasts,"by day i work in a scrap yard it is not glamorous but glamour does not pay my bills in the evening i teach in a welding program at a community college
like many others i once bought into the fallacy that you need a piece of paper from a university to succeed in life at the age of thirty i graduated from a university with an undergraduate degree and the customary debt which came along with it twentynine years later i see how wrong i was
soon after graduating i obtained an office job and moved to a city where i knew no one the job i was so optimistic about turned out to be like marriage to a crack whore each day was as if walking through a minefield full of dysfunctional women emasculated men drama backstabbing catfights and every other problem associated with modern workplaces worse yet the cut male managers allowed trim to be in charge resulting in a fucked up toxic culture after three tumultuous and abusive years i found myself unceremoniously kicked to the curb and surprisingly relieved
after a lengthy stint of unemployment i landed an entrylevel job in a metal fabrication company one of the benefits offered was tuition reimbursement for work related classes i enrolled in welding classes at night and upgraded my skills all on my employers dime
i immediately noticed a difference from my previous job i worked exclusively with men except for a few token assholes the men liked their solitude did their jobs and left each other alone the work was varied creative and with overtime the pay was decent the fact that i had a work ethic showed up every day on time and desired to learn earned me respect quickly
i eventually went down a different path but returned to welding parttime as an adjunct instructor
welding is the joining of two metal pieces or parts by applying heat a filler metal or electrode helps to make the joint power source supplies electricity required for heat and a shielding gas or fluxcovered electrode aids in the welding process
the most common welding processes are gas metal arc welding gmaw flux core arc welding fcaw gas tungsten arc welding gtaw and shielded metal arc welding smaw of these gas metal arc welding is the easiest to learn and offers the fastest production welding involves both ferrous steel and nonferrous metals aluminum stainless steel
why welding  according to a bureau of labor report the need for welders will grow by  percent by 
 according to a national association of manufacturers report nearly  percent of manufacturers in the united states report that they cannot find skilled welders to meet demand
 the american welding society reports that the average age for a welder is now in the midfifties
 entrylevel wages in my region average  annually with skilled welders earning  and more after five years in the trade
i frequently hear from employers who are desperate for skilled welders one plant manager told me there are too many computer jockeys and not enough people who can weld and turn a wrench another manufacturer told me we have over a dozen welders retiring and no one to replace them further the school i teach at has more jobs available than they have students enrolled
what welders do welders work in manufacturing construction maintenance repair facilities and service companies welders typically work eighthour shifts and a fiveday week but overtime is common welders often perform other duties like operating metal fabrication equipment and doing assembly work
the more skills a welder develops the more value and earning potential he has for example being able to weld cut and fit up metals and read weld symbols and prints will command a higher wage becoming certified in certain weld procedures also increases a welders wages and marketability
qualifications 
welding is the quintessential bluecollar job it is physically demanding hot dirty and requires a high degree of skill other personal characteristics are good eyesight and hand eye coordination good manual dexterity and good concentration
training community colleges offer affordable training for entrylevel jobs in welding most programs are nine months but my school also offers a sixteenweek work ready certificate in welding students learn common welding processes thermal cutting processes and blueprint reading unlike the typical ivory palace college professors instructors are required to have a minimum of three years related and verifiable industrial experience job placement is also good
additional facts 
despite a decent paying skill in high demand clueless parents and educators continue to dissuade young men from entering bluecollar trades like welding the result has been an entire generation of young men ruined by hostile fouryear colleges worthless degrees and insurmountable debt
perhaps you are a perceptive and bright young rok reader considering a career change in closing consider these facts
 you will always have employment as a welder
 welding skills are highly transferable you can carry these skills to your next and often higher paying job
 unlike many whitecollar corporate jobs of today the average welders wages increase with skill overtime merit increases and production bonuses are common benefits for welders
 at the end of your shift you can leave your job at the door
 welding offers a level of creativity solitude and seeing the fruits of your labor studies show that welders machinists and other bluecollar trades have lower suicide rates than many whitecollar professions
 welding is often a gateway trade into other even higher paying trades like machinist multicraft machinery maintenance and millwright
 welding is a male dominated occupation traditionalist men will find it offers some insulation and respite from the typical feminist diatribe and pc bullshit of todays corporate world
conclusion how has welding benefited me first i developed reasoning skills something that academia failed to do i also developed a thorough understanding of how men do the dirty nasty and dangerous jobs in this life feminists and elitists can marginalize men all they want but men risk their lives and health to build and maintain their shit
further welding has opened some doors for me mainly teaching my ultimate goal is to teach welding fulltime a late life career change if you will and one i hope will happen

admin,video rude cnn reporter asks trump why hes taking time off to open a hotel,"ive been living in south east asia for almost a decade now and over that time ive come to have a matured perspective on living here and a fair appreciation of the pros and cons of doing so like most people who come here i set off thinking i was going to live in paradise thats far from the reality let me tell you
living in south east asia has its pros and cons just like anywhere else while i myself have decided to return west for a while ill always have a connection to asia and im sure ill be back many times throughout my life
so whats the real story with living in asia is it all its cracked up to be what does a man have to be aware of when coming here lets look at six common stereotypical ideas about living in south east asia and assess them in the light of reality
 asian women are kind gentle and compliant to their husbands so sweet not so fast
this is most definitely a myth and if you come out here expecting to find some little house pet who does your bidding youll be in for a rude awakening
its definitely true that asian women in my experience are a lot more traditional they give the man his place in the house rarely question your final decisions and do not resent housework and basic wifely duties
however the idea that theyll just do whatever you tell them without question is nonsense theyre human beings with a will of their own and you wouldnt be the first guy to get a smack in the head from a fivefoottwo broad who weighs  pounds if you disrespect her
the idea that asian women are some sort of angelic alternative to western women is also nonsense while its not the norm ive met several western men who have been taken to the cleaners by their asian wives and girlfriends when you move here youre completely at her mercy and you will never have any legal rights as a citizen
asian women generally are a lot more traditional but this stereotype that theyre some sort of perfect wife material has got to go theyre individualsand there are all kinds good and bad among them
read this guide to dating asian women for a more complete perspective on the issue its a thorny subject and theres a lot of misunderstanding surrounding it
 asia is ridiculously cheap 
this is one id have to lean slightly towards agreeing with
most things in asia are a lot cheaper eating out for my entire family often costs less than  meaning i can afford to do it basically every day my rent for a condo apartment costs less than  a month although thats mostly because i live in the sticks and am not in a major city
a general rule of thumb is that outside of major cities like bangkok singapore and kl you can divide the cost of living by three and get a rough estimate
note this does not apply to consumer goods such as cars and electrical appliances which are in and around the same price it certainly does not apply to luxury goods which are often much more expensive because of the taxes placed on them by local governments
asia is cheaper overall but anything other than the basics costs roughly the same life in south east asia can be cheaper but it isnt necessarily soit depends on your lifestyle
 you can become a citizen of an asian country and stay forever becoming a citizen in an asian country is nigh on impossible even if you could you probably wouldnt want to
you can get a variety of visas like permanent residency and each country aims to facilitate the spouses of their nationals and especially retirees with proven cash in the bank however youll not become a citizen with all of the various rights they enjoy
its also worth noting while you might get permanent residence youll never be one of them even if you live here for  years you will always be a foreigner and will be viewed as such by locals this has pros and cons to it but youll never quite feel at home and accepted as one of the group
youll get undue respect from some for being a westerner but forget about talking politics or leveling criticisms at the way things are doneyoull be met with hostility and resentment for the latter
 the weather in asia is  sunshine 
the weather in south east asia is generally pretty awesome and you can live an outdoors life youll truly enjoy if youre that type
the sun shines almost every day and even when its overcast its warm meaning you can go out and about and do anything from walk on the beach to shop in the city
however when the storms come youd better be prepared to get your ass inside the rainfall and wind in many countries in south east asia is truly terrifying just switch on any news station the next time a major storm hits the philippines and youll see what its like
thankfully after  years of living in the philippines  ive never been caught directly in a major storm although ive seen the tail end of plenty of them
the weather is good when its good and utterly awful when its bad check this clip out to see how bad it can get

 asia is  years behind the west in terms of development 
this is a stereotype thats deeply mistaken and whether or not its true depends on which country you go to
true countries like laos and bangladesh are miles behind any western nation but head to singapore and youll be shocked by how far ahead of us they are in terms of tech and development
asia is developing at breakneck pace and with that development comes super highways skytrains skyscrapers and everything else we usually associate with an advanced country it wont be long before many countries out here catch up and surpass the west although it is definitely true that most of them are slightly behind for now
theres a phenomenon called leapfrogging which virtually guarantees asian countries will catch up to and surpass the west quickly leapfrogging is when they can skip all of the evolution and development and simply emulate modern day technology developed elsewherea great example is india where they have skipped the transition from dialup to mobie internet and gone straight from nothing to mobile
if you think this cant be done and there are intellectual property laws to protect tech from being stolen wholesale i salute you but i have to laugh there are no such laws and even if there were nobody would bother to enforce them
on the other hand you still have many scenes like this outside your window when you get out of the main cities

 asians are extremely family oriented again this is one i lean towards agreeing with there are exceptions to every rule but the family unit is extremely strong in asia especially countries like the philippines
i dont want to wax lyrical or speculate as to why this is its enough to acknowledge it as a fact and accept that its the case  of the asian people i have ever met and gotten to know from indonesia to the philippines to thailand are devoted to their families to the extent that wed consider it cultlike in most western countries
i pass no judgment on this whatsoever it can be a great thing or a bad thing depending on your own perspective i personally like it and think its something weve lost in many european countries and america too
this is an idea about asia i agree withthe dedication to family above individuality is definitely true and so by default if you get into a relationship with an asian woman be prepared for this
the family unit is the sun around which everything orbits in most asian countries
living in asia summary sorry to disappoint you fellas but you wont find paradise in south east asia
what you will find is a place with many opportunities pitfalls pros and cons but which i do not regret living in for a single second and which has come to be a large part of my lifes story
i came out for a year and stayed for almost a decade however ive decided that time is now over and its time to go home
id love to hear about your experiences living or traveling in asia do you find my perceptions to be accurate or do you have a different view

the reason why the clinton email scandal is getting pushed  days before the election has nothing to with trumps doa white house bid and everything to do with helping republicans keep control of congress 
on the surface the sudden revival of hillary clintons emails looks like an october surprise designed to help republican nominee donald trump the problem with this theory is that both democrats and republicans acknowledge that trump is toast 
unless hillary clintons emails say lol i was the shooter on the grassy knoll there is nothing that would stop her from winning the election in fact the emails fbi director was investigating did not come from clinton or her server they seem to have very little to do with hillary clinton or her presidential campaign 
the emails are like catnip to republican voters who have been promised for years that if they keep sending republicans to congress theyll bring down a democratic president and that is the real reason behind the email scandal revival 
for the next ten days republican congressional candidates are going to be able to campaign on investigating hillary clinton the republican candidates can pretend like trump doesnt exist because their new pitch to voters is vote for me and ill bring down hillary 
donald trump is a lost cause millions of ballots have already been cast in swing states trump is being out organized and trounced by clinton on the ground

political activist and hillary supporter amal clooney traveled to texas to warn americans about our elected president donald j trump and his tough immigration policies maybe she didnt get the memotrumps tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of gop primary contenders it wasnt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence there will never be a president trump 
perhaps amal shouldve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of american ranchers and threatened the safety and security of american citizens living in homes in or near the us mexican border towns 
amal clooney has warned that many of presidentelect trumps proposals would be violations of international law 
speaking at the texas conference for women at the austin convention center on tuesday the international human rights lawyer and wife of george clooney said she had concerns about americas reputation under the real estate moguls plans 
she noted that trumps comments during his campaign that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the us or the fact that there should be statesponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed  all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that 
the yearold wife said americas reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk 
i think theres some concern from abroad as to are these things actually going to happen or is the us going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally according to the hollywood reporter 
perhaps its time to put our nations security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us 
both amal and her hollywood actor husband george a staunch hillary clinton supporter have spoken out against trump in the past 
earlier this year amal clooney called for trump to be challenged on his extreme views 
watch george clooney here whine about press giving trump too much favorable press

Maximus Decimus Meridius,feminism has lost the minds of young women,"home this month popular what the trump skeptics got wrong what the trump skeptics got wrong fitzroy sommerset 
fitzroy is a british and american nationalist who refuses to apologize for the british empire as a young man he took a presidents shilling and served in the us army in his free time he enjoys studying history and destroying the sjw revisionist narrative november   politics 
there have been few true upsets in our history caesar crossing the rubicon wellingtons victories at assaye and waterloo and washingtons victory at yorktown over the most professional army in the world it is often said that when general charles ohara who had the dubious distinction of surrendering to both george washington and napoleon bonaparte surrendered cornwalliss sword the band played the world turned upside down 
today the establishment and the intellectuals cannot help but share a similar sentiment as cornwallis or ohara did at yorktown and i fully admit in spite of my vote for trump i fully expected him to lose the polls his  negative approval rating and the sheer forces of the media the fbi and even some republicans were arrayed against him my skepticism of trump was not his ideas but his chances of winning the election myself and other conservative intellectual skeptics who voted for him were wrong 
i am one of the intellectuals who expected a trump defeat ive been studying politics history and economics for years reading countless books on the matter from the prince to freakonomics to the wealth of nations 
and i was wrong it was a canadian housewife and an iranian pickup artist who called it correctly for trump trump beat the odds he beat the intellectuals and made the establishment babies in the hands of a giant as was said after napoleons resounding victory at austerlitz in  
the left is currently in panicmode in an attempt to explain how they lost they are calling trump supporters racist sexists homophobic and even sex offenders but in the end it was this same blindness that made them psychologically incapable of defeating donald trump trump was immune to almost all conventional political weapons trump won because of the following 
 the left seemed far more interested in calling trump and his supporters racist than saying something of substance 
 outlets such as the new york times did blatantly stupid crap like try to blame the nra for the orlando shootings and even tried to call them terrorists in this they beat even trump in outrageousness they thought the american people were stupid so they just lied to them and said fuck it those peasants will believe anything we write 
 all trump had to do was call them on their bullshit and call them liars and he was  right the msm has lied to the american people this entire election cycle subsequent to every terrorist attack perpetrated by a muslim the msm continued to push the narrative that home grown rightwing terrorism is the real problem trump called them on their lies and the american people who are tired of being lied to by the msm cheered him on even if he had a few issues with the truth himself 
 the democrats ran the absolute worst candidate possible hillary clinton had negative approval ratings that rivaled trumps own and she was bland and she couldnt decide if she was a moderate or a firebrand progressive and she is corrupt and lied about it stupidly thinking the american people were too ignorant to understand that putting classified information on a private email server is a recklessly irresponsible thing to do 
 trump knew how to communicate with people he knew that whites without a college degree were tired of being talked down to by progressives on the left and genuine intellectuals on the right like myself i freely admit i am guilty of this when you study two thousand years of philosophy economics and rhetoric cicero was particularly effective it is sometimes frustrating when people dont approach a situation in terms of axioms and proofs the working class that built america go by what they feel in their gut and often times they are right 
all in all the left failed because they failed to understand america they bought into the idea that americans are stupidhaha americans are not stupid they may not be smart but they sure as hell know when a liberal taking head is lying to them about now the nra is basically the taliban in an obviously biased hit piece hillary took working class americans for granted and she lost this should stand as a parallel for black americans whom the democrats also take for granted 
i am pleased that donald trump is now presidentelect he wasnt just a candidate he was the anticandidate he did everything a politician should not do he used vulgar language he talked freely about his ideas he made no pretense about being polite to those who are destroying america he turned weaknesses such as his spotty track record into strengths that would have ended any other candidates campaign he was the uncandidate america needed 
i have high hopes for trumps presidency in spite of my tepid support i see trump as a president who can do a lot of good and has the potential to do more good than any president of recent memory 
first trump spat in the face of pc culture and won just as scott walker took on the unions in wisconsin and cucked them by winning the recall election by getting more votes than he did in the previous election trump defeated the sjws if trump can keep this up we can achieve a major strategic victory in the war against political correctness and get back to a concept called actually being correct 
secondly trump is an unapologetic nationalist he loves america and doesnt give a damn if you think howard zinns a peoples history of the united states is a great book the department of cultural guilt that has infected schools in america teaches children to hate their own country i look forward to seeing trump abolish the practice of teaching children that the founding fathers were evil racists the british empire did nothing good for the world and that america is the greatest evil the world has ever seen 
lastly trump is the antithesis of everything the social justice warriors stand for a successful alpha male who tells people to go fuck themselves and still gets elected i hope to see a rise in masculinity in america studies have shown that testosterone levels are down among the american male population this should rise under trump as men embrace their masculinity instead of hiding it for fear of being accused of sexual assault 
i was a trump skeptic i underestimated him i didnt disagree with him on much perhaps maybe  of his platform but i had little faith he could pull it off and i was vocal about my concerns regarding his electability but like the liberals i was wrong and a canadian housewife and a former pickupartistturnedconservativephilosopher were  right 
i recall something i told a fellow soldier while on a long boring convoy operation in iraq when a genius says something others say wow that is way above my head but when a true genius says something others say wow why didnt i think of that before trump is a true genius he stated the obvious to the american people and made them believe he wanted to make america great again and i think he genuinely does he didnt use fancy graphs or focus groups he spoke the truth without political correctness

Daniel Greenfield,black voters not turning out for hillary,"college forces mandatory microaggression sessions on faculty after prof accuses student of plagiarism november   
college is now a politically correct joke  
suffolk universitys interim president said tuesday that the college will hold mandatory microaggression training for all faculty in response to an outcry last week after a latina student wrote a viral blog post saying she was the victim of a professors racial bias 
what did this racial bias involve 
tiffany martinezsaid an unidentified suffolk sociology professor handed back a paper she had written and in front of the class and told martinez this is not your language insinuating that martinez had plagiarized 
martinez posted a photo of the paper on her blog showing where the professor appears to have written please go back and indicate where you cut and paste the professor had circled the word hence in the paper and wrote this is not your word 
in this interaction my undergraduate career was both challenged and critiqued the student wrote it is worth repeating how my professor assumed i could not use the word hence a simple transitory word that connected two relating statements the professor assumed i could not produce quality research 
most college students regardless of whether their ancestors originated from southern europe or not do not tend to use hence in a sentence hence its the sort of word that professors seize on and suspect that what they are seeing is cut and paste material tiffanys interaction has happened thousands of times with students regardless of race 
but tiffany is lucky enough to be a privileged minority which means that she cant be treated like everyone else lest she whine about it and a flood of social justice crybullies descend on suffolk u 
kelly the interim president also sent a note to the school on friday after the buzzfeed article was posted 
the truth is that all of us here at suffolk should be concerned about any student feeling this way kelly wrote in her tuesday blog post she said the school has experienced an outpouring of support for martinez from other students faculty and staff 
privilege this is what it looks like 
scholars and rogues fights a last stand against the decline and fall of journalism by stating the obvious  
in short what we have here isnt merely iffy reporting on an academic dustup its a microcosm of what has happened to journalism in modern america these headlines are certain to entice web surfers to click and if the reporters can so easily be suckered into outrage then how can we possibly expect a rational reading by the average product of the american ed system which has been stripped of all pretense at teaching critical thinking 
the result an emotionally pitched unsubstantiated claim of injustice has been instantly transformed into cold hard fact 
well yes 
meanwhile heres a sample of tiffanys writing you can decide whether she organically used hence in a sentence

Daniel Greenfield,obamas attorney general warned fbi director not to inform congress of new hillary investigation,"media spin the fbis actions are deeply troubling not hillarys

Daniel Greenfield,the bundy verdict is another defeat for obama,"obamas un ambassador cuba is right about our human rights october   daniel greenfield 
you may remember ambassador samantha power from the time she proposed invading israel since then shes gone on to a glorious career of representing the castro regime at the un or is it the obama regime it naturally gets confusing when the us ambassador to the un sides with the enemy against her own country 
for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you 
under obama power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the united states and they say obama is some sort of antiamerican traitor i dont see it if he were we would be seeing signs of it by now 
anyway power then went on to audition for the job of the un ambassador from cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal communist dictatorship about our human rights are wellfounded 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust

the himalayan salt lamps are made from natural himalayan crystal salt rock formed millions of years ago in the foothills of himalaya salt lamps are blocks of pure himalayan salt so they come from the same region of the world also known as the vitamins of the air they are made from the salt that came from ancient oceans and serve as a perfect air ionizer how himalayan salt lamps work 
himalayan salt lamps emit negative ions in the air which are healthy for the human body the ionization is supported by the bulb inside of the salt block since the bulb heats the salt block around it himalayan salt attracts the water around it and this process called as hygroscopic therefore the himalayan salt lamps may become dump or wet especially in an environment with high humidity as the bulb heats the salt lamp the water evaporates and the negative ions are released in the air the negative ions bind with the positive harmful ions such as allergens molds and bacteria and neutralize the environment in the house improve blood flow 
particular studies have suggested that negative ions such as those emitted by himalayan salt lamps can accelerate blood flow this boost helps to improve several disorders of the vascular system and can prevent certain damage to the lungs purify air 
dust pollen cigarette smoke and other pollutants ruin the purity of the air we breathe and the perfect way to neutralize it is to use himalayan salt lamp on your room it acts as air purifier through its ability to absorb water and evaporating them after they attract water molecules in the air which traps impurities in the air and leaves you with fresh clean air this is known as hygroscopy good vibrations 
salt has been used through out the ages to clean energies from homes and people you can use salt to clear crystals clear your body and clear your home because salt crystals vibrate at a frequency closer to the earths magnetic frequency known as the shuman resonance frequency they can also help bring us back in balance boost energy levels 
positive ions deplete the body of energy and it is believed that himalayan salt lamps can actually do the opposite the negative ions increase energy levels which yields a refreshing effect similar to the feeling of rejuvenation achieved from spending time in nature improve your breathing 
asthma and other breathing complications can be triggered by polluted corrupted air salt lamps ensure that you breathe cleaner air whenever you are around them helping to improve breathing and prevent contaminants from entering your lungs other benefits of using himalayan salt lamp

Old_Logan,national attention on ayotte  hassan nh senate race,"print 
have you ever noticed how washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own 
for the federal government its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar 
you will recall of course how former attorney general eric holder was going to stop police shootings all over america with sensitivity training the power and force of the federal government and investigations investigations and more investigations 
now loretta lynch his successor also known as hillary clintons guardian angel is set to turn police shootings throughout america into big business and more power for washington 
her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians she reported this month 
accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about communitypolice relations lynch said in the days ahead the department of justice will continue to work alongside our local state tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive useful and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve 
the irony here is thick indeed 
one of lynchs goals she says is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them 
meanwhile lynch presides over the most egregious coverup of the most outrageous police shooting case i have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of miriam carey a young black mother with baby in tow who was gunned down by washington cops and secret service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital 
lynch wants reports 
so does wnd which has been pursuing the information through freedom of information act requests and finally after being stonewalled for years a lawsuit 
so does the public and the family of miriam carey unfortunately lynch is holding back on a few things missing evidence the page memo with findings analysis of evidence and conclusions in the carey shooting investigation this would show the evidence and reasoning that led the department of justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have based on the evidence why officers used deadly force whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies video of shooting at capitol police guard post at intersection of constitution ave maryland ave and nd street only stills have been released video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger as doj claimed when he fired fatal shot to careys head not one of the five witnesses at the scene said carey was driving at the officer as the doj claimed police statements the police report said four officers fired shots at carey two from the capitol police and two from the secret service not one statement from those officers was in the report their names were also redacted redacted information an attorney in the washington dc mayors office said the only redactions were names in order to protect privacy it turned out much more was redacted than names the report was riddled with blackedout sections and missing information  pages in the report were entirely blacked out  pages were mostly blacked out  pages were partially blacked out some of the blackedout pages just included a heading marked evidence some just had a date witness statements an astonishing  witness accounts are missing from the police report the police report stated there were seventytwo  witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio andor video recordings copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the usao for review copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the technical support unit tsu located at the iad of those  witness statements only  were in the materials provided to wnd leaving  missing statement transcripts none of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided just paraphrased versions in what the former nypd officer sanders described as cop talk white house guard post video stills were released but not the video it would show whether anyone was manning the post when carey drove up whether she tried to drive around the offduty guard who dragged a gate in front of her and whether she sped off or left at a normal speed as a witness said police radio recordings no recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of carey were provided in the foia material also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters ballistics and forensics reports the justice department washington metro police department responses to foia requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report 
i could go on and on for people who want facts and reports the us justice department under both holder and lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press 
weve been at this for a long time  years yet the stonewall and coverup of a horrendous unjustifiable outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues 
do we really expect eric holder and loretta lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that

also look back to  because it was used in  regardless of how absurd it was to suggest mitt romney was leading a war on womenarticle written by john howard republished from breitbartcom even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity given the emergence of strange new respect for romney this year of course this new respect is pure political opportunism  and dont be surprised to hear liberals complaining in future election that the conservative republican presidential candidate isnt as candid and relaxed about social issues as donald trump was in the good old days of we should practice a little political opportunism of our own and put the lefts revised opinion of romney to good use what they said about him was absurd in almost every respect theyve wholeheartedly embraced his position on the geopolitical threat of russia which means theyre tacitly admitting barack obama didnt know what the hell he was talking about they razz trump about not paying enough taxes but they didnt care a whit that romney paid stupendous amounts of tax plus vast charitable contributionsmost pertinently they turned mitt romney into a misogynist clod and his wife ann romney into an outoftouch stepford wife on the thinnest of pretexts lefty polemicists today are acting like they were possessed by political demons when they spent the final weeks of the  campaign shrieking about binders full of women  and now they cant quite remember what they were going on aboutas for mrs romney she was unceremoniously stripped of her feminine identity by liberals and treated like a space alien because she dared to endorse stayathome motherhood when a mild backlash ensued the white house memorably denied one of its slander ninja by claiming to know several different people with the same name  in the democrat imagination and campaign ads republicans are constantly targeting american woman you can draw a straight line from anita hills hit on clarence thomas in the nineties to journalist george

after george w bush left office he essentially went silent he had no criticism for president obama he didnt sound off about mitt romney or donald trump he went away not so for obama it seems that barack obama will follow the jimmy carter pathway to annoyingland hell be commenting whenever possible after acknowledging that bush could not have been more gracious to me when i came in obama said as an american citizen who cares deeply about our country if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle or go to core questions about our values and ideals and if i think that its necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals ill examine it when it comes 
this comes as welcome news for republicans obamas policy unpopularity  and his tendency to lecture from on high to americans in rural areas  means that hell suck all the oxygen out of the room when it comes to criticizing trump and republicans middle americans voted for trump in order to sound off against obamas obvious scorn for them heres what obama had to say about those who didnt vote for trump in todays der spiegel  
if you look at the new generation of americans they reflect the vision that i spoke about theyre diverse they believe in tolerance theyre accepting of things like samesex marriage they believe in integration the problem though is that young people are less likely to vote than older people what results is a situation in which sometimes the elections dont fully reflect the views of the american population essentially the presidentelect was supported by about  percent of the american population one of our challenges historically is that we have very low voting rates even during presidential elections 
this sort of language drove americans to trump and if obama continues to critique trump from the outside with this sort of language not only will he be doing trump a favor hell be preventing any other democrat from taking a leading role in opposing trump hell become the point of resistance for his own party  and his party wont be able to escape his shadow 
obamas ego has already cost his party the presidency the senate the house a bevy of state legislators and governors mansions now it may cost them the future

on friday the supreme court decided to weigh in on transgender rights in the case of gloucester county school board vs gg  this gives the right wing another chance to take civil rights away from people they dont like plain and simple 
at issue is whether a transgender student who identifies as a boy has a right to use the bathroom that corresponds with the gender he identifies with 
last summer the court granted the school boards request to put a lower court ruling in the students favor on hold until the board filed its petition for review by the supreme court justice breyer joined the conservative justices in that ruling as a courtesy 
the virginia school board established a policy mirroring bathroom police laws in red states like north carolina that required students to use rest rooms and locker rooms to correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth 
in this case the district court ruled against gg by relying on a  regulation allowing schools to provide separate toilet locker room and shower facilities based on sex provided those facilities are comparable to those provided to the opposite sex 
in january  the department of educations office of civil rights issued a letter opining that if schools separate students in restroom and locker rooms based on their sex a school must treat transgender students in a manner consistent with their gender identity 
because of that letter the us court of appeals for the th circuit reversed the lower court ruling in favor of gg it relied on a  supreme court decision that courts generally should defer to an agencys interpretation of its own regulation 
in reality the right wing hopes to achieve two political objectives with this case first this is about denying basic rights and dignity to people who are transgender which is consistent with their ideological opposition to rights for women poc and members of the lgbt community second the right wing is hoping to weaken federal agencies by attacking their ability to interpret their own regulations",politicususa.com,Real,english,100.0,87.98166551253078,78,12,2329,397,4.833753148614609,397.0,0.4904476704060184,0.3616742515005802,-0.171918020799757,-0.1555855777716142,-0.2520241008651582,-0.1476256884241663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.986,0.129,0.049,0.822,Positive,Very Strong

Michael Sebastian,donald trump and his supporters are fighting a rigged system,"via ap  
donald trump was elected americas th president tuesday an astonishing victory for a celebrity businessman and political novice who capitalized on voters economic anxieties took advantage of racial tensions and overcame a string of sexual assault allegations on his way to the white house
his triumph over hillary clinton will end eight years of democratic dominance of the white house and threatens to undo major achievements of president barack obama hes pledged to act quickly to repeal obamas landmark health care law revoke the nuclear agreement with iran and rewrite important trade deals with other countries particularly mexico and canada
the republican blasted through democrats longstanding firewall carrying pennsylvania and wisconsin states that hadnt voted for a gop presidential candidate since the s he needed to win nearly all of the competitive battleground states and he did just that claiming florida ohio north carolina and others
global stock markets and us stock futures plunged deeply reflecting investor alarm over what a trump presidency might mean for the economy and trade
a new york real estate developer who lives in a sparking manhattan highrise trump forged a striking connection with white working class americans who feel left behind in a changing economy and diversifying country he cast immigration both from latin america and the middle east as the root of the problems plaguing many americans and taped into fears of terrorism emanating at home and abroad
trump will take office with congress expected to be fully under republican control gop senate candidates fended off democratic challengers in key states and appeared poised to maintain the majority republicans also maintained their grip on the house
senate control means trump will have great leeway in appointing supreme court justices which could mean a major change to the right that would last for decades
trump upended years of political convention on his way to the white house leveling harshly personal insults on his rivals deeming mexican immigrants rapists and murderers and vowing to temporarily suspend muslim immigration to the us he never released his tax returns breaking with decades of campaign tradition and eschewed the kind of robust data and field efforts that helped obama win two terms in the white house relying instead on his large freewheeling rallies to energize supporters his campaign was frequently in chaos and he cycled through three campaign managers this year
his final campaign manager kellyanne conway touted the teams accomplishments as the final results rolled in writing on twitter that rally crowds matter and we expanded the map
the mood at clintons party grew bleak as the night wore out with some supporters leaving others crying and hugging each other top campaign aides stopped returning calls and texts as clinton and her family hunkered down in a luxury hotel watching the returns
at  am clinton campaign chairman john podesta told the crowd to head home for the night were still counting votes and every vote should count he said
trump will inherit an anxious nation deeply divided by economic and educational opportunities race and culture
exit polls underscored the fractures women nationwide supported clinton by a doubledigit margin while men were significantly more likely to back trump more than half of white voters backed the republican while nearly  in  blacks and twothirds of hispanics voted for the democrat
doug ratliff a yearold businessman from richlands virginia said trumps election would be one of the happiest days of his life
this county has had no hope said ratliff who owns strip malls in the area badly beaten by the collapse of the coal industry you have no idea what it would mean for the people if trump won theyll have hope again things will change i know hes not going to be perfect but hes got a heart and he gives people hope
trump has pledged to usher in a series of sweeping changes to us domestic and foreign policy repealing obamas signature health care law though he has been vague on what he could replace it with building a wall along the usmexico border and suspending immigration from countrys with terrorism ties hes also praised russian president vladimir putin and spoken of building a better relationship with moscow worrying some in his own party who fear hell go easy on putins provocations
the republican partys tortured relationship with its nominee was evident right up to the end former president george w bush and wife laura bush declined to back trump instead selecting none of the above when they voted for president according to spokesman freddy ford
house speaker paul ryan a reluctant trump supporter called the businessman earlier in the evening to congratulate him according to a ryan spokeswoman

in a fit of thundering insanity hillary clinton her media pals and barack obama decided to go to war with the fbi their pretext was that hillary clinton is supposed to have immunity from the fbi before the election and comey was being irresponsible and violating protocol the hatch act and the thou shalt not impede the electoral prospects of democrats mandate 
most americans have the good sense to think that this is a bunch of rubbish  
hillary clinton and president obama are outraged about the fbidirector james comeys decision to disclose further inquiries into her handling of confidential email but are the american people 
shockingly the american people are not all that outraged about the fbi investigating a corrupt criminal not nearly as much as the corrupt criminal and her political allies are 
in an online morning consult poll of approximately  registered voters only  percent agreed with the statement that prosecutors should wait until after election day to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials instead percent agreed that prosecutors should be able to make announcements about investigations concerning political figures or elected officials close to election day even if it might affect the election another  percent said they dont know or had no opinion 
in news thats shocking to the times the american people are once again out of step with their leftwing masters 
when the investigation into mrs clinton was mentioned before the question partisans differed by almost  percentage points in their attitude toward preelection disclosures which were endorsed by  percent of republicans but just  percent of democrats  an even larger gap than observed with the generic prompt by contrast mentioning mr trumps foundation eliminated the gap between the parties in support for publicizing investigations which was backed by  percent of democrats and  percent of republicans

Rafiq,the bnai brith and the history of the mounting assault on academic freedom in canadian universities,"part  introduction  shares
   
for the last  years i have witnessed and experienced the severe restraints on any free and balanced discussion of the facts this reluctance to criticize any policies of the israeli government is because of the extraordinary lobbying efforts of the americanisrael political action committee and the absence of any significant contrary voices
 former us president jimmy carter 
how the interviews came about
the marxian thesis that the dominant culture and ideology of a society here referred to as social base or just base are those of the dominant class here referred to as system is a sharp tool to probe how political systems work and how they stay in power does this tool work in the us model certainly  the relation between the system and its social base has been regular since the inception of the thirteen colonies because of that sustained regularity system and base acted in convergent patterns of dependency in historical perspective it was not possible for the system to transform those colonies into states and thereafter expand its conquests to form a continental empire without a solid social base that shared its purpose and visions for expansion from that time onward an ideological symbiosis ran between the system and the base not only that but each time the system modifies direction philosophy or ideology the base would adapt by modifying its attitudes and perception
the patterns of ideological association between the us system and its social base extended into modern times and the yardstick to measure them is the presidential elections if you look at voters turnout since   you will notice that a relativetolarge majority of americans had voted in those elections my interpretation of the vote in relation to marxs thesis is the following voting for a system that is known for its aggressive imperialist policies crimes around the world overthrowing foreign governments not in line with washington and countless military interventions and invasions that left millions of people dead means one thing voting for that system while knowing its attributes policies and actions amounts to active sharing in its ideology culture and violence
more zionism is racism zionism goes from bad to worse taking judaism with it how modern is israel green party of canada calls to revoke jewish national fund charitable status caveat that does not necessarily mean that all voters share the systems imperialistic values of violence and destruction of foreign peoples the pertinent meaning of voting interpreted in relation to the systems foreign policy objectives versus the objectives of the base resides in two concepts discarding immediately the notion that the base has been cohabitated by the system the first concept has it that the base has given a mandate to the system to carry out its ideology of empire and imperialism based on the undeclared condition to spare the people from the horrors of foreign wars a dichotomy sets in here the system has its way of life and the base has its own the second concept has to do with the basic tenets of colonialism meaning if the system could be successful to obtain unspecified benefits through wars then the base could share in these benefits despite aversion to violence and opposition to the institution of war as a means to resolve problems between nations
 a question would abstaining from voting resolve the issue of active sharing in the policies of the system this subject is open for debate   
the relation between the american system and its base was uniform up to a certain point in history late s until that point the american state was still busy completing its structural transformation into a big power status that uniformity however managed to keep the patterns of the political power unchanged to be exact despite persistent immigration that should have altered the relations between the base and government as well as the composition of the latter the dominance of the traditional ruling elites was  not open for challenge and  shaped by an exclusive american anglosaxon experience
but when franklyn d roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a jewish state in palestine he opened a large crack in the system that was the first time in us history where the powerful american imperialist state yielded to a foreign ideology that was not part of its basic project with that a movement with a limited religious social base began penetrating the files and ranks of the us power the rest is history as a result the unrelenting entrenchment inside the political structures of the united states coupled with accumulated changes in the configuration of the us power the dominant american system itself fell under the domination of one of its social factionsamerican jewish zionists
when franklyn d roosevelt showed signs of surrender to the zionist pressure on the issue of establishing a jewish state in palestine he opened a large crack in the system
as a group american jewish zionists have all attributes of an independent establishment they possess efficient organizational structures have a monolithic political presence across the american system and they know how to finance their activities with us tax money i must note that their alignment with the global agenda of us imperialism is a twopoint expedient the first is focused on being recognized as earnest operators at the service of americas interests the second is tactical to reap on behalf of israel the benefits of alignment with slogans such as israel is our only trusted ally in the middle east
the american jewish zionist experience is agenda driven as such their domestic and foreign agendas have precedence over any other jewishrelated consideration
on the domestic front the focus could not be more evident to consolidate zionism and turn it into a means to  perpetuate israel as an american national issue and  make of them the principal factor in defining american politics you can notice the endeavor clearly during us elections when the zionist media question whether this or that candidate is good for the jews and for israel today voicing dissent against the policies of american jewish zionism or criticizing israel amounts to crime jimmy carter experienced this firsthand when he published his book palestine peace not apartheid  american jewish zionists unleashed the fire of hell upon him
as for the jewish zionist foreign agenda this is clearcut and leaves no space for misunderstanding it aims to induce control or lead the united states to  adopt hostile policies toward the arab nations because due to their rejection of the zionist state and  undertake military actions against any country that appears as posing a potential or direct threat to israel equally important it demands that the united states keep denying the palestinians rights for nationhood through american diplomacy what is the rationale recognition of the palestinian national rights means the invalidation of the zionist state and its claim on palestine
because the jewish zionist control of the us system is real and dominant how does the american society figure visàvis this dominance based on observations of the american society and its multiple cultural and ideological patterns there can be but one answer zionism is not the dominant culture and ideology of the american people it is however the dominant culture and ideology of the us political system
observations
first despite gargantuan zionist propaganda apparatuses directed to the american people jewish zionists have consistently failed to create interest or sympathy for zionist issues and for israel
second due to historically developed indifference to foreign issues a majority of americans have only vague ideas on what zionism is
third to establish roots for their political dominance jewish zionist activists invariably focus not on the american people but on ways to control the american system from inside by controlling first the institutions that matter white house and congress
fourth this control did not happen because of elections it is preponderantly due to the practice of appointing jewish zionists to important positions inside the administrations
fifth among the stratagems employed by zionists when they run for elective offices one was particularly effective take advantage of the reverence of the population for the idea of election to do that jewish zionist candidates rarely if ever talk about israel or zionism instead they only debate matters of interest to the voters once elected though promoting israel via american legislations becomes the top hidden agenda
sixth and to conclude this particular argument the fact that one administration after another succumbed to the diktat of jewish zionists thus indirectly to israel in matters of foreign policy and wars proves that the culture and praxis of those administrations are those of the dominant ideology and culturezionism
another point to discuss is the expansion of the jewish zionist power by all accounts such an expansion is not a phenomenon but an incremental process in his book the arabists the romance of an american elite  robert d kaplan defined the issue that i framed as a process in terms of gradual replacement of traditional diplomatic elites with new ideological elites that had no interest in the ways of the old school of diplomacy kaplan was unambiguous he called these new elites by their names irishamericans and jewishamericans
kaplans viewpoint on this replacement is important to our discussion he argued that the old elites approached the usarab relations with an open mind and readiness for dialog all while keeping an eye on the us imperialist interests his argument opens the door for a veritable conclusion the two groups of postwwii american society that kaplan mentioned had in fact changed the dynamics of us foreign policy it is public knowledge that both groups are known for their hostility toward arabs and muslimseach for his own set of religious political and ideological rationales as for the successive shares of africanamericans and hispanics in the making of the national policy of the united states this is another argument
as a witness to history in early  i began drafting a comprehensive analysis on the role of american jewish zionists in the making of us policies and wars in the arab world in may of that year as my work became broad in scope i decided to seek more views on the subject i came up with the idea to conduct several interviews where i pose the same questions while some of the prospective interviewees declined and others accepted but then withdrew three prominent thinkers acclaimed for their knowledge scholarship and outstanding political activism graciously gave me their views
they are francis boyle a professor of international law university of illinois college of law james petras a professor emeritus university of binghamton new york canadian writer and former coeditor of the online publication of dissident voice kim petersen professors boyle and petras answered my questions via phone conversations and petersen via email correspondence
however in the weeks following the interviews my work swelled up to such a length that it became unsuitable for internet publishing in short i was unable to honor my commitment to publish the interviews as planned today as i thank prof francis boyle prof james petras and kim petersen for sharing their invaluable insight i apologize to them for the delay in putting the interviews out there to read
introduction
the turning point in the emergence of jewish zionism as a dominant american political force came about when iraq invaded kuwait discussing the origins and strategic complications of that invasion goes beyond the scope of this introduction the jewish zionist establishment seized the occasion mobilized its omnipresent propaganda operatives and led colossal media campaigns to promote military actions against iraq to bring their war mania to fruition they unleashed their experts in all directions they talked about iraqs formidable military capabilities and about saddams onemillionman standing army ready to invade saudi arabia and seize its oil they told stories about saddam husseins personal life his bunkers and his mortal nuclear threats to israel and they talked about iraqs threats to us interests and allies in the middle east    here is a brief account of those events
on july   iraqi president saddam hussein met with us ambassador to iraq april glaspie it is on record that glaspie gave hussein an unambiguous but indirect greenlight to resolve iraqs problems with kuwait militarily on august  iraq invaded kuwait on august  george h w bush ordered the freezing of iraqi and kuwaiti assets and immediately placed iraq under hermetic embargo considering the prompt extraordinary antiiraq measures that the united states took in the first  hours of that invasion one wonders what was pushing the us to move so quickly on iraq knowing that only two days earlier this was conducting a us proxy against iran the observation that the us did not take similar actions when iraq invaded iran in  or when israel invaded lebanon in  raises many questions what were the us rationales in taking such measures who conceived them did the us entrap iraq why   
the atmosphere that followed the invasion was surrealistic like a lightning bolt us imperialist and zionist forces instantly mobilized their media talking heads retired generals and bogus experts on the middle east the deafening uproar they made and all lies they told about atrocities committed by iraq in kuwait hid a definite scheme incite for war  in the period august    january   israelis and jewish zionists from all fields appeared en mass and in every possible medium available to urge the bush regime to give up diplomacy in favor of war on january   a member coalition in which the us had the lion shareninetyseven percent of the total forceattacked iraq by every standard and minutia of details the war on iraq in  was an american war 
at the end of a war that destroyed one of israels arab adversaries george h w bush might have thought of himself as americas laureate hero he did not predict though that his temporary freezing of the us loan guaranties to israel would have unleashed the jewish zionist establishment against him the fact that he lost to bill clinton who opposed bushs freeze and who stated that israel was the only country that paid back its debts indicated that american jewish zionists had finally reached their objective to perfect ways to control the us politics from the inside  in retrospect it can be said that george h w bush was the last nonzionist american president from bill clinton forward us presidents and their vice president became pawns in the jewish zionist play of power
now as the united states was preparing for war with iraq to liberate kuwait thousands of antiwar activists and intellectuals from a wide spectrum of political convictions spoke loudly against it but no one could have ever beaten patrick j buchanans memorable words about how american jewish zionists and israel were pushing for that war he said there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the middle east  the israeli defense ministry and its amen corner   with that buchanan hit the proverbial nail on the head am rosenthal a ringleader of us zionist journalism could not bear what he heard in a rebuttal he unleashed an acerbic attack against buchanan his weapon of argument so to speak was the stale and trite accusation of antisemitism
whining rosenthal twisted buchanans clear words and went on to imply that buchanan was in effect engaging in an antijewish tirade he reinterpreted buchanans words and cast them in a standard zionistic fashion he wrote that buchanans intention was the jews are trying to drag us into war only jews want war israeli jews want war to save israels hide american jews who talk of military action against iraq want war because it would suit israeli interests they are willing to spill american blood for israeli interests 
by inserting the word jew in his reply rosenthal and the new york times behind him spat on the face of us political reality under the tight grip of zionism we need not waste our breath on rosenthals petty tactic his clear objective was to distract from the central issue which is buchanans opposition to the planned war against iraq was unrelated to the religious denomination of those who were promoting it rather he was unmistakably referring to their political identity
still buchanan was honest he pointed the finger to israel and its amen corner because that was the truth the fact that most israelis and amen corners happened to be of jewish faith was nonissue to conclude it is evident that buchanan a dreamer of an american republic not empire could not stand by idle while seeing the united states sheepishly fastened to the yoke of zionism and gutlessly prostrating before a tiny settler state israel
buchanan did not stop there truthful and resolute he dared to describe in categorical terms the pitiful condition of the us congress visàvis israel and american jewish zionists he dubbed it as an israelioccupied territory  buchanan powerfully hit the target in such a way that countless cowardly american politicians would dare not think let alone say notice that buchanan had placed israel before its us amen corner i view this as a statement he clearly implied that israel is the primary decision maker did that also imply that us zionist groups amen corner are puppets moved by israel most likely if so which has more power in setting the us world agenda and policies israel or american jewish zionists dialectically the answer should be israel by means of its amen corner
now in december  jim lehrer a former coanchor of the macneillehrer newshour and later sole anchor of the newshour with jim lehrer  interviewed pat buchanan it is important to mention that jim lehrer has monopolized a significant position funded by federal tax money for over  years starting in  is that an issue yes and to debate it the following applies whenever a specific group of people be they christian muslim jewish atheist duopoly party apparatchiks etc keeps an important public post for such a long duration the implication is unescapable the group controls that post because of its embedded importance    but more important they have the power to keep it
nonetheless when a specific group continues to hold throughout time important positions inside public corporations agencies and branches of the us government a paradigm emerges either the group controls said corporations directlythat is why it is able to do what they want or it controls them indirectly by controlling first who appoints the board of trustees and sets corporate policies and appointees at any rate considering this type of control the assumption that such group has power over the government and its public corporations is reasonable
additionally the issue of monopoly of news is critical in another respect it means that someone within the context of us imperialism has decided that the us public discourse must conform to predetermined patterns in these patterns issues such as israel zionism palestine us imperialism in the middle east wars etc are designed to move only on linear grounds without ever touching the core of the matter
before continuing i must state that lehrers political views are not a subject to discuss visàvis his program for one the newshour program is not about the personal views of presentersit is about information prepared for the public from a public corporation second whether lehrer had sympathies for israel or zionism is nonissue because most viewers expect neutral discussions regardless of who delivers them nevertheless a situation such as this has a consequence affecting the special relations between the narrated newscomments the people who deliver them and the people who hear them
firstly planning news delivery to attain specific results is a good technique for those in the business of indoctrination psychology and perception are the areas of expertise that news planners depend on to disseminate certain news and analyses to be sure these planners know that most viewers have no special or personal stakes on events happening in other countries still the immediate consequence that controlled news and commentaries could generate is easy to predict they also know they can seep to the viewers preconceived ideas through pleasant dialogs affable manners appearance of neutrality and clever circumlocutions
to be fair to lehrer he was consistent in making intelligent questions however he was also consistent at doing something else he would calibrate his questions in such a way as not to reveal new truths or solicit critical replies that could go beyond boundaries deliberately conceived so as not to be crossed it is pragmatic to say that the observance of these boundaries would nicely serve the zionist and imperialist discourse in essence a practice thusly followed is a preemptive mechanism of control cloaked as a professional presentation
now in his interview lehrer played dumb when he asked buchanan about his bold characterization of the congress he phrased his question as follows you have also said that congress is an israelioccupied territory now what do you mean by that  italics are mine
comment semantically as much as politically buchanans figure of speech was terse and unequivocal he plainly meant that the congress observes israels agenda and acts accordingly there was no need for buchanan to say anything further because what he said had and still has basis in verifiable facts with a question such as what do you mean by that lehrer was not seeking a rational reply from buchanan the form and content of the question had the objective of wanting to entrap buchanan make him retract or at least contradict himself to show inconsistency in essence lehrer had simply tried to deny that israel controls the congress through its amen corner because his what do you mean indicated astonishment rather than request for explanation 
to wrap up the issue without exclusion any denial of the jewish zionist control of the united states is a farce take abraham h foxman of the infamous antidefamation league as an example foxman authored a masterdeceptive propaganda book that he called  the deadliest lies  the israeli lobby and the myth of jewish control italics are mine first foxman lied he knew very well that the jewish zionist control is not a myth but a pervasive reality second but most important the problem is not the abstract jewish control but the specificjewish zionist control this can be explained using a current universal truth hundreds of thousands of jews from all nationalities actively oppose zionism on political religious ethical historical and ideological grounds
foxmans denial means one of two things either he is a parochial charlatan when the subject is the undisputed power of american jewish zionism or he is very ignorant of the history of zionism  which is impossible either way foxmans business is propaganda demagogy and deception incidentally foxmans denial looks very similar to what some arabs do in the middle east villagersbut even some city folkstry to fend off envy by following an eonold superstition they fix a drawing on a wall in their shops or homes showing the palm of an open hand with an open eye in its center it appears that foxman and his associates have their own superstition by decrying the deadliest lies against american jewish zionists they try to fend off the accusation or the envy that jewsspecifically jewish zionistshave power and influence
of substance did foxman not learn or did anyone inform him about what john foster dulles told william knowland a prozionist senator from california back in february  in an exchange about the proposed sanctions to get israel out of egyptian territory occupied by israel in the suez war dulles pronounced these prophetic words we cannot have all our policies made in jerusalem     that was in  today all those who deride or deny the charge that israel has a say on us foreign policy and wars in the middle east must prove that those who are making this charge are misinformed or just lying
interestingly years after buchanan made that statement the successive events proved his sharp assessment and political perspicacity two people vindicated his characterization of capitol hills as an israelioccupied territory and both used his words to make the point the first is a former cia officer philip giraldi and the second is philip weiss founder of mondoweiss website in an article he wrote in  giraldi pointed to the congress as  its still occupied territory  weiss titled a piece he wrote in  as such  capitol hill  still israelioccupied territory 
at this point do american jewish zionists control the united states do they control it as polity or only the political system do they have real influence in setting us foreign policy and wars against the arab and muslim nations or maybe all this talk is no more than baseless allegations

Daniel Greenfield,media spin the fbis actions are deeply troubling not hillarys,"obamas doj also obstructed clinton foundation investigation october   
we now know that lynch and obamas doj are obstructing the investigation of hillary clintons emails the biased media is predictably spinning this as the fbi being in the wrong and hillarys backers at the doj being in the right 
but it also appears that the doj was obstructing any investigations of hillary including that of the clinton foundation 
the fbi field office in new york had done the most work on the clinton foundation case and received help from the fbi field office in little rock the people familiar with the matter said 
in february fbi officials made a presentation to the justice department according to these people by all accounts the meeting didnt go well 
some said that is because the fbi didnt present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the clinton foundation and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasnt a very strong case others said that from the start the justice department officials were stern icy and dismissive of the case 
that was one of the weirdest meetings ive ever been to one participant told others afterward according to people familiar with the matter 
justice department officials told the fbi at the meeting they wouldnt authorize more aggressive investigative techniques such as subpoenas formal witness interviews or grandjury activity but the fbi officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way these people said 
of course the doj wouldnt authorize investigations of the democratic partys chosen thats the type of elemental corruption at work in the system",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,61,10,1697,275,5.138181818181818,275.0,-0.0293279984263869,-0.0141271790859303,-0.3391273159353301,-0.3468426341593977,0.0484171404795997,-0.3433542597653656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.7616,0.081,0.069,0.849,Positive,Very Strong

amateur footage emerged on saturday showing what appears to be turkish soldiers executing two female pkk insurgents at pointblank range
almasdar news that released the footage says they are not able to independently verify it
a ceasefire between turkey and the pkk ended last year and clashes have since claimed hundreds of lives on both sides
the pkk operates primarily in the mountanious terrain of southeastern turkey and often uploads footage of its kurdish fighters ambushing turkish government troops

figen yuksekdag cochair of peoples democratic party hdp is facing jail time up to  years over comments she made last year in the southeastern border town of suruc the prosecutor of the case requested the ban
hdp described the courts decision to bar yuksekdag from foreign travel as political and arbitrary saying in a statement that it will make a formal appeal for its overturn
the move comes days after the comayors of diyarbakir the largest city in the southeast were detained as part of a security crackdown turkeys largely kurdish southeast has been rocked by violence following the collapse of a ceasefire between the state and the kurdistan workers party pkk last year
president tayyip erdogan has accused the hdp of being a political extension of the outlawed pkk and repeatedly called for the prosecution of its members he has also said the removal of elected officials and civil servants accused of links to the pkk was a vital part of the battle against it
several other hdp lawmakers including cochair selahattin demirtas are also being prosecuted largely over terrorism charges after the parliament earlier this year lifted the immunity of hdp deputies along with the immunity of mps from other parties
meanwhile three turkish soldiers were killed and five others were wounded by mortar fire from pkk militants near the southeastern town of cukurca security sources said
soldiers who were on an operation in cukurca in hakkari province bordering iraq and iraq returned the fire sources said operations were under way to hunt down the militants

Beau Albrecht,how a communist brainwashing method came to the us,"assange claims crazed clinton campaign tried to hack wikileaks the whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from clintons campaign chair rt  october   comments 
julian assange has claimed the hillary clinton campaign has attacked the servers being used by wikileaks 
despite the ecuadorian embassy shutting down his internet until the us election is over the website will continue publishing according to assange 
everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict assange said via telephone at a conference in argentina on wednesday 
the whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from clintons campaign chair john podesta on a daily basis since early october 
assange claimed the release whipped up a crazed hornets nest atmosphere in the hillary clinton campaign leading them to attack wikileaks 
 they attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the un and british courts to accuse me of being both a russian spy and a pedophile he added 
ecuadors decision to shut down his internet was described by assange as a strategic position so that its policy of nonintervention cant be misinterpreted by actors in the us and even domestically in ecuador 
he said he was sympathetic with ecuador insisting they face the dilemma of having the us interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the us elections next month 
assange who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference said he did not agree with ecuadors decision but did understand it wikileaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from ecuador he said 
he did however reject the idea that wikileaks is interfering with the us election claiming this is not the interference of electoral process this is the definition of electoral process  for media organizations and in fact everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring it cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform 
he also attacked us tv networks many of whom he accused of being controlled by clinton supporters 
the podesta emails will make no difference to the election result according to assange i dont think theres any chance of donald trump winning the election even with the amazing material we are publishing because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with hillary clinton he said 
assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view trump as representing what in their mind is white trash newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,59.583710557171294,50,9,2778,454,5.079295154185022,454.0,-0.3656534312002963,-0.2020278943791856,-0.0531253411860349,-0.0662277727379777,-0.009698221831712,-0.0561787329614748,0.0066079295154185,0.0,0.0022026431718061,0,0,0.0,0.0105526772546283,-0.5445,0.061,0.082,0.857,Negative,Strong
Letsbereal,no title,"anyone whos been involved in the manosphere for long enough knows about the concept of a rite of passage for tens of thousands of years when boys hit the age of puberty they were forced to undergo a set of challenges
these challenges were meant to break them down and build them back up even stronger these challenges were meant to test them as men and they are collectively known as an initiation or as a rite of passage when a boy successfully completed the tasks laid before him he became a man
our society for the most part lacks these rites of passage this is in large part why there is such a lack of masculinity in our culture boys are never given a chance to develop into men we have all of these  year old boyishmen running around for a reason there exists no institutionalized rite of passage in the west
despite this however i believe that learning game is a form of initiation it contains all of the traits necessary to turn a boy into a man it teaches boys to develop selfconfidence  despite what women think of them to become decisive and assertive and to remain persistent and cultivate strength of will
death of the ego 
one of the primary functions of a rite of passage is that it destroys a boys ego this is necessary for in order for him to become a man his identification with boyhood must be destroyed in other words he must cease to view himself as a boy and come to view himself as a man
this is in a nutshell what most of the rites of passage were designed to dothis is why many of them simulated death in a rather bellyofthewhaleesque fashion one rite of passage of the aborigines to be specific entailed kidnapping a young boy from his mother
when a boy would reach the age of puberty the men of the village would sneak into his home during the night and kidnap him his mother would put on a big show screaming and fighting to make it seem realistic the men would blindfold the boy and take him to the middle of the woods
he would then spend the next several months undergoing challenges he would not see a single woman for this period of time this sudden yanking from the motherworld of safety and being thrust into the fatherworld of dangerous challenges symbolized his death as a boy
when the boy returned home he would view himself as a man he would carry himself taller he would interact with the women differently and he would have a new sense of purpose in many ways as i will soon explain game does all of these things for the men willing to learn it
facing fears 
many of these challenges that boys were forced to face involved overcoming their fears fear of death fear of the unknown and fear of failure were all overcome during these rites of passage as an example one native american rite of passage involved making a boy sit blindfolded on a tree trunk for three days straight
imagine his fear as he heard the various animals during the night the howling the cawing and the roaring of the animals alone would be enough to terrify even the bravest of men then add in the elements of cold and wind the bugs that must have crawled over his feet and the fear of a rival tribe member killing him and it becomes very apparent how brave the men of the past must have been
then once three days had passed a man of the village would come and remove the boys blindfold this again is symbolic of his rebirth for three days straight he was blind and helpless then his vision returned and he emerged a new man
all throughout the rites of passage of history whether they be of the inuits the amazon tribes or the south african tribes there are some very common characteristics facing your fear being reborn and coping with uncertainty are all critical parts of these initiations
why were these rituals necessary 
upon contemplation it becomes very clear why these rituals were necessary the world that we live in is radically different than the world that our ancestors lived in a tribe of weak men meant extinction there was no military or safety if the men could not protect the tribe it would not be protected
imagine right now if a marauding band of  vandals roamed into your neighborhood they were all extremely jacked mean looking and each one was carrying some sort of weapon a baseball bat a stick or a crowbar do you think that you and your neighbors would have the balls to fight them off
you being a reader of rok may very well fight a noble fightbut your neighbors i seriously doubt that a purplehaired complaining selfcastrating feminist man would be of any use during a battle such as this
now try to imagine that this sort of thing happened fairly regularly for our ancestors it was not uncommon for neighboring tribes to frequently attack you so it was an absolute necessity that the men be trained for battle but being trained for battle requires more than physical strength
it requires ferocity it requires strength of will decisiveness assertiveness and a complete lack of fear these are the characteristics that rites of passage were meant to breed for without them a tribe would go extinct
are these rituals still necessary 
someone might point out that we arent at war anymore so these rituals arent necessary although i agree that we arent in a state of constant warfare anymore i still believe that these rites of passage are extremely necessary heres why
men and women both have distinct psychological makeups there is no denying this no matter how hard the marxists cry and clamor men and women are different boys have an inherent desire to be a part of something greater than themselves namely a tribe boys have an inherent desire to be welcomed into the world of menand we arent getting it because there isnt even a world of men anymore
the once sacred separation of the genders has been desecrated only a select handful of mens organizations still exist the manosphere the freemasons and various other spiritual organizations it used to be commonplace for gentlemans organizations to exist everywhere but theyve become a thing of the past
this is why in large part were experiencing such a crisis of masculinity men dont know who they are anymore we dont have any healthy male role models all weve got is weak men who justify their weakness with feel good aphorisms we want more but we dont get more
any man who is attuned to this can feel it he can feel the general sense of boyishness that the adulthood of men seems to hold onto theres no chance for us to prove ourselves theres no dragons to slay no enemies to fight off and no fears to overcome
and were suffering we can feel it in our bones not only are men unnecessary but we dont even have opportunities to grow and develop like the men of the past we dont have any initiations or male guidance no men to reassure our belonging in the tribe no obstacles to face
learning game the new initiation 
i believe that although it isnt perfect game is a phenomenal substitute for this lack of a male initiation ritual game provides us with many of the characteristics that you need to be a man and it has many of the characteristics that the old rituals of the past did
destroys your ego requires you to face your fears forces you to be decisive in times of uncertainty develops confidence ferocity and a strong will again obviously game isnt perfect one could certainly make the argument that ones masculinity shouldnt be contingent upon what women think and i agree  but do you know what you may get into game for womens approval but any seasoned player knows that you actually stay in the game for your own personal growth
when men first start learning game they get into it because their sex life isnt what they want it to be they think that learning game will get them girls and it does but something happens along the waythey start getting all of the sex that they could ever want and they realize that game has changed them on a deeper level
game provides you with an outlet to overcome your anxiety and to live life fearlessly  by consistently going out and facing your fears of rejection you develop a certain fearless mindset that bleeds into other areas of your life
learning game creates a wholepersonality transformation that cannot be found anywhere else no other hobby outlet or activity will change you as much as game does aside from an actual initiation conducted by the men of the past
game makes you a man 
game will transform you from a boy into a man for a vast number of reasons first off game demolishes your ego  a lot of men have this delusion that they could get any hot girl that they want but they are forced to face reality when they actually go out and try to pull girls
this is why so many men hate game and cant handle it youre forced to face reality very quickly and most men cant take this when you start to go out and learn game you have one of two choices
accept that you suck with girls and keep trying to improve viscerally deny reality and perpetuate your delusions by never going out and experiencing rejection most men choose the latter their ego is far too precious and they cant handle it being challenged those men who do have the courage to demolish their ego however will end up bedding women more gorgeous than they ever imagined take my word for it
second learning game requires you to face your fears think of how many men have approach anxiety nowadays do you think that this underlying anxiety might bleed into other areas of their life of course so once you overcome your approach anxiety in pickup this fearlessness will bleed into other areas of your life in other words youre starting to develop a totally new personality that isnt afraid of living life and taking risks
game forces you to be decisive in times of uncertainty a lot of the time in fact most of the time you dont know whether or not a girls friends will be okay with you you dont know if she has a boyfriend you dont know if she lives nearby you dont know this you dont know that when it comes to game theres a lot of uncertainty
this is why learning game teaches you to accept uncertainty and make take decisive action in the face of it what other skill could be more masculine the men of the past revered this skill because its what their entire livelihood was based around
you see a pack of deer  feet away you dont know if you can kill them or not should you take the risk an enemy tribe is attacking should you run to your hut and get a better weapon or pick up a rock and do what you can youre injured and alone but you see a nearby village should you ask them for help would they kill you or heal you
learning to take decisive action in the face of uncertainty was a skill that every man had for millenia his life depended on it now the only way to cultivate this skill is through game or other more extreme measures such as fighting in a war or something although even then you wont have much freedom to make decisions
all in all game will take you from a boy to a man it will teach you to be confident and to become completely detached from either rejection or acceptance from women it will help you to develop assertiveness and social calibration
most importantly however it will teach you to overcome your fears in the words of my favorite pickup mentor learning game is an odyssey of the mind it teaches you to overcome your fears to face your lingering negative beliefs and to grow as a man our society gives us no right of passage so weve created our own go out and learn game for it will change your life

Jason Easley,doj complaint filed against fbi director james comey for interfering in presidential election,"by sarah jones on tue nov st  at  pm comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the fbi investigated russian interference with the us presidential election and so he told the obama administration not to accuse russia of the dnc hackings lest they be seen as partisan share on twitter print this post 
russia did hack the democrats so all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the us election 
but fbi director james comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the fbi investigated russian interference with the us presidential election and so he told the obama administration not to accuse russia of the dnc hackings lest they be seen as partisan 
republican fbi director james comey advised the obama administration not to publicly accuse russia of hacking the dnc and more on the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the nov  election officials familiar with the deliberations told the washington post 
these sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the post on the condition of anonymity 
there are a few reasons why comey might want to keep his agencys investigation of russian interference under the radar but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be reopening its exhaustive investigation of clintons emails which resulted from a republicanled bogus overreaching and seemingly endless benghazi investigation that also cleared clinton it seems odd that comey was going to stay silent on the russia matter 
comeys decisions is especially odd given the reports that the russians have been communicating and coordinating with republican presidential nominee donald trump to the point that he is already compromised 
only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the united states president 
the same sources tell the post that comey made the decision to reveal the clinton emails to congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation 
not sure im buying that because if comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldnt have said anything at all but that doesnt mean that his motives were nefarious 
there might well be good reason for this  after all this is the fbi and they cant tell us everything but as of right now comey has mishandled this and appears to be trying to influence an election to help republicans just because he is a republican and just because he has donated to republicans doesnt mean he isnt doing his job properly 
but comey has a lot of explaining to do right now he is under fire for good reason as the explanations hes giving for these decisions dont make sense and are contradictory",politicususa.com,Real,english,100.0,92.2978201200483,93,13,2869,483,4.910973084886129,483.0,0.9490732605522584,0.5495749667938356,-0.0290493192598686,-0.0207650298261275,-0.1758155967746572,-0.0096530889541405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9011,0.078,0.049,0.873,Positive,Very Strong

by twain yobra 
posted tuesday november   at pm edt 
joint pain prevents us from exercising or doing simple tasks like walking unfortunately it only gets worse as we age this happens because the fluid synovial fluid in the joints reduces as we age reduction of this fluid increases friction on the joints and leads to arthritis 
but research also shows that uric acid can cause arthritis buildup of uric acid in the joints can damage joint tissues and cause pain the buildup happens when the kidneys dont excrete enough uric acid it can also be triggered by the body converting purines to uric acid fast longterm buildup of uric acid can cause inflammation and reduce your mobility 
switch to an alkaline diet 
theres been a neverending argument about whether alkaline diets reduce acidity in the body or not in fact some experts have discredited them as useless but what does research say well this study found that alkaline diet enhances excretion of uric acid through urine on the other hand researchers found that acidic foods reduce excretion of uric acid 
another study affirms that alkaline diets can help reduce uric acid in the body and they can prevent uric acid crystallization in joints 
note that more research needs to be conducted on effect of diet on uric acid crystal

people think that automated workplace discrimination is still far off in the future when truthfully its right around the corner said stanford computer scientist dr oliver thorpe who spearheaded the new study were already at the point with facial recognition software where it can identify which genders and races should be passed up for leadership roles with far greater accuracy than humans and technologies like this are only getting better and cheaper by the day 
with intelligent algorithms becoming rapidly more sophisticated and capable virtually every industry can soon expect to begin replacing humans with machines that can oppress minorities senior citizens and other subjugated people groups with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy within  years marketavailable computers will have the ability to grossly neglect the needs of disabled workers and make them feel like burdens within  years roving automatons will travel about openplan offices smacking female subordinates buttocks with their carbonfiber paddle attachments adeptly wielding their power in such a way as to avoid consequences 
some believe that machines will never be able to fully replicate the complexity and intuitiveness of human onthejob prejudice but employers will likely be willing to sacrifice that human touch for the sake of their bottom line thorpe notes that maintaining a fuckedup culture of occupational disparity is expensive and as soon as companies realize that they can enlist semiautonomous robots to mistreat their employees at a fraction of the cost theyll be lining up to install them in offices nationwide 
only time will tell whether or not the human workers who have so dutifully carried out discriminatory business practices for decades get laid off or reassigned but one thing is for sure the american office is about to look way different",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,142,22,2896,443,5.514672686230249,443.0,2.4472501883633093,2.240681404433133,-0.0219058841828741,-0.0834722614286795,0.4199767045385428,-0.0738263910332223,0.0022573363431151,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0034087504528071,0.9846,0.129,0.068,0.803,Positive,Very Strong

book review  dr rafiq islam emertec rd ltd dalhousie university halifax nova scotia
 book title true islam jihad and terrorism the science of islamic foreign policy  jaan s islam
 publisher new york nova science publishers
 isbn 
 at a time of politics of fear jaan islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece true islam jihad and terrorism nova science publishers new york  during the  us election it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of islam and how it is understood in todays context this is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about islamic history philosophy and political science this book presents the islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great muslim thinkers and scholars such as ibn khaldun jaan islam uses the socalled islamic cognition technique and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to islamic cognition this chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields such an extension was first pointed by islam zatzman and islam  in their groundbreaking work on educational curriculum
more stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of modern imperialism another ramadan for muslims amid sufferings a conversation on equality integration and islam as a religious marker an open letter to young muslims everywhere the seed of triumph in every adversity following the tradition of early islamic scholars jaan islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary islamic sources quran and authenticated traditions of the prophet  these sources were completely ignored in the in the orientalist now it has morphed into neoorientalism writings which led to the inundation of the post  world with disinformation and agendadriven research about islamic history the distinction between this book and these agendadriven ones gives the book a special value
 although the book explains the islamic foundations of political science and governance it should not be looked at as a book of theology it is a dogmafree approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere  quite appropriately the author starts off with a brilliant narration of islamic cognition it has been all but forgotten in the west that islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogmafree truly scientific cognition the west does recognize averröes the famous islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy whereas brands islam as just another religion similar to christianity infected with doctrinal philosophy it is no surprise that with that starting point islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west
chapter  of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers namely hobbes locke and ibn khaldun in this chapter the author debunks another myth that is ibn khalduns political theory is somehow similar to those of hobbes and locke ibn khaldun the father of social science indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition the author points out how ibn khalduns first premise was shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using quran as the origin and prophet muhammads life through the book of hadith as the pivotal point one the other hand locke had placed himself as the pivotal point whereas hobbes eliminated any cognition point the author makes it clear that both hobbes and lockes cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition in my researched opinion this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic it is because the eastern authors do not know about hobbes and locke and the western authors do not know about islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with ibn khaldun
in chapter  the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs known as rashedun caliphs clearly the authors intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the quran they were enacting for the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the quran no other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in this finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young islamic state of the time
similar to chapter  the author discovers jus ad bello in islamic jurisprudence in chapter  once again the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not the theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter
in chapter  the author addresses a difficult topic when is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state it is often stated that islam is a complete code of life the author makes it clear that islam didnt leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time the important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary this is not an easy topic to cover even in todays world the author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary the history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided caliphate the victors were no longer rightly guided the author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership this chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of islam that has spent lifetime on the topic
often when islamic criteria are discussed eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief if it is all that simple why dont islamic scholars have consensus the author handles this topic like a pro in chapter  he analyzes current islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process he has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the selfrighteous apologist scholars that have done great disservice to islam andor scientific cognition process one doesnt have to be personal but the writing is so clear one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars to anyones surprise this list is not made out of antiislamic nonmuslim scholars
chapter  is where proof of the pudding appears the author analyzes every major event of todays political arena and analyzes it with the islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum the author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups most interesting is the discussion on current us allies such as saudi arabia and how they rank among the biggest offenders of islam and islamic laws this is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable punctuated with numerous riveting arguments
chapter  is the conclusion and recommendation i have studied islam for some  years and yet i found these conclusions novel and entirely logical i doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion it is important to read the book in sequence
chapter  lists the bibliography and references it is many pages long and is quite comprehensive
chapter  is the appendix that lists the letters of the prophet it is a great idea to give the letters in original arabic so there is no room for misinterpretation let alone disinformation
anyone with knowledge of islam knows that jihad is in the core of islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology quite interestingly the author even depicts jihad as the roof of islam without the roof the fort of islam has no protection whatsoever this depiction captures the essence of protection security as well as integrity and puts away the notion of jihad being a weapon for crusade like aggression
this book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about islam or what islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word islam that means peace through submission to the creator this book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in todays world in this sense this book is a manual for world governance in peace",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,4.452858578534739,46,8,8607,1466,4.851296043656207,1466.0,-0.487953588572627,-0.3899286096724409,1.4890629204362047,1.5202651868065868,-0.2347109839022537,1.567405809639293,0.0013642564802182,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0027196746673892,0.9983,0.125,0.067,0.807,Positive,Very Strong
Sean Colarossi,trump proposes canceling election calls black communities ghettos at ohio rally,"here is the full text of sen reids letter to director comey dear director comey 
your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election through your partisan actions you may have broken the law 
the double standard established by your actions is clear 
in my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between donald trump his top advisors and the russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile to the united states which trump praises at every opportunity the public has a right to know this information i wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public there is no danger to american interests from releasing it and yet you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information 
by contrast as soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary clinton you rushed to publicize it in the most negative light possible 
moreover in tarring secretary clinton with thin innuendo you overruled longstanding tradition and the explicit guidance of your own department you rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election despite the fact that for all you know the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated secretary clinton 
as you know a memo authored by deputy attorney general sally yates on march   makes clear that all justice department employees including you are subject to the hatch act the memo defines the political activity prohibited under the hatch act as activity directed towards the success or failure of a political party candidate for partisan political office or partisan political group 
the clear doublestandard established by your actions strongly suggests that your highly selective approach to publicizing information along with your timing was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group 
please keep in mind that i have been a supporter of yours in the past when republicans filibustered your nomination and delayed your confirmation longer than any previous nominee to your position i led the fight to get you confirmed because i believed you to be a principled public servant 
with the deepest regret i now see that i was wrong 
sincerely

reid basically accused comey of violating the hatch act by releasing his letter so close to a presidential election even though harry reid is retiring the bad news for comey is that reids letter is a clear sign that senate democrats arent going to let this matter drop

Robert Spencer,european media jihad against geert wilders,"why time magazines joe klein is so wrong about hillary clinton rebutting the absurd claims of my namesake november   joseph klein 
time magazines joe klein has just penned an article entitled why hillary clinton is the only choice to keep america great i feel duty bound to respond to at least the most absurd of the comments made by namesake and author of primary colors the novel based on about bill clintons first presidential campaign in  
the other joe klein laments that hillary has been so severely damaged in the course of the year battering shes received at the hands of extremists and the media sorry but hillarys wounds are selfinflicted her lies greed and corruption go back decades and have now reached a crescendo with the dual scandals of her use of a private server for state department business while she was secretary of state and of the payforplay clinton foundation 
there is one part of trump that is indisputably real his ego the other joe klein wrote as if hillary were the epitome of humility and grace 
those who would put clintons failings in the same league as trumps depravities are delusional declared klein i agree with his statement but for precisely the opposite reason that he advances trump did not abuse a public office for personal gain he did not hand pick hillarys word an ambassador to serve in one of the most dangerous countries in the world and then never respond to his multiple requests for enhanced security let alone pick up the phone and contact ambassador chris stevens directly the government was not able to save four lives to keep four lives safe how can you keep a country safe asked stevens former fiancé in a rhetorical question that hillary would be unable to answer trump did not lie to the families of those slain in benghazi as hillary did trump did not put national security at risk by using a private server for government emails in order to evade the freedom of information act as hillary did 
in short anyone who thinks that hillarys proven record of recklessness mendacity and indifference is not more troubling by several orders of magnitude than trumps depravities is delusional 
the other joe klein complains that trump deals in stereotypes  the blacks the hispanics the muslims the women and yes even the veterans yet much of hillarys pitch is genderbased elect her because she is a woman and she attacks millions of people who support her opponent with vile epithets  deplorable racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamaphobic and  for good measure  irredeemable 
the other joe klein charges that trump is about all that has gone wrong in our society and nothing of what has gone right to paraphrase bill clinton that would depend on what your definitions of wrong and right are is hillary clinton really right when she parrots black lives matters stereotypical attacks on what she herself has characterized as white privilege and systemic racism in this country is she right when she leaps to conclusions about police brutality aimed against africanamericans before the evidence in specific cases is carefully examined i dont think so 
hillary also represents the political correctness and antireligious bigotry of the secular left elite that many americans believe are what truly have gone wrong in our society at the women in the world summit last year for example hillary said that in order to fully secure the reproductive rights of women deepseated cultural codes religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed hillary demeaned the sincerely held religious belief in the sanctity of life held by millions of americans reminiscent of president obamas contemptuous clinging to religion quote back in  
hillarys key supporters and top aides have targeted the catholic church in particular for their notion of progressive reform there needs to be a catholic spring in which catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the catholic church wrote sandy newman president of voices for progress in an email to clintons campaign chairman john podesta in response podesta picked up on the spring theme he wrote we created catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a moment like this but i think it lacks the leadership to do so now likewise catholics united like most spring movements i think this one will have to be bottom up 
when time magazines joe klein talks about what is right or wrong in american society he should get out of his washington dc bubble more often and actually speak with the american people about their daytoday concerns even if hillary clinton ends up winning the election the country will remain divided and she will have no mandate whatsoever to advance her progressive agenda",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,85.16960871803,42,6,4792,807,4.916976456009913,807.0,-0.6102537459449576,-0.7657300402589515,0.479722001223845,0.4871635461545432,-0.1698908582300012,0.5101506578864214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.6114,0.116,0.116,0.767,Negative,Strong

im all for a recount because it could do exactly what james suggests puts the whole thing in chaos and this is exactly what i said here before the election i was furious when al gore simply gave up in  when he should have fought on to the bitter end and if there really are irregularities which would put this election in question the people need to know that even if it doesnt actually change anything chaos is a very revealing state and anything that elevates awareness of the farce that is our two faces of a single coin political system is good 
of course if one believes the election was totally rigged start to finish then no doubt they would believe that this is just another act in the play already written so probably would downplay it entirely so ironically the people who most believe the election was rigged are the ones who care least about that being explored because that exploration is just as false as the election of course thats an unfortunate position i think and in this case may just go to serve the purposes of the criminal elite thats the trap in that sort of absolutist structuralist thinking

# 1 NWO Hatr,cop crashes car and runs away when more cops arrive,"new york post  by michael gartland 
the de blasio administration is trying to limit the number of food trucks in the city by claiming that each hotdog and kabob cart causes more pollution than a truck ride to los angeles 
deputy health commissioner corinne schiff made the claim at a city council hearing wednesday in an apparent effort to sink a bill that would nearly double the number of foodvendor permits in the city by  
meat grilling is a significant source of air pollution in the city schiff said one additional vendor grilling meat emits an amount of particle pollution in one day equivalent to what a diesel truck emits driving  miles 
the new bill would boost the number of permits to  by  and also create an enforcement team to sniff out violations 
since  the number of streetfood vending permits has remained steady at  but there are likely more carts than that on the streets as some vendors simply open shop without a license and work until they are caught 
schiff argued any increase in the number of food carts needs to come with regulations stipulating that the carts operate in a more environmentally friendly manner 
city councilman mark levine dmanhattan who is sponsoring the bill to increase the permits wondered if this was already the case we have laws in the city about air quality that currently stipulate that any food establishment has got to have a hood over a grill levine said is that not currently the law 
schiff however said there are no such laws regulating the carts as she suggested the proposals be delayed to ensure better pollution safeguards 
we really see this as an opportunity to work with the council to think through how we might use this modernization act to improve air quality she said the current laws dont actually control the emissions that were concerned about 
businessimprovement districts and residents throughout the city also pushed for delays on increasing vendor permits saying there are too many already in some neighborhoods but welcomed increased enforcement 
the enforcement idea is a great idea said ellen baer cochair of the nyc bid association lets see if this works lets see how it works lets see if its sufficiently funded lets see how many resources they need  before we start adding to the chaos 
but street vendors argued theyve waited too long for reforms that would allow them to transition from operating illegally to legally 
sean basinski director of the street vendor project described the bills as far from our dream but said he supports most of what they call for 
it is a reasonable compromise he said vendors have been waiting  years for this change    we certainly welcome a study being done but we dont think that should delay the progress that needs to be made the time for reform is now 
before the hearing some vendors rallied outside demanding that city officials and police stop harassing them and treating them like criminals 
the bill will remain before the committee while members discuss possible changes",fromthetrenchesworldreport.com,Fake,english,17.49798608325944,4.452858578534739,51,10,3000,509,4.840864440078586,509.0,-0.3350783918572136,-0.0141271790859303,0.0056095694470302,0.0199946707155311,-0.2450059535992029,0.0320595573972625,0.0019646365422396,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0048663391194481,0.9845,0.131,0.065,0.805,Positive,Very Strong

i have looked to our northern neighbour as one admires a wiser older sibling canadians to me seem less radical less extreme and more ethical than my own more reactive countrymen and women canada after all accepted our draft dodgers of the s who questioned the morality and justness of the vietnam war to me that was something to be lauded imagine my chagrin upon learning that a university professor with a year career who encourages critical analysis and social responsibility had been suspended without pay apparently without a formal and unprejudiced investigation occurring first
halls suspension reminds me of the famous cases of two american academics steven salaita and norman finkelstein both were openly critical of zionism and spoke against the marginalization and persecution of the indigenous arab populations of the occupied territories both were ostracized publicly for their vocal support of palestinian rights and lost their jobs
i adjure the not to take a page out of the american playbook by punishing academics who dare to speak up for the marginalized peoples of the world please live up to the values of the wiser more ethical and socially conscientious northern neighbour you have always represented for americans like myself

August Moliere,the only strategy that could have stopped donald trump,"every man who supports donald trump came to it from a different path some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants  or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect for me and many other men we came to support trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women 
the fight began in  with the southern poverty law center 
in march  after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites  i was put on a list by the jewishoperated southern poverty law center for being a misogynist  i was shaken up by this because i knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths ive learned from it put me on a path of no return either i close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door
i decided to keep going i responded to the splc designation with an article titled my existence is becoming illegal  where i described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it
it is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street men can hate women but not the other way around men can rape women cant men can be abusive both physically and emotionally but women cant men can be misogynist but women cant be misandrist a word that is unknown to most of the american population men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist if youre a man youre likely a perpetrator of hate violence and abuse to innocent american women even if you dont yet realize your thought crime but never the other way around
fast forward two years to october  witch hunts by leftists were in force rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists homophobes and sexists with the aim of getting them fired i studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles ive ever published what is a social justice warrior sjw 
the article was widely shared influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia the corporate news media hollywood fortune  companies silicon valley and the billionaire owners of our politicians scratch a feminist sjw and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes
i was pessimistic when i wrote the sjw article thinking wed need a full generation  years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiamerican entity  i focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them little did i know that i was defining them at their absolute peak and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency the social justice warriors havent gone away and they are rushing to fulfill the will of george soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced along with the power of the institutions that support them
though sjwism peaked in  i had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of  during the canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in february  during the international meetups  i survived those attacks and the fact that im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us they bruised me during the meetup outrage but i healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs donald trump
donald trump ground zero 
im a pessimist by nature so i didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow trump to win in the primaries even though i was confident his ideas resonated with most americans but then i noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out no matter what his enemies did i saw him humiliate jeb bush  outcompete a resurgent ted cruz and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness by the time i attended the republican national convention in cleveland  i started to believe
the ground zero for donald trump within the manosphere was the donald trump thread on the forum created in june  by veteran member and rok contributor samseau  this is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men over  pages long the thread has been viewed nearly  million times ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse as described here  to men with bullhorns larger than i have
after significant battles in a real war medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier they all worked as a team to ensure victory from the general donald trump the colonels his advisers the captains major media influencers like alex jones matt drudge paul joseph watson and mike cernovich the sergeants men like myself the specialists men like samseau and on down to the private a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time
the ego cares about how impactful one is how influential its ideas are but the team player only cares about victory for the whole whether i am a private or a sergeant i fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election but on the lives of so many men who participated in it
approaching the date of the election 
two months before the election i did a youtube video urging men to vote for trump  and it resulted in nearly  unsubscribes within a day surprising even me since i thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a trump presidency the video echoed a lot of sentiments i shared in the article if donald trump doesnt win were screwed  where i tried to convey the danger of a hillary presidency
obama was the race president and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years hillary will be the gender president the future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat trump
not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again this isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like twitter or youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment
for the next month i stared at the calendar waiting for the election to happen doing what i could to push back against the narrative on twitter  then in early october an old tape was released of trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him my sister called me confused and asked if he really was a bad man i told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate  i told her not to believe the media and to judge trump by his actions and his policies not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help hillarys failing campaign
i spoke to her with confidence but inside i was concerned in a politically correct world would this be the blow to sink trumps candidacy is the majority of americans actually ready to defeat political correctness thankfully trump responded strongly ignoring calls by the traitors in the republican party to step down
the first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that trumps support didnt decline the fake controversy didnt work i held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out maybe of him saying the nword but none did and i knew the establishment had no more bullets this was the moment where i finally believed i felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that trump was going to win i did a periscope that night as if i was amped up on methamphetamine but i took no drug

from that point on it was just a matter of hanging on until finally on november  when he was elected president i was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when i was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against trump i didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom i consider on the same team as us if i made any miscalculation it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces i underestimated our own power and those of our allies in the alternative internet space
human control is a foolhardy endeavor 
the most important lesson i learned from trumps victory is how pointless it is to control human beings both their behaviors and their minds every single major institution in the united states represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence could not stop a populist candidate in spite of trying everything short of assassination
george soros and his billions werent effective obama and his allies werent effective the mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective ceos of the biggest companies in the united states werent effective hollywood and its superstars werent effective academia and its thousands of professors werent effective social media and its censorship efforts werent effective the fbi allowing hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective even donald trumps own party wasnt effective in stopping him its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers what a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably
think right now of how much effort the antitrump forces put into stopping him from winning think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome and now think how it was all for nothing  they accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the american public
whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature god tao or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it imagine how impotent george soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing

now they have to perfect their control methods even more open their pocket books further and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody that they are powerful that the world must be shaped into their image that they are gods among men but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled
you can control human beings but only temporarily and only some of them at the end of the day humans want to do what they want to do and if you dont possess what they wish to buy they will go to someone who does no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control the more you control what does not want to be controlled the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling of which we are currently living through in previous eras that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets but in our modern era it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes
if you want to be a true leader of society create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want can freely engage in commerce can create families can live in safety can search for the truth without interference and can work and play and live according to their nature put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down it may take a decade it may take  years but it will happen and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness
conclusion we are tired of being controlled leave us alone we are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us of forcing us to believe in falsehoods of programming us to hate our country of pitting woman against man and black against white leave us alone let men be men and from that a new american renaissance will come forth men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives and if you prevent us from doing so we wont allow you to live yours we will humiliate your useful idiots we will destroy your institutions we will lash out with more than just memes
im afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us but at least now we have our man in the white house who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years i cant wait to see where this fight takes us next

the complaints noted that the machines wrongly identified a voters choice but in all reported cases the voters were able to correct their ballots before casting them 
to my knowledge at this point we dont have any cases where elections officials noted significant problems with any machines based on these complaints of course theyre all looked into and thats why we encourage people to immediately flag down an election official commented gannon 
the nc state board of election released the following statement regarding the complaints 
the nc state board of elections is aware that some voters have contacted advocacy groups or elections officials with concerns about touchscreen voting machines in several counties 
similar reports have been made in recent elections and we take them very seriously 
we want to ensure voters that safeguards are in place to ensure touchscreen machines accurately record voters selections 
touchscreen machines are tested thoroughly before each election they are recalibrated daily before voting begins to test and ensure accuracy if a voter notices an issue with selection accuracy of a machine they should raise their hand and notify an election official immediately if needed the machine may be taken out of service for recalibration and the voter may be moved to a different machine 
also each touchscreen machine prompts voters to review their selections before casting their ballot as with paper ballots voters should check over their selections to ensure accuracy prior to casting their ballot on touchscreen machines voters also can review a realtime audit log that records all of their selections 
we urge all voters to carefully review their selections before casting their ballots and to immediately report any questions or concerns to elections officials said kim westbrook strach executive director of the nc state board of elections",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,78,12,1901,296,5.39527027027027,296.0,0.4904476704060184,0.3616742515005802,-0.2851546953535945,-0.313921337568058,0.3021382298588139,-0.3096632761738477,0.0101351351351351,0.0,0.0101351351351351,0,0,0.0,0.0179469179636569,0.9456,0.097,0.047,0.857,Positive,Very Strong

empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that god forbid we put someone like that in the white house he added of clintonkallstrom also said that fbi director james comey and the rest of the fbis leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation not the rest of the bureauthe agents are furious with whats going on i know that for a fact he said corrupt proclinton journalists should not be given any quarter in all this much like the propagandists of the third reich they abuse their positions of power to operate in conspiracy with an outright criminal who acts against the interests of the american people did you know that hillary clinton sold off uranium mining rights to the russians because the oligarchs who made billions off the deal turned around and donated millions to her clinton foundation if you arent aware of this you need to watch clinton cash immediately  the simple truth is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel what america has now come to realize via the wikileaks email dumps  the project veritas undercover videos and even the revelations of former fbi agents who know whats really happening inside the agency is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel from the dnc which actively conspired to sideline bernie sanders during the nomination process to the leftwing media which coordinates false smear attacks against donald trump every element of the democrat party is hopelessly corrupt democrat political operatives abide by no laws no ethics and no boundaries they lie cheat and steal their way into power at every election and theyre desperately trying to steal this election tooits not just that the clinton crime family must be taken down you see its that the entire democrat establishment should be disbanded or imprisoned  there isnt a highlevel operative inside the dnc who isnt committing election fraud on a daily basis the coordination and collusion money laundering and paytoplay influence for sale schemes are all illegal yet they are the very foundation of the democrat establishment as it exists todayevery one of these people needs to be arrested indicted and imprisoned this is the only way genuine democracy can be restored across america aside from their criminality democrats policy ideas just dont work even on policy alone democrats are total failures  none of their ideas or policies actually work look at obamacare with its insurance costs now doubling every  years  with coverage options crashing nationwide and the entire failed idea now on the verge of imploding this was hailed as an historic solution by obama and the rest of the dummocrats who forced it through congress and the supreme court in reality obamacare was the dumbest idea ever

big ideas that routinely fail they confiscate money from taxpayers waste it on the most stupid policy ideas ever dreamed up while siphoning off billions for their own salaries bonuses and luxurious lifestyles then if you oppose their complete idiocy they invoke the irs to have you audited or arrested this is amerika today under obama and the clintonsthis racket must end the clintons and all

Alex Ansary,bundy brothers discharged from oregon jail headed to nevada with us marshals,"us militia girds for trouble as presidential election nears  
reuters 
down a georgia country road camouflaged members of the three percent security force have mobilized for rifle practice handtohand combat training  and an impromptu campaign rally for republican presidential candidate donald trump 
how many people are voting for trump oohrah asks chris hill a paralegal who goes by the code name bloodagent 
oohrah shout a dozen militia members in response as morning sunlight sifted through the trees last weekend 
as the most divisive presidential election in recent memory nears its conclusion some armed militia groups are preparing for the possibility of a stolen election on nov  and civil unrest in the days following a victory by democrat hillary clinton 
they say they wont fire the first shot but theyre not planning to leave their guns at home either 
trumps populist campaign has energized militia members like hill who admire the republican moguls promise to deport illegal immigrants stop muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the mexico border trump has repeatedly warned that the election may be rigged and has said he may not respect the results if he does not win at least one paramilitary group the oath keepers has called on members to monitor voting sites for signs of fraud 
armed paramilitary groups first gained prominence in the early s fueled by confrontations in ruby ridge idaho and waco texas culminating in a militia sympathizers  bombing of a federal office building in oklahoma city that killed  people 
their numbers dwindled following that attack but have spiked in recent years driven by fears that president barack obama will threaten gun ownership and erode the power of local government the southern poverty law center which tracks extremist groups estimates there were  active militias last year up from  in  
in recent years armed groups have confronted federal authorities in a series of landuse disputes in the western united states federal officials fear more clashes could come after seven militants were acquitted on conspiracy charges for occupying a federal wildlife refuge in oregon 
many fear clinton would push the county further to the left 
this is the last chance to save america from ruin hill said im surprised i was able to survive or suffer through eight years of obama without literally going insane but hillary is going to be more of the same 

extremist groups emboldened 
the oath keepers a prominent antigovernment force that sent guntoting members to the  race riots in ferguson missouri called on members last week to monitor voting sites on election day for any signs of fraud 
an hour south of atlanta the three percent security force started the day around the campfire taking turns shooting automatic pistols and rifles at a makeshift target range they whooped with approval when blasts from one members highpowered rifle knocked down a tree 
the group operates independently but is affiliated with a national armed movement that calls for members to defend individual rights in the face of what they see as an overreaching federal government the movement draws its name from the notion that no more than  percent of the american population fought in the revolutionary war against britain 
amid the war games hill weighed plans for a possible armed march on washington if clinton wins 
he said he doesnt want his members leading the way but they will defend the protesters if need be his group will not hesitate to act if a president clinton tries to disarm gun owners he said 
i will be there to render assistance to my fellow countrymen and prevent them from being disarmed and i will fight and i will kill and i may die in the process said hill who founded the militia several years ago 
trumps candidacy has emboldened extremist groups to speak more openly about challenging the rule of law said ryan lenz a researcher at the southern poverty law center 
prior to this campaign season these ideas were relegated to sort of the political fringe of the american political landscape he said now these ideas are legitimized 
over the past week some prominent trump supporters have hinted at violence 
if trump loses im grabbing my musket former illinois representative joe walsh wrote on twitter last week conservative commentator wayne root fantasized about clintons death while speaking at a trump rally in las vegas on sunday 
back in georgia the three percent security force wrapped up rifle practice in the midday sun they then headed further into the trees to tackle an obstacle course with loaded pistols at their sides ready for whatever may come

the new data was reportedly uncovered during a separate investigation into anthony weiner  the husband of clinton ally huma abedin 
fbi director james comey cited recent developments for the bureaus decision in a letter to committees and lawmakers today

Daniel Greenfield,obamas un ambassador cuba is right about our human rights,"obamas attorney general warned fbi director not to inform congress of new hillary investigation   
the media is shamelessly spinning this corrupt behavior by attorney general lynch as standard protocol and blasting the fbi from deviating from some imaginary standard in which democratic presidential candidates are supposed to be immune from the consequences of their criminality  and congress is meant to be kept in the dark 
attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates disagreed with fbi director james comeys decision to notify congress about his bureaus review of emails potentially related to hillary clintons personal server law enforcement officials familiar with the discussion said 
there was no direct confrontation between lynch or yates and comey instead the disagreements were conveyed to comey by justice department staff who advised the fbi chief his letter would be against department policy to not comment on investigations close to an election the officials said 
it is in line with policy though for lynch to have met with bill clinton 
but yes a hillary backer disagreed with a course of action damaging to her candidate 
comeydecided to disregard their concerns and sent the letter friday anyway shaking the presidential race  days before the election and nearly four months after the fbi chief said he wouldnt recommend criminal charges over the democratic nominees use of the server 
the officials acknowledged there was little lynch and yates could do given the fallout over lynchs controversial meeting over the summer with former president bill clinton

No Author,trump warns of world war iii if clinton is elected,"email 
donald trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the november election will be rigged against him 
of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day trump tweeted monday morning why do republican leaders deny what is going on so naive 
its a charge that even other republicans have been quick to refute critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the us democratic process 
states backed by tens of thousands of gop and dem volunteers ensure integrity of electoral process sen jeff flake of arizona who is often sharply critical of trump tweeted sunday elections are not rigged 
jon husted the secretary of state of ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state also said monday that he could assure trump the election would not be rigged 
trumps most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls before now trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early august 
and im telling you november  wed better be careful because that election is going to be rigged the new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity in august and i hope the republicans are watching closely or its going to be taken away from us 
multiple republicans told business insider at the time that trumps assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous as trump would be the first us presidential candidate in modern times possibly ever to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election 
allen raymond a former gop operative who was involved in the  new hampshire senate election phonejamming scandal called trumps continued insistence that the election would be rigged detrimental to the republic 
the idea that its rigged i dont know what hes talking about he said in august i know someone that rigged elections i mean you know the fact of the matter is hillary clinton doesnt need to rig this election trumps going to win alabama and thats it she doesnt have to do anything its painful to watch 
raymond wrote how to rig an election confessions of a republican operative as a tellall about the attempt to rig the  new hampshire senate election between thengov jeanne shaheen a democrat and republican us rep john e sununu raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the new hampshire democrats office in manchester  a task his phone bank was hired to carry out sununu went on to win the election by roughly  votes shaheen defeated sununu in a rematch in  
the operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvementhe said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that  not what trumps talking about 
the manhattan billionaire told the washington post in august that a lack of voteridentification laws would let people just keep voting and voting and voting and suggested fraud occurred in  against republican nominee mitt romney because there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the republican 
i dont even know what hes talking about raymond said but this idea that its  or  and the party bosses are going to roll into pittsburgh and philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines  thats nonsense an election rigging these days means something totally different than what hes talking about now its stupid stuff like what i did in new hampshire 
he said the lack of voterid laws trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus 
these voterid laws whats the intention of that the clear intention is disenfranchisement he said echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voterid laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots you know theres a reason we dont have a poll tax anymore because its unconstitutional 
people dont vote  times he continued there might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times but hes talking about an institutional effort its a total myth 
he said trumps statements were an attempt to basically sideline hillary clintons first four years in office 
the idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the democratic national committee had its emails hacked and leaked though both trump and sen bernie sanders of vermont clintons main opponent in the democratic primary had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season the emails showed that the organization which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary favored clinton 
trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was rigged against sanders in his earlyaugust interview with hannity in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail he used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,50,10,4834,824,4.828883495145631,824.0,-0.3656534312002963,-0.0141271790859303,0.4908340113436141,0.5138141195856278,-0.2568299712689491,0.5374243112700312,0.0036407766990291,0.0,0.0012135922330097,0,1,0.0,0.006987628197581,-0.9946,0.054,0.114,0.831,Negative,Very Strong

i live in america and i am happily married with kids i do not write this because i am more manly or intelligent or successful than you i am not i write this to share the main key to my success patriarchal traditional religion 
i am writing from my own religious convictions which i believe are true you are free to disagree but you may still find value here i have read the writings of other religions and consider them true myths useful for their wisdom even though i may disagree with their theology neomasculinity itself is a philosophy that can be accepted by people of different religions or no religion modern religion ill find another church thanks 
modern religion is a feminized wasteland god exists to impose obligations on men and excuses womens evil acts faith is blind irrational and collectivist 
men hate modern religion which is why most churches in the west are demographically imbalanced toward women men are bored to death with touchyfeely sermons endless committee meetings female gossip and the losers sitting in the pews around them this is not how it should be patriarchal religion thats more like it 
patriarchal religion is interesting to men it teaches that god is a man creator of rationality slayer of evil men protector of the innocent praise be to the lord my rock who trains my hands for war my fingers for battle psalm  
in maleled churches women are taught to be respectful to their fathers husbands and legitimate authority they understand that their role is to raise and care for children and support their husbands mission wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the lord ephesians  
in patriarchal religion female sins like rebellion envy dishonesty hypergamy dressing and acting like a whore and hamstering or rationalizing sin are condemned when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom she took some and ate it genesis  i also want the women to dress modestly with decency and propriety adorning themselves not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes but with good deeds appropriate for women who profess to worship god  timothy  and adam was not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner  timothy  this is the way of an adulterous woman she eats and wipes her mouth and says ive done nothing wrong proverbs  finding a virtuous woman this is the unicorn i married 
all women are tempted towards sins like envy but not all women act on their impulses in spite of what many observe in the west i have met many virtuous women few sexual partners before marriage respectful submissive to their husbands physically fit feminine good mothers most are in the older generations especially before the boomers most are involved in traditional religion there are fewer younger women who are virtuous and every single one that i have met is involved in traditional religion they tend to be more rural from small churches 
traditional religion can be extremely helpful to finding and vetting women it provides a community with certain values that you want in a woman and it provides reliable references for a persons character a woman who spent her younger years out in the world and came back at  be a bornagainvirgin is a red flag but a woman in her early s who teaches sunday school and helps with the potluck dinners is far more likely to be wife material the older women in the church will usually let you know if a woman is a whore patriarchal religion helps control womens sinful tendencies with proper training woman can be virtuous 
traditional religion acts as a curb but not a cure for womens immoral rebellious destructive behavior my wife goes to a womens bible study group where she often receives instruction from older religious women this includes things like telling her to be submissive to me lose weight and be healthy not waste money have cheerful sex on a regular basis and to learn how to get some control over her emotions teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine but to teach what is good then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children to be selfcontrolled and pure to be busy at home to be kind and to be subject to their husbands titus  
one of my wifes friends once corrected her attitude toward sex saying you need to view your body as a sheath for your husbands sword she now routinely thanks me after we have sex i am not a natural alpha but i have little fear that my wife is going to suddenly cut off sex if i have a minor slip up band of brothers weve got your back bro deus vult 
with this great power comes great responsibility as a patriarch i am commanded to lead my family instructing my wife and kids on how to act properly with genuine love for their wellbeing i must be on top of my game be physically fit and think rationally when my wife is irrational i attend a mens bible study where we talk about leading as men every man in my group owns a gun and we often go shooting together 
we encourage support teach and correct each other i have had sharp intense discussions with my pastor and men in my church about my own character and life decisions things are handled like men discussed in the open with realtalk not rhetorical bullshit and masculine love and concern for each other this has aided me in thinking deeply about my life and correcting bad decisions i have made 
awhile back we helped another man who was on the verge of divorce he was working  hours a week because he would not stand up to his employer and had no energy to lead his family we told him that the marriage counseling he was getting was bullshit talk about your feelings more and that his slavish attitude toward his employer was making his wife lose respect for him the women in our church also talked to his wife about choosing to be respectful and submissive in spite of her rebellious emotions 
he cut back hours at work which enabled him able to be captain of his ship again this along with training his wife received helped her become more respectful now his wife is less of a bitch and they have sex several times a week i doubt this would have happened without patriarchal religion children ive succeeded as a father 
we see that our culture is toxic feminized and immoral men need a place to raise children apart from these toxins and church is a great place to do this my kids go to sunday school classes where they are taught to be respectful to me my wife and legitimate adult authorities we have several families with welldisciplined children that we can trust wont corrupt our kids my wife often takes the kids for playdates so she can socialize with wholesome women which is a great alternative to sitting around on social media all day conclusion patriarchal traditional religion will not change female nature but it can help restrain it this is how past generations maintained civilization i can confidently say that traditional religion is the main reason i can maintain a happy marriage in this cesspool of a culture those who are not religious might consider other institutions that may provide similar support for their marriage and childraising",prisonplanet.com,Fake,english,20.8,8.476806513105332,8,2,7720,1359,4.659308314937454,1359.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,1.2543878495734622,1.3525233422697605,-0.4241840437859536,1.3957422265777493,0.0007358351729212,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0011111673661468,0.9993,0.197,0.109,0.693,Positive,Very Strong

EdJenner,from higher ed to political indoctrination,"go to article 
the obama department of justice has been corruptly aiding and abetting the democratic partys presidential nominee hillary clinton to escape legal accountability for her actions from attorney general loretta lynch on down through the justice departments political ranks the department has blocked the fbi from searching for the truth and following the evidence of potential criminality to its logical conclusion whether it is hillarys use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state or her involvement in the payforplay clinton enterprise known as the clinton foundation the obama administration is applying a banana republicstyle double standard to pervert justice and the rule of law in order to shield her 
lynch and president obama were reportedly furious with fbi director james comey for sending a letter to congress on october  th indicating that new evidence potentially pertinent to the email case had come to light which required further investigation this evidence consisted of a batch of emails fbi investigators had found on one or more computers belonging to anthony weiner clinton confidante huma abedins estranged husband while they were searching for evidence in an unrelated case involving weiners alleged sexting to an underage girl comey sent his letter after months of agonizing over his previous decision to let hillary off the hook in the email case last july he was said by a source close to him to have been particularly disturbed by the mounting number of resignation letters from fbi agents who felt betrayed by that decision 
department of justice officials had leaned on comey not to send the letter to congress claiming that it would violate department protocols and procedures against taking any action that could be perceived as interfering with the upcoming presidential election to his credit comey ignored the department officials objections claiming he had an obligation to keep the congress and the public informed of any potentially significant new developments in the case 
democrats who had lavished praise on comey for his july decision lashed out at comey for sending his letter updating congress senate minority leader harry reid went so far as to make the baseless charge that comey may have violated the law by informing congress because reid argued he appeared to be taking sides in an election the disgraced former attorney general eric holder held in contempt of congress for withholding information relating to the fast and furious scandal said about comeys action i fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the justice department and the fbi it is up to the director to correct his mistake  not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the american people 
since when has holder been genuinely concerned about protecting our system of justice and best serving the american people holder had already contributed to the erosion of public trust with his blatant politicization of the obama department of justice as evidenced by the obama department of justices handling of the multiple fbi investigations involving hillary clinton the department has continued its slide into the muck of corruption it interfered with both the normal course of criminal investigations and the election by stacking the deck in hillarys favor ensuring that no indictment would occur to derail her path to succeed obama and preserve his legacy 
first the department of justice reportedly refused to empanel a grand jury in either the email case or in connection with the fbis investigation of the clinton foundation payforplay allegations the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation former assistant fbi director james kallstrom said  thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that 
kallstroms belief that lynch acted to influence the results of the fbi probes in hillarys favor is buttressed by lynchs  minute private tarmac meeting with bill clinton shortly before fbi director comey faced the cameras on july  th with his exculpatory announcement 
second at least five immunity agreements were handed out in the email case including to hillarys lawyer and confidante cheryl mills and to platte river networks paul combetta it appears that combetta had previously lied to government investigators  a crime in itself  while trying to cover up the fact that he had evidently bleachbited emails to delete them even though they had been subject to a previously issued congressional subpoena the immunity agreements garnered nothing in return but had the effect of blocking access to the computer devices of the immunity beneficiaries in the fbis separate clinton foundation investigation apparently the department decided against the alternative option of subpoenaing the computer devices or seeking a search warrant rather than granting useless immunities in order to obtain any evidence relevant to the email investigation that might have been contained in those devices 
third the department and fbi did not conduct their last minute interview of hillary clinton under oath and allowed cheryl mills  herself a material witness  to sit in during hillarys interview they did not ask pertinent followup questions there was no verbatim transcript of the interview to use in checking the veracity of hillarys statements during the interview against her sworn congressional testimony or her many public statements 
fourth the department of justice reportedly refused to allow the fbi to issue subpoenas to gather more evidence in connection with its investigation of the clinton foundation payforplay allegations in fact senior department officials reportedly would not authorize a more thorough fbi investigation because they claimed there was not sufficient evidence gathered thus far to justify going further such a circular argument was a mere cover to prevent seasoned career investigators from learning the full extent of foreign government donations while hillary was secretary of state their true motivations and any favors extended by the state department in return 
finally the crossconnections between the clintons and some high level department of justice and fbi officials cry out for recusal but not so in this administration for example the wife of the deputy fbi director who was involved in the laggard clinton foundation investigation andrew mccabe just happened to have received a large donation from close clinton ally virginia governor terry mcauliffe to her  run for the state senate 
to make matters worse the obama department of justice assigned assistant attorney general peter j kadzik a close friend of hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta to communicate with congress about what kadzik promised would be a thorough review of the newly discovered emails from anthony weiners online account 
podesta praised kadzik in an email to an obama campaign official back in  as a fantastic lawyer and said about his pal kept me out of jail their history together goes further back than that during the waning days of bill clintons presidency it was kadzik then representing the infamous billionaire fugitive marc rich who lobbied podesta then serving as bill clintons chief of staff for a presidential pardon on his clients behalf kadziks lobbying effort no doubt helped along by contributions to hillary clintons senate campaign and to bill clintons presidential library paid off bill clinton delivered the requested pardon on his last day in office 
kadzik joined the department of justice in april  first as a deputy assistant attorney general for legislative affairs and then as the principal deputy with the podesta connection intact kadzik has served as a highly placed clinton campaign mole in the department an email dated may   from kadzik to podesta released by wikileaks  proves the point bearing the subject heading heads up kadzik advised podesta about upcoming congressional testimony by the head of the departments civil division and about another filing in the freedom of information case that would mean it will be awhile  before the state department posts the emails podesta forwarded kadziks heads up email to several senior hillary clinton campaign officials with the admonition additional chances for mischief 
exploiting his coordinating role in the reopened email investigation and contacts with fbi investigators kadzik will now be in a position to relay inside information to his pal podesta and to provide inside information to the clinton campaigns supporters in congress as well

Daniel Greenfield,hillary clinton campaign still whining about the fbi,"obama wont vote with america at the un under obama the united states wont defend the united states november   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
a generation ago the communist tyranny in cuba demanded that the united nations condemn america for the embargo the brutal castro regimes rant accused the united states of threatening nuclear annihilation countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders 
on a cold day in october the european leftwing activist serving as un ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the us at the un 
un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain samantha power said 
thank you she added acknowledging the applause 
under obama the united states would no longer defend the united states a generation ago the communists had been in cuba now they were in washington dc 
instead of defending america obamas chosen representative agreed that our communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust she said 
if the cuban representative had been in her place he could not have done much better communist cuban propaganda was now being parroted by ambassador power if the castro dictatorship wanted to save money it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to washington dc 
the cuban ambassador boasted that cuban communists had rid ourselves of us imperialism and proclaimed that we will never go back to capitalism he declared that the resolution was a powerful message to the peoples of the world the message is indeed unmistakable 
ben rhodes the close obama adviser who sold the media on the iran sellout curtly tweeted his justification no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose 
who is this we 
the cuban embargo is the law of the land its the official policy of the united states its based on laws passed by congress and implemented by president john f kennedy and his successors 
this we certainly isnt the united states government its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one 
one member of the we must be ben rhodes because he tells us so who is rhodes an aspiring novelist who pushed obama to back the muslim brotherhood takeover of egypt the iran nuke sellout and now apparently choosing communist cuba over america 
no one has ever elected rhodes to anything but under leftwing rule he outweighs congress president kennedy the law of the land and the national interests of the united states 
we is obama who made the final decision its ambassador samantha power its a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government this is the we that announced its treasonous opposition to the us at the un 
america has a we problem 
if the we of the american left wants to vote its own way it should secede to form its own country 
when president john f kennedy proclaimed the embargo on all trade with cuba he based it on authorization from the congress of the united states that is how our system used to work 
these days el teleprompte in dc decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with iran mandate transgender bathrooms legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in havana and he does so on his own authority and congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists 
thats not how america is supposed to work thats how iran works thats how cuba works 
the first word in the introduction to obamas presidential policy directive on cuba after the date was i obamas basis for his authority is his  announcement letat cest moi obama is the state 
jfk no humble shrinking violet mentions i only in the fourth paragraph after congress what is the context of kennedys i now therefore i john f kennedy president of the united states of america acting under the authority of section a of the foreign assistance act of  
the i of jfk can only act as a servant not a master 
in obamas directive congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism there is no source of authorization for anything other than barack obama there is no law only obama 
now the big we in washington have decided that they will oppose america at the united nations but ben rhodes who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives made an unfortunate slip obama has been accused of louis xivs letat cest moi mentality but ben rhodes isnt saying we are the state instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in america one is us the other is we 
we does not yet entirely control the state but we also feels no obligation to the united states if we agrees with america then we will vote with it at the un if we opposes america then we votes against it we will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests not ours 
we happens to run america but it isnt america its the parasite humped on americas back 
you can call we by many names deep state is one its a coalition of leftwing special interests networking through politics the nonprofit sector and media corporations to control america 
president kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy  we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influenceon infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice 
kennedy was speaking after the recent bay of pigs crisis the foreign assistance act mentioned by him was passed by congress that year while the cuban embargo limited the ability of the castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world it didnt stop the we in washington dc 
it is easy to sit here in the distant future of  and wonder whether cuba matters at all but the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the cold war that struggle did not end when the berlin wall fell it is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by we the people or by the nameless we of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the nomenklatura of the left 
by backing away from america at the united nations the we have announced their independence from the laws responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked 
but the we offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule instead they impose on us the collectivism of yevgeny zamyatins novel we in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the one state that controls every aspect of human life that novel inspired  
what we offer us is what cubas castro wes one state and every communist regime offer us its what george orwell in  summed up as a boot stamping on a human face  forever 
president kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the one hundred and eightysixth year of the independence of the united states of america at the united nations ambassador power cheerfully declared americas enforced submission to the communist demands for cuba

by caleb stephen 
posted friday october   at am edt 
keywords fallout  nuclear  nuclear attack  nuclear attack survival  nuclear bomb  nuclear bomb survival  nuclear power  nuclear radiation  nuclear war  nuke  radiation  survival  tactical nuke with the ongoing tensions between the united states and russia fears of a nuclear world war  breaking out are running at an alltime high 
with that in mind i thought it needful to write an article on how to survive the aftermath of a nuclear fallout obviously we could discuss the likelihood of such an event occurring but that isnt within the scope of this article personally i believe that at this point in time such a scenario is not at all far fetched however the situation is very fluid and thus things could change at any time 
basically theres two main types of nuclear weapons out there first youve got what is known as the tactical nukes and then the intercontinental sort  the stuff that would basically flatten the earth in that case theres no point even trying to survive that im going to be talking about how to survive a tactical nuke incident  dont be anywhere near ground zero 
obviously the first step to surviving the initial explosion is to not be there in the first place of course theres not a ton that you can do if you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time youve just got to hope that you exit this world pretty quick  which would most certainly happen if youre anywhere close to ground zero 
the tremendous heat and sheer force of the explosion is enough to kill anyone and flatten anything within an  km radius of the detonation site the intense thermal radiation emitted by the flash of light at detonation is enough to blind you burn your flesh and start fires in the impact zone 
if youre outside when this happens and you happen to survive you should take immediate cover in a building if you get any debris on you you should wash it off with soap and water as soon as possible 
as a survivor of the initial explosion you now have around  to  minutes to bail out of the area before a lethal amount of radiation fallout comes down from the mushroom cloud in those  minutes you need to get at least  km  mile from the blast zone to survive the fallout however within  hours lethal radiation will spread with prevailing winds so keep moving to safety you should feel for the wind and begin running perpendicular to it  not upwind or downwind  getting to shelter 
if you cant get out of ground zero for whatever reason then you need to get to shelter as soon as possible get into the deepest underground basement that you can find or the highest story above the th level if possible 
if you are in the fallout zone but safely sheltered you need to remain there for at least  days during this time food and water should be carefully rationed and clothing layered up to prevent radiation 
really the best way to survive a nuclear event is to prepare for one 
remember the nuclear fallout shelters of the cold war era well thats what you need to be inside to survive but not just any shelter its got to meet a number of different specifications which i am not going to go into because you can find plenty of information on that if you google how to build a nuclear fallout shelter etc  personal protection measures 
protecting your body from harmful radiation and fallout particles is your number one priority after getting to shelter 
like i said before being prepared prior to such an event is very important which is why its a good idea to carry the gear im going to talk about shortly inside a go bag that you can keep in your car house or workplace 
some quick first aid tips it is necessary that all wounds should be covered to prevent contamination and the entry of radioactive particles any burns caused by radiation must first be washed and then normal burn first aid procedure should be followed 
now lets look at the gear you should have ready before a nuclear attack happens 
gas mask youll need a gas mask to protect your face and respiratory system from airborne pathogens and chemical particles israeli military surplus m gas masks fitted with nato  mm cbrn filters are some of the best and cheapest around yet are getting harder and harder to find these days with huge supplies flying off the shelves in the relatively recent ebola scar i have the m civilian version of this gas mask and its extremely comfortable has a port for a hydration tube and best of all its been tested in real life conditions in the middle east 
military chemical suit these suits provide optimal protection from chemical and biological attacks and are used by the british army these are surprisingly cheap yet are proven to work by soldiers whose lives depend on them in everyday combat situations you can get these for around  from amazoncom 
gloves youre going to need gloves to protect your hands from contact with chemical pathogens and biological particles long chemical resistant gloves can be found online at some supermarkets and hardware stores you can get these at around    depending on the brand etc 
boots in order to have full protection from chemical and biological hazards it is important to have a good pair of rubber overboots to protect your feet and legs from chemical and biological particles from coming into contact with your body ensure that you blouse your trousers inside your boots for maximum protection once again these boots that i recommend are used by the uk military and you can get them on amazoncom for around  
nuclear protection there is a way to reduce the effects of nuclear radiation in your body its called potassium iodide and its available on amazon for less than  for a pack of  tablets what this basically does is it reduces the chances of harmful radioactive iodine from entering your thyroid glands 
if you dont have any of these when a nuclear attack happens you can improvise as i mentioned before clothing should be layered up to prevent radiation contact with the skin cover your eyes with closefitting sunglasses or improvised goggles 
 decontaminating food and water 
water and food will be contaminated by debris from the nuclear fallout making procurement and consumption difficult however it is not impossible to make them safe to consume 
whenever possible try to use water that has been sealed in a container or bottle as you can safely assume that the water inside the sealed container is not contaminated wash the container thoroughly with soap and water or boil it for at least  minutes before breaking the seal if water in sealed containers is not available your next choice only under emergency conditions is water from springs again boil the water for at least  minutes before drinking keep the water covered while boiling to prevent contamination by airborne pathogens 
your last choice only in an extreme emergency where sealed water and spring water are unavailable is to use standing water that found in small pools ponds and basically any water that does not flow contaminants microorganisms and germs can survive easily in stagnant water first boil this water as long as practical to kill all organisms next filter it through a cloth to remove the nasties 
in all cases mentioned above use water purification tablets following all directions on the bottlepackaging after boiling and initial filtration prior to consumption 
like water you can also assume that sealed containers or packages of processed food are safe to ensure safety decontaminate all food containers by washing with soap and water or by boiling the container in water for  minutes this is where it helps to have a decent supply of sealed buckets and containers of militarystyle mres and freezedried foods such as wise foods and mountain house 
you should consider supplementing your sealed rations with local plants animals and produce only in extreme emergencies unfortunately no matter what you do to prepare or decontaminate the food there is no guarantee that cooking will kill all the biological agents 
remember you can survive for a long time without food at least  weeks but can be longer especially if the food you eat may potentially kill you 
if you must use local food select only healthylooking plants animals fruit and vegetables do not select known carriers of organisms such as rats or other vermin always use gloves and protective clothing when handling and dressing animals plants etc cook all plant and animal food by boiling only boil all food for at least  minutes to kill all pathogens do not try to fry bake or roast local food as there is no guarantee that all infected portions have reached the required temperature to kill all pathogens do not eat raw food at all costs 
obviously this article is nowhere near comprehensive but i hope it gives you some idea of what you need to do in order to survive the aftermath of a nuclear attack we can only hope and pray that such an event does not happen and that peace will prevail on this planet you might also like",legorafi.fr,Fake,english,16.684927674847486,47.88118811881188,102,19,9093,1576,4.719543147208122,1576.0,1.2242486146400025,1.6769792585533674,1.6176447518221042,1.6927100737136047,-0.3647381716040714,1.7438823903567675,0.0019035532994923,0.0,0.0012690355329949,0,0,0.0,0.0032053309615621,0.9864,0.1,0.075,0.825,Positive,Very Strong
Henry Wolff,feds  born to illegals in one year would fill city the size of orlando,"hispanic crowd boos marco rubio off stage rafael bernal the hill october   
sen marco rubio rfla took the stage in orlando at calle orange a puerto ricanthemed festival on sunday when some in the crowd started booing npr reported  
the jeering got louder as the cubanamerican senator seeking reelection after dropping his presidential bid earlier this year was introduced 
and when the emcee asked for applause as rubio took the same boos drowned out any supporters in the crowd npr added 
thank you for having me today rubio said in spanish i want you to enjoy this day were not going to talk about politics today thank god for this beautiful day and for our freedom our democracy our vote and our country god bless you all thank you very much 
he left the stage to more boos from the crowd according to the report 
snip 
rubio is running against rep patrick murphy d and the latest average of polls in the race shows rubio ahead by about  points 
murphys campaign seized on the sunday incident and blasted out video it says shows the booing it also noted that murphy attended the festival with a leader for puerto rican communities rep nydia velazquez while marco rubio was booed off the stage 
rubios campaign shared a video with the hill monday that it says counters what the murphy campaign sent out and shows him being greeted enthusiastically as he moves through the crowd 
snip 
festival attendants said they disapproved of rubios endorsement of trump who is deeply unpopular among hispanics 
when we have someone like trump who hits our mexican brothers our latino brothers then you jump on that bandwagon after all that stuff he says not only about you personally    as a latino youre a freaking sellout i would not vote for him if they paid me calle orange attendant angel marin told npr about rubio

Daniel Greenfield,majority of americans side with fbi over hillary,"go to article 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
once upon a time factchecking meant that newspapers radio stations and television news broadcasts were obligated to check their facts before broadcasting or publishing them some newspapers and magazines boasted renowned departments filled with intellectuals whose restless minds roved over each line to ensure that the fewest possible errors would appear under that publications masthead 
but factchecking of the media by itself has declined almost as badly as the roman empire errors routinely appear under storied mastheads followed by corrections that are published as a janitorial duty there is very little concern for the facts even among the great names of publishing and broadcasting 
the media has stopped factchecking itself and it now uses factchecking largely to refer to a type of opinion journalism in which it checks the facts of public figures the fall of factchecking within the media has paralleled the rise of fact checking by the media of its political opponents the media has become factless even as it deploys a term that once meant selfcorrection to instead correct others 
fact checks once meant that reporters were expected to be accurate these days theyre only expected to be politically correct the media deploys fact checks to check political correctness not facts its fact checks routinely venture into areas that are not only partisan but subjective matters of opinion 
consider politicos often mocked fact check of donald trump as to whether isis was indeed unbelievably evil under a banner headline donald trumps week of misrepresentations exaggerations and halftruths it zoomed in on a quote from his florida rally 
were presiding over something that the world has not seen the level of evil is unbelievable trump had said 
politico swooped in to correct the candidate with its fact check judging one level of evil against another is subjective but other groups in recent history have without any question engaged in as widespread killing of civilians as isis 
there were no facts being checked here because politico doesnt seem to know what a fact even is 
the only information conveyed by this fact check is that politico like the rest of the media does not like donald trump and would find a way to argue with him if he said that the sky was blue 
in the daily show media culture where overt bias and trolling are virtues factchecking is just another snotty variety of editorializing that attempts to compensate for perceptions of bias not with higher ethical and factual standards but by rebranding its editorials as fact checks to gain credibility 
the isis evil fact check of trump came from the same media outlet whose white house reporter decided that the wisconsin flag which carries the date  to mark the states admission to the union was a flag for the local union wisconsin  politico ran an entire story asserting that obama was flying a labor flag to oppose governor walker because its reporter couldnt process basic history 
this is what happens when media outlets think that factchecking is something that they do to republicans rather than to themselves 
factchecking was one of those dinosaurs of journalism like objectivity which is viewed as largely irrelevant in a media culture whose edward r murrow is jon stewart todays millennial journalists spend most of their time exchanging sarcastic quips with their peers on twitter aspire to found their own vox sites and write viral blog posts that seek a new angle on a trending leftwing narrative 
fact checks often function as narrative defenses and meme attacks thats why the washington post decided to fact check a saturday night live gag about obamas illegal alien amnesty its not that anyone imagines that saturday night live is in the business of producing facts that need checking the post was just worried that one of its jokes would go viral and hurt obama and his agenda 
its the same reason that the paper fact checked a yearold boy who claimed he was blocked by obama on twitter this isnt about the facts its paranoia about social media narratives going viral 
this is more understandable if you stop thinking of the media in the oldfashioned sense as a series of papers radio and television stations and start thinking of it as a massive machine that advocates for leftwing policies using its massive infrastructure and wealth to monopolize internet narratives 
media outlets trade on their history but they dont resemble their past selves in any meaningful way 
the new yorker once boasted a factchecking department that was famous for its range its depth and its resourcefulness in running down even the most obscure facts but what use is such a thing at david remnicks new yorker whose big draw comes from andy borowitzs insipid near parodies the new republic went from respected liberal publication to another snarky and shrill social justice blog cbs news cited a psychic site to explain that a fly landed on hillarys face to help her cope with stress 
this isnt material that exists in the same realm as facts its snarky contempt alternating with lowest common denominator propaganda leftwing journalism like most leftwing culture is totalitarian antiintellectualism masquerading as enlightened intellectualism the soviet union was quite fond of culture it just hated the creative process that produced it because it was independent of communist ideology the left loves journalism it just hates the objectivity that validates journalism as more than propaganda 
its this perverse antiintellectualism that turned factchecking from selfdiscipline to attack ad once journalism became pure leftwing advocacy it also became inherently correct by virtue of being leftwing and was not in need of having its facts checked when fact checks stopped being something that journalists did to themselves first facts and then fact checks became meaningless unable to even recognize a fact media fact checkers just wrote editorials which spiced their leftwing attacks on republicans liberally with cargo cult invocations to fact as if it were some deity 
the average media fact check is a masterpiece of unintentional comedy for thinking adults 
at the washington post  michelle yee fact checks donald trumps comment that hillarys email scandal is bigger than watergate and concludes that since watergate led to nixons resignation and hillarys email scandal has yet to lead to any convictions it cant be bigger than watergate since the scandal has yet to be resolved a fact check of it could only take place in the future 
cnn featured toronto star fact checker daniel dale who claimed that trump said  lies in one day 
the list of lies included deeming trumps statement that hillary would raise taxes false because her plan only taxes the rich asserting that there is no such thing as a phony poll and denying that hillary clinton had received debate questions some of these lies are themselves lies others like yee show an inability to even understand what a fact is and what can and cant be deemed false 
just how degraded fact checking had become was made manifest when hillary clinton pleaded at the debate please fact checkers get to work her campaign site touted its own fact checking which was mostly indistinguishable from the medias fact checking that was a commentary on the transformation of the media into a leftwing politicians spin center 
nearly every media outlet now boasts a fact check blog or headlines touting fact checks but the biggest fact checking department of the media rather than by the media isnt in the united states but in germany in america fact checking has become a type of partisan attack launched by media outlets at their political opponents its bigger than ever and also more worthless than ever because it is factless

Jason Easley,the banishment of trump has begun as the american people are tuning him out,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on mon oct st  at  pm trump refused  produce records sought by prosecutors for  months said under oath was destroying them whole time share on twitter print this post 
newsweek s kurt eichenwald has struck again reporting that donald trump refused  produce records sought by prosecutors for  months said under oath was destroying them whole time 
the whole strategy he writes at newsweek in an article he swears was written before comeys announcement was deny impede and delay while destroying documents the court had ordered them to hand over 
in  he reveals the republican nominee his father and their real estate company battled the federal government over civil charges that they refused to rent apartments to africanamericans 
shortly after the government filed its case in october trump attacked he falsely declared to reporters that the feds had no evidence he and his father discriminated against minorities but instead were attempting to force them to lease to welfare recipients who couldnt pay their rentthe familys attempts to slow down the federal case were at times nonsensical trump submitted an affidavit contending that the government had engaged in some unspecified wrongdoing by releasing statements to the press on the day it brought the case without first having any formal communications with him he contended that hed learned of the complaint only while listening to his car radio that morning but trumps sworn statement was a lie court records show that the government had filed its complaint at  am and phoned him almost immediately afterward the government later notified the media with a press release  six months after the original filing the case was nowhere because the trumps had repeatedly ignored the deadlines to produce records and answers to questions known as interrogatoriesfinally under subpoena trump appeared for a short deposition when asked about the missing documents he made a shocking admission the trumps had been destroying their corporate records for the previous six months and had no documentretention program they had conducted no inspections to determine which files might have been sought in the discovery requests or might otherwise be related to the case instead in order to save space trump testified officials with his company had been tossing documents into the shredder and garbage 
so trump can accuse hillary clinton of destroying emails  and he does nearly every day  but only as a means of covering up and deflecting his own misdeeds in that regard 
with false affidavits and deny and delay strategies writes eichenwald trump  his cos hid and destroyed records sought in court 
donald trump is a world class liar and a man known for his deflection tactics projecting his own guilt onto others his foundation in trouble point the finger at the clinton foundation sexual assault allegations point the finger at bill and hillary clinton 
once again kurt eichenwald has dug into donald trumps deplorable past and revealed the real donald trump its not pretty and each revelation from eichenwald and david fahrenthold shows trump to be an even worse human being than the last 
it is no wonder his deplorables love him so much

a source said the stress of her political career the neverending scandals and her worsening health plunged her into a lifethreatening booze hell she turned to drink to drown her fears hillary tries to hide her problem like she lies about so many things a close friend of hillary added  hillary has been drinking heavily for years to forget her miserable marriage to serial cheater bill shes also hit the bottle to cope with other stress as well as the boredom of flying all over the world when she was secretary of state 
one hillary insider told the enquirer that hillary has blackouts and wakes up wondering where she is and what she has done  and that shes not fit to be president 
certainly hillary must be drunk when she obscenely ground against the twerking black woman see below because no sane person in her then position as us secretary of state would behave like this in public

Twain Yobra,how to remove uric acid crystallization in joints,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on fri oct th  at  am with the election just  days away trump has only donated just m of the m he promised and wont even invest in his own campaign share on twitter print this post 
you have got to wonder if the trump campaign wishes it had spent less on hats and more on polling now as it is revealed they had only m left in their war chest on october  compared to clintons m probably not there are always others to blame and trumps list of those plotting against him grows in inverse proportion to his polling numbers 
from june  through september  the trump campaign meaning donald trump spent m on hats according to fec filings  they spent just m on polling unsurprisingly they are behind on polling leading in precisely zero  polls  you want to win an election you need sweet hats abraham lincoln 
trump has spent more on hats than direct mail or polling pictwittercomtofdqmq 
 jack minor jr jackminorjr october   
and now clinton has four times the cash 
and the washington post is reporting that in the first  days of october trump only raised half as much as clinton according to campaign finance reports his biggest day was the  million he brought in on the day his sex assault tape was released which tells you all you need to know about his base 
remember when trump claimed he would give m of his own money to his campaign yeah this is a guy who wont even buy his own autographed sports memorabilia he uses other peoples money for that with the election just  days away he has only donated m 
make what you will of this but he had been giving m a month to his campaign in the first  days of october just k in inkind contributions thats right even trump wont invest in his own campaign at this point 
trump pulled in m up to october  down from m in september meanwhile the clinton campaign has pulled in a cool m in that same period she spent less than normal m but that leaves her a war chest of m going into the final stretch 
donald trump says he is a great businessman yet he has spent twice as much on collateral including hats as he has on paying his staff he says he gets only the best people and he bought a lot of his maga hats his campaign site only sells  different styles of hat at  to  apiece 
and according to huffington post  the october  federal election commission filing for trump make america great again committee shows trump spent k of donors money to buy his own book  presumably the art of the deal he profited personally by doing this by way of royalty payments and then turned around and resold autographed copies of the  book at  each 
his campaign pays him to rent his own campaign headquarters yet trump told a crowd in geneva ohio that hillary clinton has never earned an honest dollar well i think thats really you know 
trump is probably the first presidential nominee to try to win the white house while turning a personal profit 
now it looks as though trump has seen a point of diminishing returns he not only did not selffund his campaign as promised he has barely spent half of what he said he would spend down to almost nothing at all as defeat looms and the potential for profit evaporates

The Alex Jones Show,hillary is a real christian says michael moore,"public faith in elections falls as the state grows outofcontrol state power ryan mcmaken  misesorg  october   comments 
in the wake of the final presidential election debate last week the mainstream media was appalled that donald trump would not preemptively agree to not contest the outcome of the election  
trumps position reflects a growing faction of americans who doubt the integrity and honesty of the american electoral system in response mainstream media sources have responded by vehemently insisting that rigged elections are  a myth  
while rarely stated explicitly the way american electoral politics is supposed to work is this the population spends several months listening to the candidates accuse each other of terrible crimes horrible ideas and gross incompetence each candidate lists the ways he or she will use the power of government to force the winners policy preferences on the losers then once the votes are cast everyone is supposed to quickly accept the results ignore everything that was said during the campaign and immediately accept the winner as having an indisputable mandate to rule over everyone including the sizable minority  or even the majority in many cases  who either voted against the winner or abstained if there appears to be any irregularities in the vote well those should just be ignored because it would tear the country apart to drag out the election if half the country feels its been cheated well tough luck and better luck next time democracy breaks down as perceived interventionism increases 
this model can only work indefinitely under certain specific conditions it can be workable when there is a perception that government is limited in its power and extensive or abrupt change to government institutions are thought to be rare it can also work in a small culturally uniform society where there is a relatively small divide between socioeconomic and ethnic groups 
in the case of the united states however it appears that neither of these conditions apply 
in the age of presidential executive orders militarized police uncountable federal laws and a myriad of spy agencies empowered to watch americans every move gone is the perception that a loss in an electoral contest should simply be accepted without question the president says he can issue laws with  a pen and  a phone  without any need to consult congress the libya war proved presidents can invade any country without so much as a debate in congress meanwhile the untouchable supreme court hands down decisions that are equivalent to constitutional amendments some of which can have enormous effects on the daily lives of ordinary citizens 
in other words the stakes are now reaching the point where an attitude of better luck next time doesnt cut it whether or not these fears are at times overstated is irrelevant the fact is the perception of democratic lawlessness is growing 
this situation is further complicated by the fact that the united states is an enormous conglomeration of different cultural and socioeconomic groups spread out over a vast and varied geography many of these different groups distrust each other and in a country where the president and the judiciary now rule largely by proclamation there is reason to be fearful when the other guys candidate wins and yours loses democracy can work when the stakes are low 
contrary to the naive musings of some nostalgic conservatives the united states was never united into a single cultural linguistic or socioeconomic group those differences may have reached a low point during the twentieth century but they were far larger in the th century than they are today 
when you have a diverse population however the problem of who controls the government becomes far more important and this concern grows as the state becomes more powerful writing on the topic of immigration and nationalism in australia  ludwig von mises noted how powerful states exacerbate the problem of cultural divides could a laissezfaire regime be guaranteed to all residents of australia mises notes it would not matter at all if there were cultural mistrust between englishdescended australians and asian newcomers however since laissezfaire liberalism has not been embraced a familiar problem presented itself 
the present inhabitants of australia fear that some day they could be reduced to a minority in their own country and that they would then have to suffer all the horrors of national persecution to which for instance the germans are today ie the early s exposed in czechoslovakia italy and poland 
it cannot be denied that these fears are justified because of the enormous power that today stands at the command of the state a national minority must expect the worst from a majority of a different nationality as long as the state is granted the vast powers which it has today and which public opinion considers to be its right the thought of having to live in a state whose government is in the hands of members of a foreign nationality is positively terrifying it is frightful to live in a state in which at every turn one is exposed to persecution  masquerading under the guise of justice  by a ruling majority it is dreadful to be handicapped even as a child in school on account of ones nationality and to be in the wrong before every judicial and administrative authority because one belongs to a national minority 
it is clear that no solution of the problem of immigration is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state which meddles in every field of human activity or to that of the socialist state only the adoption of the liberal program could make the problem of immigration which today seems insoluble completely disappear in an australia governed according to liberal principles what difficulties could arise from the fact that in some parts of the continent japanese and in other parts englishmen were in the majority 
these same principles can be applied outside the subject of immigration as well the existence of an interventionist state means any country composed of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic groups faces the same problem of one group being exploited by another group with the help of state power change the term nationality to political party or interest groups and one has a fair approximation of the problem of democracy in any interventionist state 
in the presence of a relatively weak government however these concerns are often overstated at the turn of the th century in the us for example the fact that spanishspeakers were in the majority in new mexico and many areas of the american west was irrelevant to the lives of the vast majority of americans the fact that japanese immigrants and their descendant were outcompeting white businessmen in california was simply not a matter of national importance the fact that oregon attempted to outlaw catholic schools was not a matter for presidential executive orders thanks to widespread suspicion of federal power at the time the lack of a strong federal judiciary and a relatively weak presidency meant these issues remained largely local while public policy was haphazard 
voters have always feared losses in elections but now more than ever the voters may be justified in refusing to simply accept the outcomes of elections under an interventionist state which meddles in every field of human activity when that is the case elections are not something to be taken lightly trumps remarks about rigged elections  and public fears over the outcome  are to be expected from voters with an immense fear of outofcontrol state power 
in response to all of this the pundits and government class will tell us that everyone must double down on democracy and that elections  specifically federal ones are sacred rituals never to be questioned there will be a double standard of course a trump victory will be questioned by the media and powerful politicians but in that case it will be the fault of the russians  and not anything wrong with the system itself the solution for the feds of course will be a federal takeover of the election system if clinton wins then no questioning of the system will be tolerated at all to question the outcome or the wisdom of these presidential contests will be denounced as scarcely less than sacrilege 
the true solution to the problem remains far more practical however to paraphrase mises it is clear that no solution of the problem of elections is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state so long as elections are increasingly perceived to be referenda on which side shall use the power of the state to crush the other side faith in the electoral system will erode and the potential for real violence will increase newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,4.452858578534739,46,8,8861,1471,4.998640380693406,1471.0,-0.487953588572627,-0.3899286096724409,1.556264124493856,1.5281035907569058,-0.0892965734017235,1.575427472399178,0.0020394289598912,0.0,0.0013596193065941,0,1,0.0,0.0040914287944441,-0.8691,0.108,0.112,0.78,Negative,Very Strong

Jenny Heth,treat kidney infection with these home remedies,"by rmuse on thu oct th  at  am to avoid climateending global temperature rise it is critical for the world to transition off fossil fuels and embrace renewable clean energy sources share on twitter print this post the following is an opinion column by r muse 
over the past few months there has been a dearth of good news and if there did happen to be anything good to report it was overshadowed by the national clown show that is a typical american election where there has not been one iota of good news is on climate change even dismissing the horrible flooding wildfires droughts sea level rise melting ice caps hurricanes and worldwide food shortages there have only been dire reports on the level of co permeating the atmosphere and the subsequent yearly recordsetting rise in global temperatures 
this week while most americans were living breathing and bleeding over donald trump and the tortuouslylong presidential campaign the international energy agency offered up some good news for the climate the earths population and even for america 
the good news for the planet came in the form of an announcement on tuesday by the international energy agency iea that stated according to new data for the first time renewable energy sources have passed coal as the largest new source of electricity in the world 
it may not seem like such fantastic news but climate scientists the world over have warned that if human beings are going to avoid that climateending degree c rise in global temperatures it is critical for the world to transition off of carbonproducing fossil fuels and embrace renewable clean energy generating sources this is particularly true for getting off dirty coalfired electrical generation plants that are responsible for a quarter of americas c emissions carbon dioxide emissions are one of the main culprits contributing to climate change driven by global warming 
the iea report revealed that solar and wind account for nearly twothirds of current renewable energy growth and interestingly those increases are occurring in and coming from developing and industrialized nations alike for a developing nation it makes perfect sense to embrace cheaper renewable energy as opposed to any fossil fuelgenerated power sources whether they are dirty coalfired plants or notquiteasdirty natural gasburning generating plants 
the iea also revised its earlier projections for renewable energys continued expansion and growth and  significantly increased the amount of  green energy  it expects to  come on line  over the next five years renewable energy includes socalled green sources such as biomass biogas eligible biomass and small hydroelectric sources according to the environmental protection agency epa both terms renewable and green energy include solar and wind generating sources and depending on the context they can be interchangeable 
in addition to prorenewable policies such as the paris climate agreement and to a lesser extent the americachina deal to roll back coalgenerated emissions there has been a significant price decline that is helping drive the growth in renewables particularly in solar and the iea projected that the worldwide costs for solargenerated power will continue declining by an additional  percent over the next five years onshore wind generated electricity costs will drop by at least another  percent during that same fiveyear period 
although the iea report was incredibly good news for the entire planet there was some extra good news in the report about americas transition to renewable energy according to the ieas mediumterm renewable market report the united states is adding renewables at a faster rate than demand is growing what that means for the climate is that renewables are not only covering the everincreasing demand for electricity but are now supplanting some fossil fuel electricity still america has a long way to go because wind and solar generating sources make up a small portion of americas electricity 
in time and if the koch brothers allow it america may catch up to stilldeveloping nations where renewable energy accounts for about half of new electric power sources industrialization is fueling a rapid increase in demand for electricity that is best generated with cheaper renewable energy 
although there appears to be no downside in this bit of good news the growth of renewable energy does have economic implications the dirty coal industry is facing some struggles?in part due to the glut of oil and lower national gas prices financial mismanagement and new cleanair regulations but the amount of co driving climate change is a testament that they have had a good long reign in providing dirty fuel to generate electricity it is noteworthy that as coal jobs may be declining the solar industry is growing and thriving to more than take up the slack in any lost coal jobs 
the iea couldnt pass up the chance to note one sticking point in their otherwise encouraging report  persistent challenges of heating and transportation energy  that renewables are not affecting however since the iea only monitored and tracked the worlds transistor from oil and gas to biofuels they note that as electric and hybrid vehicles continue to increase around the world they will be connected to the same electrical grid that is steadily getting a little greener significantly cheaper and one hell of a lot more friendly for the climate and the people 
it is a mystery how republicans beholden to the koch brothers and dirty fossil fuel industry particularly the dirty coal industry will absorb this good news in the past eight years republicans  the kochs their lobbyists at the heritage foundation americans for prosperity and the american legislative exchange council alec have made killing renewable energy one of their primary goals it is likely that the ieas report will signal they are not winning the war on renewable energy and in the past that may have been worrisome but now that more americans are benefitting from renewable energy particularly solar republicans will have a difficult time convincing them to stop getting free electricity from the sun and saving the climate for their childrens future something the ieas report never mentions

childoffather,more footage of operation high jump with hitler,the moon that fell from heaven page  link there is an intriguing text from anatolian myth with regards to the moon falling from heaven the moon god fell from the sky and fell upon the gate complex but no one saw him the storm god sent rain after him he sent rains after him fear seized him anxiety seized him the god hapantali went there he stood beside him and uttered over him the words of a spell the goddess kamrusepa looked down from the sky and said what in the world has happened here a good question from kamrusepa there then but the text is fragmentary and partial and the matter isnt really explained so anyway the first question then is were was this gate complex and why couldnt he the moon be seen having landed my consideration is that the gate complex is that of the cilician gates  and that the moon can no longer be seen as he has infused the taurus mountains with silver that region did relate to the silver mountains as several sources mention and was a major centre for the trade in silver at kultepekanes the essence of the trade was to ship tin woolen textiles and lapis lazuli to anatolia to sell it there in order to acquire directly or indirectly silver and gold which was shipped back to assur tin essential for the anatoian production of bronze was imported in assur from susa perhaps by elamite caravans and ultimately originated from central asia assyrian trade colony at kanes there are a great many tablets related to this trade recovered from kultepe on these sometimes can be seen the taurus bull that bears upon its back the silver mountain also seen beneath on that example is the scorpion which was likely also an ideogram based upon the cilician gates and greater region also the symbol of ishara the goddess of the silver mountain and related to concept idea of the moon within the underworld her symbolic metal silver and purity through refinement the temple of ishara being at kanes or nesi to the hurrians there were a great many ideas bound up within this symbolism then including in cosmological terms the entrance into the underworld being above taurus in gemini and its opposite point of emergence in scorpio according to the intersection point of the galactic and ecliptic planes were this gets interesting is that there is a hurrian myth that relates to a conflict in the primeval period named the song of silver involving their tutelary god tessub and his ongoing issues with kumarbi god of destiny among tessub the sun god of the sky sauska ninevehs queen and all the gods no one worships him although his power is greater than their power his word is greater than their words his wisdom is greater than their wisdom his battle and his gory are greater than theirs it is silver the fine of whom i sing wise men tod me the story of the fatherless boy it did not exist long ago silvers father had disappeared and they do not know his spendor heroic men ran to battle abundance did not exist and grain did not grow only hunger the songs of the kumarbi cycle can contain veiled allegory regarding ethnic disputes such as i outlined here with regards to byblos and ebla it is likely the same in this case conflict with the region of nesa and the silver mountains this however relating to a much earlier period potentially also this relates to conflict from the heavens as silver could be named kubbabaranzu as noted here the association with anzu in conflict with tessub relating to the same with ninurta in the sumerian mythos and that seemingly from anatolia the identification of silver as dumu also correlates with the sumerian notion of the divine child as damu often seen as the basis for the cult of dumuzid were it was also the case that the city of dumuzid badtivira was the centre of the sumerian metallurgy industry silver is described in this text as a wannumiyas dumu which means a child whose father is dead or missing hittitologists generally translate this as orphan silvers consternation at being told by the orphan boy that he too was an orphan need not mean that he was discovering this for the first time the song of silver again is fragmentary but does seem to involve silver at some point establishing his power silver seized power with his hands silver seized the spear he dragged the sun and moon down from heaven the sun and the moon did reverence they bowed to silver the sun and the moon began to speak to silver o silver our lord do not strikekill us we are the luminaries of heaven and earth we are the torches of what lands you govern if you strikekill us you will proceed to govern the dark lands personally his soul within him was filled with lovehe had pity on them in dragging the sun and the moon down from heaven again it could be considered that is what had infused the mountains with gold and silver but also it could relate to the establishment of the cults of allani and ishara at the time of silver the spiritual qualities brought down to earth hopefully in the future more complete accounts of these texts will emerge as they are most intriguing and almost completely overlooked apart from specialists in the field which is a pity as they are more interesting than most edit on kamvamericachicagothursday by kantzveldt because no reason

SUPREMEMASTER,obsolete,"home this month popular  things indian guys have to understand when learning game  things indian guys have to understand when learning game february    comments culture 
as a guy of indian ethnicity there are some obstacles you have to overcome in order to have a balanced game circumstances can dictate what these are but following my last post a red pill infused indian pal of mine and myself had a conversation about what these obstacles are  let go of limiting beliefs about being an indian in the western world 
what do i mean by limiting beliefs there is a particular mindset among indian guys that they can only get with indian girls you must let go of these fears dictating that your ethnicity holds you back in what you can do being indian does not mean you have to work in it accounting business construction or own a corner shop as in the same way it does not mean you have to date indian girls  let go of your mummys sari 
its something ive noticed among the large indian community here in london there are a large number of mummys boys men who are afraid to stand up to their mothers and what they want themselves no one wants to disrespect their parents but also at the same time standing up for what you want should be your primary objective many a man will settle with their girlfriends due to pressure from their mothers as one acquaintance said he preempted conflict by just doing what his mother wanted even though he does not love the girl he married  let go and expand beyond your indian comfort zone 
your extended family plays a large part of your life not a bad thing but a lot of guys also have their friends circle exclusively indian expand your knowledge gain new friends travel and learn new languages its a difficult transition to move from becoming over reliant on this little setup to independence from all influence but it can be done and it will benefit your internal well being the thing to remember is you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with it is highly likely none of your existing five friends will agree with your path into game they will tell what is best for you but in essence this is them subconsciously pulling you back down to their value as you increase your own  stop putting white women on a pedestal 
white women are easy white women are fun white women are flirts white women are great at sex or white women are sluts whatever white women are as an indian guy you must stop putting them on a pedestal for being all these sexually related things that you think indian girls are not there is no magical things that white women do that others do not besides there is not a certain place in the world where white women will see you and jump on your cock as there is not a certain bollywood film that will make a white woman gush all wet and demand you ravage her aryan style white woman pedestalization can be categorized as an inferiority complex displayed by indian men stop thinking youre inferior to any woman regardless of her ethnicracial origins  understand that indian girls are not different and are not more chaste 
being constantly around these indian girls at family gatherings community events and religious events makes you programmed into believing that you will marry one for certain because of their chaste and low promiscuity a strong belief that indian girls dont ride the cock carousel is blind faith because they do in fact all women in the western world do regardless of culture and their strong family traditional values they are women they get pussy tingles to the same game as white black asian orange maroon and kiwi women they have the same subconscious processes as all women that help them place a value on a man and inevitable slamming and spunk gobbling if he passes with flying colors in a western society these girls have the same external pressures and influences that appeal to their inner slut as much as any other woman your objective as a man is not to fall into the line of romantic thinking that they are different  do not be afraid of the man 
theres a man a dominant man somewhere in your family he dictates he dominates and he makes the decisions you have a fear of causing him displeasure you do as he says as hes done the leading since your father emptied his ball sack into your mother stop as much as a lot of indian men have pressures from being mummys little lad theres plenty of them that disintegrate under the pressure of their fathers or uncles avoiding conflict is prevalent in your attitude you do as you are told even though your mind is telling you this is not in your interest and possibly not in the wider interests of those close to you but you do it as uncle or dad has told you to 
no one is telling you to fight but start slowly speak out say what you think is best for you get out of your shell and decide how you will live your life not how dad thinks you should live your life you might be scared of the conflict and dissuade yourself from it but trust me when you finally grow some balls and exude some confidence and ability in yourself these men will respect you see you as equal and place trust in your decisions 
this list could also apply to other cultures who follow similar dynamics to indian culture but dont stop at the above and think thats all you have to doyou still have to hit the ground running and approach just like any other guy learning game",prisonplanet.com,Fake,english,20.8,3.528806933996037,8,1,5405,992,4.429435483870968,992.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.705233616725228,0.6419044346385702,0.7771844923163461,-0.6510459842701822,0.8069521800021745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9774,0.123,0.106,0.771,Positive,Very Strong

cnn anchor hala gorani wasnt expecting her network to be called the clinton news network by british firebrand conservative columnist katie hopkins from the daily mail and watching the ensuing implosion is a mustsee 
hopkins first offense was daring to believe donald trump is going to win the election  never a good way to start on cnn 
i think hes going to win i think you guys are in for a big surprise which im quite excited about i think weve seen a very similar think here in the uk with brexit we saw a lot of the liberal press kind of sneering at brexiteers we saw a lot of the sneering that we see from the clinton news network 
thats cnn youre calling us the clinton news network gorani said in shock 
youre exactly correct hopkins said 
the two argued over how the media are obsessed with polls especially the ones showing hillary clinton in the lead hopkins destroyed gorani saying having sat in the republican national convention in cleveland and watched your news network it is entirely biased i think in coverage 
gorani refused to believe and said over her year career at cnn shes only seen nothing but balance at the network

National Geographic,exclusive christs burial place exposed for first time in centuries,"chinese university sells hiv testing kits in vending machine china has a  yearoveryear increase of the disease image credits david pursehouseflickr  
china has experienced such a growth rate of hiv in the past several years that one university has taken steps to allow students to test themselves by placing an hiv testing kit in a vending machine next to regular fare like snacks 
china has seen a  yearoveryear increase in infection rates which likely prompted southwest petroleum university in nanchong city in sichuan province to install the test kits  
sichuan province is one of the top three provinces in china with a disproportionately high rate of hivaids together with the other two provinces that have high rates of the disease the three account for over half of the cases of hivaids in the entire country 
 of new hiv cases occur due to homosexual activity 
the kits retail for  and can be taken as a urine test to determine whether or not students need to seek medical attention those who purchase the test will collect their urine and send it to a laboratory and then access the results online this can all be done completely anonymously 
similar kits can be purchased online but they retail for around  the cheaper vending machine tests are just as accurate and are partially subsidized by a charity to allow the test to be more accessible 
reports state that the chinese have limited sex education and very little is discussed about hiv or aids many students who suspect they may have the disease do not seek medical help because of its link to homosexuality those who do have hiv are often thought to be pariahs by their families and friends because of its connection with samesex encounters 
the disease is mostly spreading amongst young homosexual men but as with anywhere else women who do not use proper protection are also susceptible to becoming infected 
doctors have stated that most young people who have become infected with hivaids in china lacked proper education and did not take appropriate precautions for prevention 
the joint united nations programme on hivaids unaids states that there are currently about half a million people in china living with hiv or aids however this figure may be inaccurate due to underreporting",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,2.2264292892673696,66,10,2255,378,4.923280423280423,378.0,0.1235471982890264,-0.0141271790859303,-0.1914963243441121,-0.1853715127828264,-0.1636694607681877,-0.1781080069117301,0.0026455026455026,0.0,0.0026455026455026,0,0,0.0377570191766465,0.0046845570698787,0.5737,0.064,0.042,0.894,Positive,Strong

KD7ONE,no title,"donald trump is the candidate for americans not special interests donald trump is the candidate for americans not special interests luke stranahan 
luke stranahan is an engineer by trade and an armed patriot by inclination he writes for return of kings as a leisure pursuit and an attempt to do his part to help reverse the slide into moral decrepitude of modern society follow him on twitter november   politics 
next tuesday is the american election and for better or for worse well pick the next president at that time assuming we dont get mired in voter fraud and recounts and well either brace for government mandated sjw enemas or bask in a temporary setback of those evil people but today i want to talk on trump once to match an article from last week and i intend to focus on how he is the american candidate as opposed to the special interest groups one 
i had a conversation last week with some people who acted as sjws but were later presented by a mutual friend as libertarian the discussion immediately went nasty with my opposition painting trump and anyone who supported him as a racist and a bigot upon trying to determine why two of the lefts ubiquitous labels were applied to me this time i learned that their perspective was unless you were universally for all special interest groups you were a bigot or a racist false dichotomy and the american nightmare 
the problem i found out was that these people have distilled the political spectrum down into a black or white situation either you want all refugees here from the middle east all the hispanics from any country south of the border to come here freely and citizenship for those already here and that any black people shot by police are just misunderstood and were turning their lives around or youre a racist theres simply no middle ground 
they dont understand that trump is not a special interest candidate by which i mean that he is not going to put any minority group ahead of the rest of us at our expense but he is not racist towards minorities or sexist towards women 
it is possible to be against illegal immigration but treat americans of hispanic ancestry as valued citizens whom you will represent it is possible to be against feminism affirmative action and the persecution of men for the profit of women yet still value american women as americans themselves it is possible to note that some black people cause a disproportionate amount of crime yet note that some police are racist and see that there are bad and good cops and bad and good black people 
the american dream is that all men are created equal and thats men as in humanity not just males it is not that all men are equal and theres a big difference to note here you have the same opportunities as everyone else when you are born with the exception of disability and i do not know anyone myself included that is against governmental aid for the disabled 
what we have instead is the american nightmare where the left uses government and taxes for the most inane of causes trying to fix any disadvantaged groups lot real or imagined so that things will be better they take from the producers and give to the nonproducers so that according to their idealistic vision they will suddenly become productive members of society or become addicted to the welfare tit and vote democrat for the rest of their lives the good of the country over that of the individual 
long gone are responsible democrats like kennedy who told us to ask what you can do for your country every recent democratic president from carter to obama and most of the democrat congressmen view the working middle class of the country as simply a group to exploit for their pet special interest groups trump is the first candidate in a long time who isnt for the blacks or the gays or the muslims or the feminists or whatever and that matters a lot 
the reason why not being for a special interest group which is all that hillary is for with her youth vote black vote womens vote gay vote etc is so important is that these groups even put together do not matter when it comes down to the good of the country dont get me wrong theres plenty of good hardworking black people just like theres the same for women and for gays and for young people but these hardworking folks from all these groups arent going to be part of the blm or la raza or lamda because theyre too busy being productive americans activism is for unemployed people 
whats going to happen if we dont placate blm and just ignore them they riot a bit more and some get arrested what if we told them that people that commit crimes to protest being treated like they commit a lot of crimes is assbackwards thinking and counterproductive to their goals theyd quit rioting 
what would happen if we shut the mexican border down to illegal immigration but made a straightforward but strict path to citizenship for hispanics that wanted to be citizens what if we said this is america we appreciate your culture and encourage to preserve it and your language in your children but the national language is english and all business and schooling will be done in it and in it only and its your choice to not learn it but the difficulties that will arise from that choice are all on you theyd be americans proud of their heritage and their legal immigration and citizenship as well 
what would happen if we told gay people that its cool if they have civil unions under the law and have the same rights as everyone else but its not cool trying to pick a fight with a christian bakery to make the government hall monitor come drive them out of business just because their belief in their god and that youre sinning makes you uneasy and worried that they might actually be right 
what if we told them its ok to do whatever you want with another consenting adult but you dont have to try to make fiveyearolds decide if theyre gay or straight when they shouldnt be wondering about that till puberty hits theyd be normal americans who just happen to like sex with the same gender and theyd quit pushing their agenda and being obnoxious and in the rest of our faces 
what would happen if we talked to muslims and said that there is a huge deafening silence when it comes to the subject of islamic terrorism from them that makes it hard to trust any of them what if we told them that we needed their help to bring the religion out of its tacit acceptance and support of terrorism and part of that help means supporting us vetting muslims coming here more strictly until they are no longer statistically more likely to be terrorists than people of other religions and ethnicities theyd go along with that and maybe realize were fixing a problem not hating a people 
what would happen if we told women that feminism has all but killed modern marriage due to universal punishment of divorced men and that no punishment for falserape accusers both makes men not trust women and insults any real rape survivor what would happen if we told them that giving them jobs for their genitalia over their skills is destroying industries by lowering the only standard that matters that of merit that of excellence 
what if we told them that gender ratios and quotas may fix the macro view of sexism but make the man passed over for the position solely because you were female pissed as all hell towards women and when you do that to the majority of men youll be just as successful and just as hated by men as men were and were hated by you in years past theyd realize that its not a competition its a cooperation and maybe skill should be valued over sex 
what would happen if we stopped all these divisive issues that really dont do anything other than tear us apart and work on a better economy on rights for all on border security what would happen if we simply looked at each other as americans and put us all of us first what would happen if we ripped out the crap in the federal government that overtaxes people or deploys armed forces against our own countrymen what would happen if we made the supreme court constitutional again and made term limits a reality for congress maybe we could get a government for by and of the people again maybe america can indeed by great again like the man says conclusion 
im not in a special interest group no president outside of george w bush right after the september th attacks that i can recall since my childhood has been for me as an american ive always been someone to be taxed to be disarmed to be hated to be blamed its not racism or bigotry to want us all to be treated as equals and not be penalized for real and imagined wrongs that occurred in the past before i was born or more recently yet with which i had nothing to do

speaking at reverend samuel delevoe memorial park in fort lauderdale tuesday night hillary clinton was interrupted by a donald trump supporter who shouted bill clinton is a rapist he was no doubt working for the  reward offered by infowars but clinton was having none of it rather than ignoring the man she issued a stern rebuke stabbing her finger at the man she said 
you know i am sick and tired of the negative dark divisive dangerous vision and behavior from people who support donald trump 
the man continued to shout waving his sign and the crowd countered with cries of hillary hillary as she said 
it is time for us to say no we are not going backwards were going forward into a brighter future 
the protester was escorted out by security and clinton told the man and everyone like him you may be angry about something but anger is not a plan dont be used dont be exploited 
see the protesters antics here note that he was neither roughed up nor attacked by clinton supporters 
sadly all too many angry white christians are allowing themselves to be exploited by donald trump who represents the very forces that have deprived them of the american dream a man whom as clinton says has taken everything and given nothing

a large map with the slogan pray for the redoubt hangs behind the till at warren campbells army surplus store located just outside coeur dalene idaho 
campbell moved his family from california about a year and a half ago in part because he believes the us economy is on the verge of collapse but also to get more god and less government in his life and to live around likeminded people 
the american redoubt is a stronghold its the last bastion for god country liberty constitution second amendment and home schooling he said warren campbell inside his army surplus store redoubt surplus and tactical near coeur dalene idaho erin collinscbc 
a redoubt is a littleused military term that refers to a temporary fortification the american redoubt is both a movement and an unofficial geographic zone that includes idaho wyoming montana and the eastern parts of washington and oregon 
the term was coined in  by survivalist james wesley rawles who identified the region as the best place to wait out a disaster in the us be it natural economic or political 
rawles sees the redoubt as a place where mostly conservative christian americans who are worried about the future should move and prepare for the worst the goal is to create a safe haven where likeminded americans many of whom refer to themselves as preppers can live off the land be more selfsufficient and wait out the calamities to come the holy cause of liberty 
past the tactical gear and through a hallway at the back of redoubt surplus and tactical  youll find pastor warren campbells other venture the lordship church  
adorned in military garb and sporting an abe lincolnstyle beard campbell sets out folding metal chairs to get ready for his weekend service where about three dozen people usually come to hear him preach 
we love to preach on liberty the holy cause of liberty  george washington called liberty a sacred fire and our liberties are very very dear to us especially the liberties we have in jesus christ pastor warren campbell inside his makeshift church connected to his army surplus store in northern idaho erin collinscbc 
campbell says hes met dozens of people who have recently moved to the area mostly from california and colorado because theyre frustrated with what they feel is government overreach including rising taxes stiffer gun regulations and the affordable care act or obamacare 
he says hell likely vote for republican presidential candidate donald trump on nov  primarily because he believes a hillary clinton administration would erode religious freedoms and the right to bear arms 
and despite the polls campbell believes trump will win if he doesnt he expects the redoubt will get a lot more crowded 
i think we will see a great influx of people more than we are seeing right now multiplying by thousands coming here for safety and refuge 
with all the mudslinging and scandal that has defined this us presidential campaign perhaps it shouldnt be surprising theres talk of political migration 
once again this election cycle some democrats including several celebrities  have threatened to move to canada should their candidate lose 
folks in the redoubt suspect plenty of trump supporters will consider a move of their own if their candidate loses although not quite as far north people want to feel safe 
a short drive away customers peruse the display cases at ed santoss busy post falls gun shop and shooting range theyre served by staff wearing side arms who show off everything from handguns to automatic weapons 
the american redoubt is a stronghold its the last bastion for god country liberty constitution second amendment and home schooling  warren campbell owner of redoubt surplus and tactical 
santos says many of the people coming through his shop these days are new arrivals looking for a fresh start and a quieter more peaceful life 
many of the things that attracted my wife and i to this area are the same things that are attracting people today  people want to live in a place that feels like a community people want to feel safe when they go out at night 
santos a former army officer cop and minor pro hockey referee says the facility is signing up new members every day and many of them the vast majority of them in fact are from out of this area ed santos fires a pistol inside the gun range attached to his port falls idaho gun shop 
more than  kilometres east that search for safety and community drew chuck leveque and his wife to a wooded property in the isolated foothills of flathead county mont 
the former las vegas vice cop says his biggest worry is that terrorists could knock out americas electrical grid 
leveque opens the creaky doors of a large shipping container in his yard to show how hes prepared for the threat 
this is our fuel storage container and we have a tank with  gallons of diesel and a tank with  gallons of nonethanol regular gasoline 
the fuel will run leveques generator in the event of a prolonged power outage he says hes stored enough food and water for him and his wife to survive for up to four years 
but leveque believes he will also need to protect what hes stored from those who are less prepared so like many people here in the redoubt he has stockpiled weapons and ammunition too chuck leveque opens up the sea lift container that holds two tanks of fuel to run his generator in case the power grid goes down erin collinscbc 
the us and montana in particular is a gun culture and in the event of a large catastrophe we would need the guns to defend ourselves against people who would want to take our property and our preparedness stores 
in the meantime he worries the countrys political and economic power is waning saddled with too much debt and a political system that has ground to a halt 
its a problem he expects will get worse after the presidential campaign 
no matter which way the election turns out there is going to be a lot of angst by either side canning bullion and bullets 
inside a nondescript industrial mall near kalispell mont dj lebaron puts the finishing touches on a can of dehydrated eggs inside his store big sky preppers  
lebaron who is originally from southern alberta provides survival products and training including how to can everything from gold bullion to bullets 
you want to pack them tight so that they dont sound like bullets if somebody shakes it he said 
for lebaron life in the redoubt is about hoping for the best and preparing for the worst its a mantra he adopted while working with fema americas disaster management agency during the earthquake that rocked the san francisco bay area in  
when bad things happen people that you have called your friends for years are no longer your friends he said when people are cold tired and hungry they forget all about friendships 
his biggest worry is that a natural disaster like an earthquake or flood will disrupt normal life in america but he says the growing uncertainty about americas political and economic future is a close second 
he says trump presents conservatives in the redoubt with a difficult choice this election 
people if they are voting are going to be voting for trump but people dont want trump because nobody can control him and they are worried about what he will do so i guess i will call that a manmade disaster 
he expects the divisions this presidential campaign has reinforced across the country will remain long after the election and will feed some americans desire to retreat to the redoubt

the election campaign might be over but the mainstream medias campaign against president elect donald trump is in full swing 
between all of the fake polling intentionally proclinton partisan coverage and mainstream media collusion with the democratic national party and the clinton campaign exposed through wikileaks podesta email dump  nearly the entire us mainstream media is now in full damagelimitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left 
its now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence while promoting unfounded fears  and all the while pushing fictional hate crime hoaxes 
cbs news flagship investigative program  minutes conducted a recorded interview with trump on friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to stop it in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public or at schools in light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked america since the election results were announced last week it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by trump but instead mainstream cbs buried it for  days until  minutes was scheduled to air later on sunday evening nationwide if cbs had any credibility remaining this certainly will have finished it off 
when told about alleged reports of a trump supporter who were said to have been harassing latinos and muslims following his presidential win trump told interviewer leslie stahl  i am so saddened to hear that he then added and i say stop it if it helps i will say this  and i will say right to the cameras stop it 
one big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did stahl give any specifics on these alleged abuses by trump supporters against muslims and latinos and even though its obvious that trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses  stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf  without offering any evidence to support her claim this was driveby media at its worst in fact not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media and some may end up actually being mediagenerated rumors or even hoaxes 
now its perfectly understandable that trumps victory over the establishments heavily inflated candidate hillary clinton has left many democrats especially millennial collegeaged students upset angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos they are not upset that trump won as much as they are upset that they lost the real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of americas politically correctobsessed young adults the real danger is that democratic party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging and fabricating hate crime incidents in order to propagate the idea that the president elect and his supporters are somehow causing many minorities fearful about the future in reality much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets 
in fact one muslim female from louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged hate crime incident  one designed to discredit trump and to help stoke more nationwide protests 
buzzfeed reported via religion of peace  
a woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the university of louisiana at lafayette including one wearing a donald trump hat made up the story police said in a statement 
the woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab a scarf sometimes worn by muslim women the advertiser reported 
lafayette police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation the paper reported 
during the course of the investigation the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males the statement reportedly read 
note this story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of selfdescribed journalists who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of americas corrupt liberal mainstream media 
thats right  this was just another hoax 
violent democraticaffiliated street gangs 
what leslie stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at cbs and  minutes have obscured is the fact since tuesdays election nearly all of the socalled violent hate crimes have been carried out against trump supporters  by street gangs who are most clearly democrat party supporters 
here are just a few examples michellemalkin even high school kids are not spared student trump supporter attacked at woodside high school httpstcoetvvdjo 
 mama angel mommysaurus november   
watch this clip taken from the radical leftist portland protests this weekend where democratic party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a trump supporter these violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the democratic party and the sitting president of the united states barack obama  are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the democratic partys online community organizer network moveonorg  a digital platform partly funded by leading clinton donor and billionaire george soros  watch this stunning clip 
 here is a video of clip of a white male in chicago  yr old david wilcox who was driving and scraped another vehicle when the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information wilcox was greeted by a gang of africanamericans presumably democratic party supporters who began pointing and shouting you voted for donald trump before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight he was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital 
from reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did wilcox display any support for donald trump it appears as if they attacked him because he was white so could one call this a case of black on white racism regardless its political intimidation done on the street  which could also be defined as pure political fascism in this instance the violence was partisan and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial democrat foot soldiers  enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of america watch this disturbing video  agitator and chief where is obama 
these incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national us media who are obviously still working to discredit the trump presidency 
amidst all this violence however where is the current president obama or the democratic partys losing candidate hillary clinton  to help calm street thugs and violent progressives its almost as if obama and clinton are enjoying the unrest most certainly though obama clinton and the democratic party are hoping to use this weeks mediagenerated liberal angst as future political leverage 
what used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program  minutes has gradually become a joke it seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest opting instead for running bland people magazine and time magazinestyle safe segments judging by its plummeting ratings and its predictable cast of job for life governmentapproved media gatekeepercumcommentators like anderson cooper and lesley stahl there is little hope for this institution you might even say its irredeemable  
one of the corporate mainstreams worst offenders during the election was cnn host brian stelter photo left whose own show is ironically titled reliable sources stelter is meant to be cnns media watchdog person laughably given the lofty title as senior media analyst after leading cnns own exposed efforts to obscure and derail trumps presidential run while working to cover for a hugely unpopular even among democrats hillary clinton candidacy stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his networks horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of us elections but its too late the damage has already been done and cnn will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain they are a dirty media outlet and now everyone knows it 
now cbs news has been exposed in public view but their crime is even worse than cnns which was just dirty politics in comparison cbs news took it upon itself to compromise public safety and put lives at risk  all for its own selfish institutional political position twenty years ago this might have been considered shameful but in todays toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses  they are all way past shameless at this stage 
none of them can be trusted anymore  only tolerated in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years

No Author,une fan demande le remboursement de son tatouage après avoir appris la séparation des frero delavega  le gorafi,"keywords cardiovascular  diabetes  dietary fat  heart disease  sugar  sugar industry 
sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease when it comes to dietary claims made by the sugar industry we need to take them with a grain of salt 
researchers at the university of california san francisco have uncovered documents and communications dating back as far as the s revealing that the srf sugar research foundation now known as the sugar association funded research to serve its own interest to create a sweet image of sugar 
at the time heart disease was on the rise as was the consumption of dietary fat and sugar instead of trying to determine the true cause for the higher occurrence of the disease the biased research focused everyones attention on fat 
ucsfs finding published in jama internal medicine shows researchers at leading universities including harvard were paid by the srf in an effort to portray dietary fat as the major cause of heart disease in the process sugars role in the fatal disease has been ignored singing the praises of lowfat foods 
as a result of the biased research published in many esteemed publications life in the second half of the th century was filled with misleading dietary recommendations and scary headlines 
warnings regarding the dangers of dietary fat ran rampant eating fat especially the saturated variety was equivalent to clogging your arteries even eating an egg containing  grams of the forbidden macronutrient was considered a luxury not to be indulged in more than once per week 
lowfat diets became the craze in fact lowfat labels decorated food packaging throughout groceries stores from yoghurt aisles to frozen sections consumers felt good whenever they chose lowfat varieties over standard options 
yet this sense of wellbeing generated by the lowfat fad was unfounded to add flavour to lowfat foods sugar was the usual substitute and the truth that has been uncovered is that sugar is a secret killer it contributes not only to obesity and diabetes but also to the leading cause of death worldwide cardiovascular disease cvd a time for change 
recently the sugar industrys funded research has been challenged by unbiased studies which reveal sugar to possess the unwelcome property previously and falsely attributed to fat it leads to atherosclerosis 
jama internal medicine has published a study by a team of ucsf researchers showing that sugar aside from causing diabetes and tooth decay sets into motion several changes that bring on heart disease in this study the diets of  children were changed to replace added sugar with starch while maintaining the same amounts of protein fat complex carbohydrates and total caloric intake the results showed beneficial effects on ldl cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as diastolic blood pressure 
another study undertaken by researchers from saint lukes mid america heart institute and albert einstein college of medicine and published in progress in cardiovascular diseases showed that consuming diets high in added sugar caused an increase in ldl bad cholesterol total cholesterol and triglycerides while lowering hdl good cholesterol 
the new research results have brought about a change in worldwide dietary guidelines from governmental associations to medical organisations and private practitioners are warning consumers and patients about sugars toxicity 
the us dietary guidelines for  to  recommend that added sugars make up less than  percent of a persons daily calorie consumption while the main reason for this recommendation is that added sugar constitutes empty calories and leads to a nutrientdeficient diet the guidelines also acknowledge that there is strong evidencelower intake of sources of added sugars are associated with reduced risk of cvd in adults 
the american heart association warns that too much added sugar in your diet could significantly increase your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease it recommends lowering dietary sugar intake even further to a maximum of  teaspoons and  teaspoons for women and men respectively how can something sweet be so bad 
according to one cardiologist dr stephen sinatra sugar delivers its damage to the cardiovascular system via a surge in insulin high levels of insulin wreak havoc on blood vessels endothelial linings an inflammatory response ensues causing the walls of the blood vessels to become clogged in this way the stage is set for heart disease 
add to that the wellknown fact that sugar leads to diabetes which raises the risk of heart disease and the overall danger is compounded addictive properties exacerbate the problem 
it seems that the sugar industry pushed us toward a secret killer just like the tobacco industry did this notion seems even more valid in light of medical claims that sugar like nicotine is an addictive substance 
in medical circles addiction is an altered state of the brain which causes repetitive behaviour despite negative consequences experts state that studies on rats prove sugar to be more addictive than cocaine 
when our bodies digest sugar they release dopamine and opioids these neurotransmitters play a key role in the brains reward centre which in turn causes addiction to the same substance that set off too much activity in this pleasure circuit so what do we do now 
we need to gather public funding to carry out unbiased research on consumer goods including foods 
food labels should allow consumers to identify easily how much added sugar is present in every food item 
every processed food item should not be allowed to contain more than  percent of its total calories from added sugars 
widespread education regarding sugars toxicity should reach from the classroom to our doctors offices 
everyone deserves the chance to break the cycle of sugar addiction

Josh Stockton,why i am a homesteader and why you should be to,"the washington post reported  
the democratic national committee has filed papers in federal court against the republican national committee accusing it of violating a  court order intended to prevent voter intimidation 
the motion filed in new jersey says the rnc has supported the efforts of presidential candidate donald trumps campaign to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the  presidential election trump has recently been urging his supporters to monitor polling places on election day 
democrats arent going to stand by and let trump supporters waltz into polling places in heavily democratic areas to intimidate voters 
trumps call for his supporters to go to polling places that arent their own to watch voters is a clear violation of the consent decree 
the republican party which has completely abandoned the idea of winning elections based on ideas is firmly standing behind their nominee because the same party that was too weak to stop trump during the primary is certainly not going to stand in the way of what might be their only chance of winning 
people should not be afraid to go to the polls and vote no matter who you are voting for democrats have your back the republican party has been trying to suppress the vote and intimidate voters for years

Pamela Geller,clintons most emailed aid in the us state department jake sullivan used personal email to talk with clinton about bringing down libya,"isaac davis 
the months long dakota access keystone xl pipleine protest at the standing rock indian reservation by native americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavyhanded and brutal clamp down by police and national guard militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with lrad sonic weapons attack dogs  tear gas tazers  and even live ammunition  killing horses  while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up 
but as the saying goes water is life  and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement therefore for people concerned with life giving up on this is simply unthinkable the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism and the perception that money is more important than life itself when the police and national guard attack us citizens on private property to protect corporate interests who are they really working for 
the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren ceo of energy transfer partners the company responsible for the project 
so who is kelcy warren 
a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering warren worked in the natural gas industry and became cochair of energy transfer equity in  with business partner ray davis coowner of the texas rangers baseball team warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nations largest pipeline companies which now owns about  miles of pipelines carrying natural gas natural gas liquids refined products and crude oil the companys holdings include sunoco southern union and regency energy partners 
forbes estimates the yearold warrens personal wealth at  billion bloomberg described him as among americas new shale tycoons  but rather than building a fortune by drilling he takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another chilling boiling pressurizing and processing it until its worth more than when it burst from the wellhead  source  
shockingly in  the governor of texas greg abbott appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another  million pipeline project  
according to the governors office the state parks and wildlife commission manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas along with ensuring the future of hunting fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans  source  
this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post his petition is described here  
most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline the dallasbased billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fasttracking a  mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation no environmental impact assessment no respect for cultural sites and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river a similar story is unfolding out in west texas where warrens company has split through the pristine big bend region with the  mile comanche trail pipeline and nearlycomplete  mile trans pecos pipeline these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region 
with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a  year term as  of the  commissioners who preside over texas parks and wildlife why probably the  in campaign contributions abbott received from warren 
footage of militarized police using the long range acoustic device  lrad  crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on october th  final thoughts 
warren is listed as number  on forbes list of wealthiest americans with an estimated net worth of  billion in september of  he is the head of the dakota access pipeline snake 
if you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating gassing and attacking peaceful resistors  including women children and the elderly the answer is they are doing it to protect the interests of kelcy warren and others invested in this pipeline project read more articles by isaac davis

the cbs news republicans hoped that fbi director james comeys letter about new clinton related emails would swing the election for them but a new series of cbs news battleground polls shows clinton keeping her lead and within  points of trump in arizona 
battleground tracker found that by a small margin comeys letter made democrats more likely net  to support clinton 
in the individual battleground states clinton leads by eight points in pennsylvania  north carolina  and in colorado  the only state of the four polled where trump has a small two point lead in arizona  
according to cbs news  and the larger demographic difference defining the race between clinton and donald trump has been a gender gap  slightly larger now than the last time in these states  that offsets a smaller movement of republicans to trump 
to put it another way hillary clintons support with women is going up at a larger rate than republican movement towards trump 
these are the first swing state polls to be taken since fbi director comey released his now infamous letter on friday the email story isnt moving voters it is reinforcing the partisanship of the election democrats are going to vote clinton republicans are going to vote for trump and there arent enough undecided voters to swing the election to trump

as a woman who rejects thirdwave feminism with the burning passion of a thousand suns on a regular basis ive had my fair share of feminists tell me that i only reject them and their ideas because i suffer from internalized misogyny or in other words im a selfloathing sexist 
heres exactly how everyday feminism defines internalized misogyny if youre unfamiliar with bats crazy 
internalized misogyny by definition is sexism turned inward toward ourselves and outward toward other women 
it becomes innate as we are socialized to the norms of our culture that indicate overtly and covertly that women are less than men  less worthy less strong less dependable less able less of a leader less logical  while also more than men more emotional more irrational more complex more to manage 
of course this is ridiculous and i gave such an assertion about as much time as a i would a male feminist hitting on me zero seconds 
but on wednesday i learned that team hillary the political left likewise thought me a selfloathing sexist who passed on my obligation to vote for queen pantsuit because i couldnt stomach the thought of a powerful woman since i apparently believe women are lessers in fact ia woman with a chronic case of internalized misogynycost hillary the election not her decision to engage in potentially criminal activity nor her inability to campaign her way out of a paper bag it was my fault clinton campaign communications director jess_mc on election loss internalized misogyny is a real thing inners httpstcorvtuih  all in wchris hayes allinwithchris november

while trump appears not to understand basic military activities its not clear to me that hes interested in learning them either because there are a number of experts who i thinkwould advise him otherwise but he seems to be confident in his knowledge and that knowledge i think reveals a lot about what he doesnt know 
 
this kind of rhetoric this kind of disrespect for our military leadership this absence of support for our troops who are actually in combat and support for our allies who are fighting and dying every day  it means to me that this individual is not qualified to be commanderinchief

Alex Ansary,fbi releases clinton foundation investigation records,"china airport security robot gives electroshocks  
activist post 
while debate surrounds the threat of autonomous killer robots the mechanized replacement of humans continues across the workforce 
the industrial robotics industry is logging record sales worldwide and there appears to be no sign of a slowdown as you can see in the graphic below  sales surged  over a previous record year to reach almost  million units 
there are many factors driving this growth which you can read about here but one point worth noting is that the two leading countries are the us and china with china leading the way 
the nature of robotics is also changing as new developments in artificial intelligence are giving robots an increasing range of potential uses one key area of course is security robot security guards have already begun appearing at prisons  care facilities  and schools in various locations around the world 
one us robot company gamma  robotics has designed several models for mass production their latest  ramsee  can be seen in the video below a true mass rollout of this fully autonomous security guard could significantly impact the  million humans that are currently employed in some form of security patrol 
ramsee advertises the following capabilities is a physical presence that autonomously patrols without supervision provides realtime data intruders motion heat fire smoke gases  more is a humanmachine interface that creates a powerful force multiplier 
significantly gamma  robotics has partnered with hexagon safety  infrastructure the global leader in public safety and security solutions 
however ramsee is missing one thing weapons for that we have to travel to china where they seem to have embraced police robots full throttle 
in late  i covered an announcement from chinas xinhua news agency where they announced the development and deployment of  weaponized antiterrorism robots that would be far more active than a mere patrol 
the toysized robots can coordinate with each other on the battlefield said the report following their unveiling at the  world robot conference in beijing 
the first model is known as a reconnaissance robot which scouts for poisonous gases dangerous chemicals and explosives before transmitting its findings back to baseif this initial investigation detects a simple bomb is the source of danger the second robot model  a small explosive ordnance disposal eod machine  would be sent in to diffuse it 
but with other more complicated threats an attacker robot would start its mission armed with minorcaliber weapons recoilless rifles and grenade launchers 
with a sighting telescope a trigger and a safe installed the attacker can hit its target from a long distance xinhua said 
the local police force in beijing was reported to be among the buyers for the three robots  which are priced at  million yuan  for the set by manufacturers hit robot group who are based in the northern city of harbin 
apart from antiterror operations they can also be applied in fire fighting public security forestry and agriculture the companys sales manager chen deqiang said according to xinhua 
if we have learned anything about antiterrorism efforts authorities consider frontline deployment to be areas of public travel we were given the tsa based on such notions and have since witnessed its intrusive role in airports and soontobe at other public transportation if authorities have their way 
china has gone to the next level with a robot tsa of sorts called anbot that is equipped with what is essentially a taserlike device that is being fittingly compared to a cattleprod 
image credit 
it was first introduced at a tech show earlier in the year and was speculated to have been designed for protest suppression for now its first job is to patrol chinas shenzhen airport 
most alarming however is that it is tied to one of the most powerful supercomputers on the planet 
the back end of this intelligent security robot is l inked to chinas tianhe supercomputer  where it has access to cloud services  anbot conducts patrols recognizes threats and has multiple cameras that use facial recognition 
these cloud services give the robots petascale processing power  well beyond onboard processing capabilities in the robot the supercomputer connection is there to enhance the intelligent learning capabilities and humanmachine interface of these devices said the uschina economic and security review in a report released tuesday that examines chinas autonomous systems development efforts  emphasis added

this link to cloud services is a new trend in robot artificial intelligence that also has been referred to as the wikipedia for robots  essentially an internet cloud brain through robottorobot information sharing they can speed up their learning process  autonomously examples have included robots that can learn to cook and robots that can learn the tasks involved in caregiving however when applied to policing things become much more ethically troubling 
people were outraged in the us for example when a robot in dallas was used to deliver a pound of c explosive to a us citizen whom the police deemed a sufficient threat worthy of immediate execution at least in that case a human made the decision but it is being viewed as a tiptoe along the path to the widespread use of killer robots much as we have seen with the use of drones discussion was once limited to overseas  egregious enough  but there has been a growing voice of those who are urging weaponized domestic police drones 
as john vibes wrote  it might be inevitable 
the taser corporation is planning on building a drone that is equipped with a stun gun according to a recent report by the wall street journal 
not only will the drones be equipped with tasers but there is also talk of them being autonomous meaning that an actual human wont necessarily be needed to fly the drone 
this is actually already being done in india  the first country to have approved the use of drones attached with nonlethal weapons and just this week british tabloid the sun  had a feature entitled vladimir putins russia is preparing an army of robots and drones to take on its enemies deputy pm dmitry rogozin admits given the available facts this title no longer seems so deliberately sensational 
clearly we are entering a potentially dangerous convergence of expanding robotic artificial intelligence along with the political will to continue allowing robots more and more autonomy as they carry out the traditional duties of the military and police some experts argue that the precision of robotics will curb many of the abuses we have seen from our military and police but is that the trend we are actually seeing or will automated systems of violent control inevitably lead to even greater industriallevel suppression and killing

new york city new york  donald j trump the republican nominee for president has closed the gap with his democratic opponent hillary rodham clinton with just a couple weeks left in the election the latest national breitbart news networkgravis marketing poll shows 
clinton at  percent leads trump at  percent by just one pointinside the surveys  percent margin of error libertarian gary johnson gets just  percent and the green partys dr jill stein just  percent while  percent are unsure the survey was conducted from oct  to oct  sampling  registered voters across the united states the poll was conducted using a combination of interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users 
something has happened since the third debate doug kaplan the managing partner of gravis marketing said of the poll conventional wisdom was after trump said he wouldnt promise to accept the results of the election and made the nasty woman comment many thought hillary would gainbut trump seems to be closing the gap in every election in the last  years this happens where the person behind closes the gap hillary still has a clear electoral advantage and many paths to victory however trump is not out of it but hillary is still the favorite 
this is a big story because it shows trump really closing importantly as the other close polls are showing democratic pollster pat caddell who worked for president jimmy carter and is working with breitbart news and gravis marketing on these polls added he is closing with his favorability and unfavorability as well 
caddell said he thinks obamacares failures where premiums are skyrocketing is one of many reasons why trump is surging among other things that is contributing to trumps rise in the polls caddell said when we are looking down the road at other things that may be influential we are seeing the possibility of again on the immigration issuethat thing about concern on the border seems to be increasing as is opposition to hillary and their plans to expand immigration and refugees which is another big issue but more importantly at the end of the survey we see both candidates have problems on their ability to unite the country and on whether or not they can have the moral leadership to lead theyre basically about the same which i consider a real improvement for trump now that hes that close",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,72.91704389050463,47,9,2562,429,4.925407925407925,429.0,-0.4573785492295443,-0.2020278943791856,-0.1102728218019903,-0.1054197924895727,-0.1615698248138637,-0.0962870467609009,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9623,0.079,0.036,0.885,Positive,Very Strong

Discover The Networks,potentially the worst vp in american history,"obama should just pardon hillary for every conceivable crime november   
dont look now but pardonher talk is growing 
just as the clinton campaign and its media allies rage against the fbi some are looking for a pardon solution and a way to spin that pardon as something other than a straight admission of guilt how about political reconciliation and a way to defy those mean republicans and take the issue of all the crimes that hillary committed off the table here you go 
it does not take much clairvoyance to predict that clintons most strident opponents may seek to extend the use criminal investigations as a political tactic to undermine her presidency if she wins the election next week that prospect triggers a startling idea should president barack obamasimply pardon clinton if she wins the election 
a presidential pardon could short circuit some of this maneuvering the constitution gives the president the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the united states and it could be used here the public is aware of the allegations against clinton yet she has continued to lead in election polls if voters choose her for the presidency their decision that the allegations are not disqualifying deserves respect a presidential pardon could ratify that assessment 
yes but what should obama pardon hillary clinton for corruption bribery abuse of classified information how about everything lets just print up a list of every possible crime and pardon hillary for all of them it would save time energy and raise hillary above the law it would be a clear statement that she could get away with murder

Alex Ansary,bill clinton and hillary lolita express pedophilia ring,"opinion hillary is the whore of babylon and is not human  
tracy twyman 
i put some of this information in an article i published yesterday morning about a larger subject today i have decided to isolate these segments and add more for a comprehensive piece on the subject because other relevant information has emerged 
people in the fbi think hillary clinton is the antichrist  they are close she is the whore of babylon 
hillary was born in  supposedly i looked for this information on a hunch after noticing several clues and sure enough back in  someone on david ickes forum speculated that hillary may have been the moonchild that according to artist marjorie cameron  was implanted into her own womb by rocket scientist occultist and crowley associate jack parsons during a ritual called the  babalon working  the purpose was to birth a child to be an incarnation of what crowley called  babalon  the scarlet whore with the cup of blood foretold in st johns revelation that rides the beast 
cameron actually claimed that this fetus after being taken from her womb was delivered to people involved in the militarys nuclear weapons progranm who were apparently in cahoots with parsons and placed inside of a nuclear bomb that was tested but the fetus survived she said because it had been placed inside of a special canister made exactly for this purpose for the  trinity bomb test they made a special canister called jumbo that was supposed to to preserve the plutonium if the bomb did failed to go off they reportedly didnt end up using it for that but it has been suggested that this is what preserved the fetus of the moonchild presumably it grew up to be somebody 
crowley named one of his female consorts who he always called his scarlet women hilarion her name was jeanne foster crowleys attempt to conceive an heir as a magical child with hilarion resulted supposedly in the childs spirit being attached to his protege charles stanfield jones back in  the attachment allegedly occurred when jones went through the ritual for crossing the abyss in the th degree of the oto which involves being ritually sodomized by everyone in the group 
jack parsons another person who had willingly subjected himself to this ritual channeled the book of the antichrist in  where he foretold 
and within seven years of this time babalon the scarlet woman hilarion will manifest among ye and bring this my work to its fruition 
i also believe that hillary with her notorious cracking voice and possibly her rival trump were foretold in another document channeled by parsons the book of babalon  
her voice is sure as the judgement trump to crack the house of wrong though walls are high and stone is hard and the rule of hell was long the gates shall fall and the irons break in the birth of babalon 
in rome the hilaria was a festival to the goddess cybele worshipped in the form of a black meteorite stone to celebrate the resurrection of her son who as the legend states she had been having sex with she then became jealous of his love of others castrated him and let him die of bleeding the reason why all of her priests the galli were castrated and actually considered women she later regretted this and caused him to be brought back to life then forced everyone under her rule to celebrate by laughing and partying joyously as commemorated in this festival consider this next time you notice hillary clinton laughing inappropriately 
also note that hillary clinton has made several selfdepricating jokes about herself being  not even human  and shortcircuiting when she gets herself twisted up in her own lies specifically in october  when her interviewer at buzzfeed noted that she seemed to not be sweating even though it was a hot day odd because hillary has notoriously bad bo she asked hillary what kind of deodorant she used clintons reply was astounding

this fall the us agreed to provide  billion in military aid to israel over the next ten years ensuring americas continued role in funding the occupation of palestine meanwhile my friends and colleagues here in gaza live in fear of another significant israeli attack in the near future 
they have every reason to fear another major escalation  violence is a daily reality in gaza in two recent incidents a rocket was fired from gaza into israel without causing damage or injuries and in both instances israel responded by bombing targets throughout gaza 
in august alone israel bombed more than  locations in the small territory  
the simple story told about these events focuses on action and reaction palestinians attacked israel with a rocket and israel responded we hear this logic after nearly every event of this sort but its woefully incomplete 
in both instances the rockets fired werent fired by hamas but rather by small radical armed groups at odds with hamas which governs gaza these groups seek to incite israeli attacks on hamas with the goal of destabilizing its control over gaza because they see hamas as too comfortable with the status quo 
since seizing power in  hamas has worked to control and limit violence from the territory outside of periods of defined military escalation  which tend to be precipitated by israeli attacks  they have effectively stopped attacks against israel from gaza 
this explains why as noted by the israeli press there were only  rockets fired from gaza towards israel between january and august this year none were fired by hamas so israels decision to target hamas as a response makes no sense 
of course  rockets fired from gaza is  too many for those of us committed to ending all violence and none of this should be taken as an apology for other violence perpetrated by hamas 
but as the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in the occupied palestinian territories reports  there were also  israeli military incursions into gaza this year resulting in  palestinian deaths and on average injuring five palestinians in gaza every week 
this is the part of the story that isnt told 
gaza also remains under an israeliimposed blockade that severely limits travel trade and life for gazans despite assurances that restrictions would be lifted in the  hamasisrael ceasefire agreement the blockade remains in effect 
israel with support from the us government claims this decadeslong blockade is in place to pressure the people of gaza to rise up against hamas and provide security for israelis 
if those are israels raisons detre then its a complete failure it hasnt stopped violence it hasnt weakened hamas and it hasnt brought israelis or palestinians security 
while the blockade hasnt succeeded in achieving the changes israel claims to be seeking its impact on the civilian population of gaza has been immense 
over two years after the end of the last large military operation there much of gaza remains in ruins 
of the  palestinians in gaza who were displaced during the  israeli bombardment over  remain homeless as  percent of the homes seriously damaged or destroyed havent been rebuilt this is largely because reconstruction materials remain blocked from entering gaza 
this important context is too often missing as us pundits and politicians consider the situation in gaza 
given the blockade and regular military incursions imposed by israel the firing of less than  rockets per month by palestinians cannot be seen as the core reason for violence 
if the us is serious about promoting peace between israelis and palestinians preventing future violence in gaza and guaranteeing security then it must recognize the violence inherent in the israeli occupation and end the blockade 
the next attack on gaza feared by my friends who live there is an inevitable reality if nothing changes

ahtribune.com,isis executes  civilians by electrocution in central mosul,"abdullah muhammad almuhaysini a senior al qaedalinked cleric and the religious leader of jeish alfatah terrorist group admitted that the militants in syria have received financial and military aid from saudi arabia and certain other persian gulf arab states  shares
   
according to the syrian dissidents news website enab muhaysini has released a video recently in which he appreciated riyadh and other arab states for equipping his comrades with missiles
the saudi preacher said that the missiles that they have sent would be used to break the syrian army and its allies siege of aleppo
he also thanked turkey for supporting the terrorists and treating the wounded militants in its hospitals
jaish alfatah is a conglomerate of terrorist groups with alnusra fatah alsham front comprising its main body
in relevant remarks in june a source said that saudi arabia has sent new cargoes of weapons and financial aid to the terrorists in aleppo in northern syria to strengthen them against the syrian army and its allies fresh attacks
more why do we only hear of the humanitarian crisis in aleppo and not everywhere else in syria is maintaining assad the least worst option the criminal wests state sponsorship of terrorism israel wants syria destroyed as presaged by the oded yinon plan the saudi regime has recently sent small arms and new equipment including  drones to the terrorists in syria the source said
to this end riyadh has sent one of its ranking officers to the regions controlled by terrorists in northern aleppo to supply them with money and arms to intensify attacks and open new fronts against the syrian army and popular forces the source added
also a prominent syrian military analyst said earlier this month that the terrorists in aleppo take orders from outside and dont dare to leave the city in anticipation of punishment by saudi arabia and turkey
violation of the ceasefire by the terrorists and their opposition to the evacuation of aleppo is of no surprise as they are not the ones in charge of the decisionmaking for remaining or leaving the city rather they take orders from the regional and international sides for whom they are working turki hassan told fna last saturday

Daniel Greenfield,project veritas ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago,"realism about the jihad threat in oklahoma oklahoma state rep john bennett ventures where few dare to tread october   robert spencer 
in an age of nearuniversal denial and willful ignorance at the highest levels about the ideological roots nature and magnitude of the jihad threat it is as unusual as it is refreshing to find lawmakers at any level who are willing to approach the problem honestly state representative john bennett of oklahoma a marine and combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan  is one of an alltoorare breed 
on tuesday bennett held an interim study on the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america in his request to hold this study he explained this will be a study of the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america 
this kind of study should have been held not just in the oklahoma house of representatives but in the us house and senate as well that such an idea is inconceivable is an indication of the fix were in and the situation is only marginally better in oklahoma nowadays the misinformation and disinformation about what were up against is so universal that anywhere the truth is told about this threat there is significant pushback from the allies and enablers of jihad and islamic supremacism 
and so it was in tulsa on tuesday the interim study featured testimony by former fbi agent john guandolo and chris gaubatz whose exploits as an undercover agent infiltrating the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair are chronicled in the eyeopening book muslim mafia  
gaubatz and guandolo presented evidence including land records showing that the islamic society of greater oklahoma city isgoc is owned by the muslim brotherhood group the north american islamic trust nait that both cair which has an active chapter in oklahoma city and isgoc are muslim brotherhood organizations and that cair has extensive ties to the jihad terror group hamas which styles itself the muslim brotherhood for palestine they pointed out that since imad enchassi the imam of isgoc is a palestinian and has all these ties to the muslim brotherhood he likely also has links to hamas 
guandolo and gaubatz did not base their case on innuendo and hearsay they laid out fbi evidence muslim brotherhood documents and more demonstrating that the claims they were making were based on solid evidence 
predictably however the mainstream media which we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt is simply and solely a propaganda arm for the left and the democratic party  focused entirely on the presence of adam soltani of cairok and enchassi the tulsa world ran a piece with the hysterical headline state representative brands cairok its director and a local imam as terrorists it quoted soltani raging against bennett rep bennett is shamefully wasting taxpayer money to promote his own biased agenda this hearing was a new low for rep bennett as his guests presented a biased narrative that achieves nothing more than demonizing and marginalizing the oklahoma muslim community 
the world magisterially told its readers that cair is a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group working to enhance the understanding of islam it didnt see fit to mention that cair is an unindicted coconspirator in a hamas terror funding case  so named by the justice department there was not a word in the world report about how cair officials have repeatedly refused to denounce hamas and hizballah as terrorist groups several former cair officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror  cairs cofounder and longtime board chairman omar ahmad as well as its chief spokesman ibrahim hooper have made islamic supremacist statements  ahmad denies this but the original reporter stands by her story  a california chapter distributed a poster telling muslims not to talk to the fbi and a florida chapter distributed pamphlets with the same message  cair has opposed virtually every antiterror measure that has been proposed or implemented and has been declared a terror organization by the united arab emirates 
but the tulsa world and other mainstream media outlets that covered bennetts study did not see fit to inform their readers of any of that instead predictably enough they portrayed the hearing as a baseless exercise in racebaiting and fearmongering conducted by a politician up for reelection 
john bennett and the people of oklahoma deserve better there are legitimate questions about cair and isgoc bennett dared to raise them tuesday for that he is being subjected to a media lynching that is cynically designed to obscure the genuine concerns he raised  yet ever since a member of isgoc beheaded a coworker in  these concerns are more urgent than ever 
the media enablers of jihad must be decisively repudiated please email the speaker of the oklahoma house jeff w hickman politely and courteously expressing your support for john bennett and requesting that his hearing be just the first of a series his email is email protected and his phone number is

Corbett,interview   new world next week with james evan pilato,"in climate change  by nadia prupis  november   the researchers say  percent of core ecological processes on land and sea have been affected by climate change in a way that has not been expected for decades photo lwp kommunikációflickrcc 
climate change is already affecting life on earth despite a global temperature increase of just c according to a new study published in the journal science on friday 
nearly every ecosystem on the planet is being altered and plants and animals are being so affected that scientists may soon be forced to intervene to create humanassisted evolution the study titled the broad footprint of climate change from genes to biomes to people  found 
the researchers say  percent of core ecological processes on land and sea have been affected by climate change in a way that had not been expected for decades 
coauthor and professor john pandolfi of the university of queensland said  temperature extremes are causing evolutionary adaption in many species changing them genetically and physically these responses include changes in tolerances to high temperatures shifts in sexratios reduced body size and migration of species 
understanding the extent to which these goods and services have been impacted allows humans to plan and adapt to changing ecosystem conditions he said 
dr james watson associate professor of planning and environmental management at uqs school of geography added we are simply astonished at the level of change we observed which many of us in the scientific community did not expect to see for decades 
the changes have manifested in some species shifting to higher or lower ground as the planet heats up while others are becoming smaller as a higher surfaceareatobodymass ratio makes it easier to stay cool the independent reported  the outlet wrote 
for example six species of woodland salamander in the appalachian mountains have undergone an average eight per cent reduction in body size over the past  years 
slightly smaller lizards might not sound like something to overly concern humans but there is evidence this response is also affecting important sources of food 
these multilevel biological impacts of climate change will affect humans increasing disease outbreaks inconsistent crop yields and reduced fisheries productivity all threaten our food security said coauthor dr tom bridge 
average global temperatures have risen c since the industrial era the study states that this has already had broad and worrying impacts on natural systems with accumulating consequences for people minimizing the impacts of climate change on core ecological processes must now be a key policy priority for all nations 
the study called on governments to follow through on the promises made in the paris climate agreement  which aims to keep global warming below a c thresholdalthough an increasing amount of scientists are sounding the alarm that even those pledges may be too little too late 
time is running out for a globally synchronized response to climate change that integrates adequate protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services the study continued 
it is no longer sensible to consider this as a concern for the futureif we dont act quickly to curb emissions it is likely that every ecosystem across earth will fundamentally change in our lifetimes said dr watson this work is licensed under a creative commons attributionshare alike  license share this",corbettreport.com,Fake,english,14.592450262994053,10.703235802372705,54,9,3423,541,5.280961182994455,541.0,-0.2433532738279656,-0.2020278943791856,0.1175233856532761,0.0701604559975727,0.1893263710842895,0.0833981990605279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9226,0.063,0.041,0.896,Positive,Very Strong

Daniel Greenfield,obamas secret muslim list,"search form search from bad to worse  obamas ransom payment to iran is just the tip of the iceberg in his bid to pursue a legacy obama charts disastrous course with reckless abandon november   ari lieberman 
most of us including several democratic lawmakers cringed when obama inked the iran deal but those of us who are familiar with the malevolent nature of the iranian regime recoiled in horror when we learned that obama transferred  million to the iranians in exchange for four american citizens held captive by the mullahs on trumped up charges the  million was part of a larger installment totaling  billion ostensibly to settle claims iran had against the united states stemming from aborted iranian arms purchases dating back to the shah obama claimed that this was money that was owed to iran and the settlement which included  billion in interest saved the us taxpayer billions because the iranians were demanding even more at the hague tribunal where the claim was being adjudicated 
the timing and method of the cash transfers were disquieting to say the least and raised serious questions of legality as well as broader geopolitical concerns the americans were freed only after iran received its  million the payment which was airlifted in the dead of night in an unmarked cargo plane was made in untraceable cash stacked on wooden pallets the iranians demanded swiss francs and euros rather than dollars and a pliant obama agreed to the islamic republics dictates gleeful iranian leaders were quick to announce victory and claimed that the payment was indeed a ransom contradicting the administrations adamant denials 
even within the administration there was confusion about whether the payment was in fact a ransom state department spokesman mark toner came very close to acknowledging this fact when he noted that the  million was used as leverage to ensure the americans safe return the white house however quickly repudiated the state departments characterization 
even if one were to believe the story peddled by the administration the mere appearance of a quid pro quo payment potentially exposes the us to extortion and hostagetaking the iranians certainly believed it was a ransom payment and more likely than not every twobit dictator on the planet saw it that way as well 
but there are deeper more troubling aspects to this convoluted story in his january   address to the american people obama tried to put a positive spin on his dealings with the islamic republic but as noted by rick richman in an excellent article featured in mosaic  the deal struck with the iranians was rotten to its core and the administration deliberately kept the american people in the dark about various aspects of the shady arrangement 
the  million that the us transferred to iran came from irans foreign military sales fms account with the pentagon the balance of  billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since  but obama neglected to note that when iran filed its lawsuit the us filed counterclaim against iran for  million for iranian breaches of its obligations under the fms program the us could have conceivably won that counterclaim which would have meant wooden pallets of cash for the american treasury courtesy of the islamic republic 
moreover american plaintiffs maintained sixteen us court judgments against the islamic republic stemming from that regimes involvement in terrorist activities those judgments totaled  billion in compensatory and punitive damages 
some plaintiffs sought to recover their judgments directly from irans fms account but their efforts were stymied by the clinton administration instead under a convoluted deal struck between congress and the clinton administration in  the us treasury was to pay the holders of the judgments against iran for the amount of their compensatory damages and  percent of their punitive damages up to the amount in the fms fund the judgments would then be subrogated to the united states which meant that judgments became direct us claims against the iranian government 
iran ignored the judgments and never paid any of the plaintiffs under us law the  million sitting in the fms account should have gone back to the us treasury which had already paid the judgment holders but the us treasury never collected a dime on the subrogated claims since obama shipped the money off on wooden pallets to iran essentially the us taxpayer ended up footing the bill for irans terrorism while the iranians were never held accountable for their maleficence 
obamas actions represented blatant disregard for the law for the victims of terrorism and for the american taxpayer his claim of saving the taxpayer billions represents the zenith of mendacity 
obama claimed that the payments had to be made in cash because existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures but as noted by richman the sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made to settle iranian claims instituted at the hague exposing yet another lie by the obama administration 
there was one and only one reason why the iranians requested cash and all but the most disingenuous know what that reason is the iranians are the worlds foremost statesponsors of international terrorism they finance terrorist groups and proxy militias throughout the region and internationally but can only do so through illicit means that circumvent normal methods of financing hence they demanded untraceable cash the misery that we are currently witnessing in syria yemen and elsewhere is due in no small part to the obama administration which provided the iranians with the cash necessary to keep operations flowing 
in addition to the  billion in cash obama also authorized the release of seven convicted iranian felons and expunged warrants on  others but this aspect of the transaction seems almost trivial when considering the sheer mendacity and illegality of nearly every other aspect of the deal 
lastly the transfer of such a large sum to iran in settlement of an alleged legal claim required the attorney generals approval but the administration has yet to produce any document bearing loretta lynchs signature authorizing such payment on october  sen marco rubio r fla and rep mike pompeo r kan presented lynch with a series of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the deal lynch whose tenure as attorney general is proving to be as corrupt and partisan as her predecessor has inexplicably refused to answer the lawmakers queries 
in a desperate attempt to establish a legacy obama pursued the iran deal with reckless abandon forfeiting positions previously regarded as red lines and signing the worst deal in us diplomatic history the ancillary deal struck with the iranians concerning american hostages was laced with outright lies and enabled the iranians to continue their reign or regional terror more importantly it may also have been in violation of existing us law and lynchs stonewalling only lends credence to that notion",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,25,4,6985,1124,5.181494661921708,1124.0,-1.130029414777363,-1.141531470845462,1.0599276724775029,0.9841183566047677,0.0911626695320512,1.0187240768631445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.9981,0.065,0.131,0.804,Negative,Very Strong

 twist dont pull heads up pulling an apple can inadvertently knock down other fruit and risks damaging the tree better to carefully twist the apple upwards than be consigned to the punishment orchards sea of wet beige trees with no end in sight keep this rule in mind and you will never get trapped in the pitchblack sap oozing out of all the trees nor will you be driven mad by the winds that constantly whisper a summary of dale earnhardts death 
 dont waste fruit the stench of bleach and pennies will be the surefire sign that your decision to just toss imperfect apples onto the ground of the normal orchard has landed you in the wicked seething grove of the punishment orchard a chorus of middleaged men shrouded by crude scarecrow masks will taunt you with their vexing rhyme we are the men who have picked before  your hands are bags your days no more looking down condemned travelers will realize the infectious verse has replaced their hands with reusable grocery bags and they can no longer remember important birthdays 
 dont eat the apples until youve paid youll want to pay upfront if you dont want to wake up in the wicker prison at the base of the tree of despair a beige monstrosity whose sprawling tendrils lie directly under the approach path of the regional airport you must sit in your atonement basket while the depraved orphaned children of the punishment orchard throw scalding apples at your head as part of one of their simpleminded religious rituals

republican presidential candidate donald trump signaled thursday plans to seek nationwide changes to school curricula with the goal of promoting american pride and patriotism in americas schools 
in a trump administration i plan to work directly with the american legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to americas children trump said speaking at the american legions annual convention in cincinnati 
we want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of americas history its institutions and its heroes many of whom are with us today he told the veterans group 
the comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools which is prohibited under federal lawwe will stop apologizing for america and we will start celebrating america we will be united by our common culture values and principles becoming one american nation one country under one constitution saluting one american flag and always saluting it trump said 
last year a denverarea school board sought to change the content of the ap us history course because some board members thought it failed to promote patriotism 
that sparked a political proxy war in jefferson county colorado and the  school board election drew nearly  million in campaign funding from outside interest groups 
public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money most schools receive little federal funding

Rejean Paquette,no title,"election crossroads socialism or capitalism exclusive jane chastain explains impact of dems living wage proposal published  mins ago jane chastain about   archive jane chastain is a southern californiabased broadcaster author and political commentator despite her present emphasis on politics jane always will be remembered as the nations first female tv sportscaster spending  years on the sports beat jane blogs at janechastaincom she is a pilot who lives on a private runway print 
our country is at a crossroads never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road one road the one favored by politician hillary clinton and her democratic colleagues promises to lead us to a socialist utopia the other favored by businessman donald trump and some of his republican colleagues promises to get us back on the road toward freemarket capitalism 
it is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system in this system they control the lions share of our money and in turn hand out favors in this system they make the major decisions that affect our lives as the government accumulates more and more power we invariably end up with less statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power the more of our hardearned money he or she spends yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again expecting a different result 
weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the freemarket system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world no it isnt perfect but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life 
notice what i didnt say is simply willing to work hard there is the belief by some that if you simply work hard you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs which is around  a year in some parts of the country the democrats want to replace the minimum wage which is a training wage with this living wage that completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently 
ideally it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does 
unfortunately this socalled living wage will destroy jobs it will cause companies to automate and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate 
but this living wage is only part of what the democrats want to do in the name of fairness 
this no doubt appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better 
wages have remained flat for far too long but the democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators 
most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes they are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices and when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high such as weve seen in obamacare there is a large outcry thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services thats when the door to socialismcommunism slams shut 
they tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear our benevolent government will take care of us they are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve and if we dont get that job the government is going to give us free health care free food and free housing under president hillary there will be free child care free preschool and paid family leave what a country 
if we dont reach our goals everything will be ok because social security and medicare will be there to finance our retirement and if that isnt enough the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television 
what about the fact that social security and medicare are going broke how long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses they never talk about that 
as british prime minister margaret thatcher once said the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money 
dont be fooled this election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket its an important fork in the road one fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom the other offers a free lunch

with protests erupting across the country this week and emotions running high american companies are trying to make sense of how to react to a trump presidential election win but one major company has clearly made up its mind and just came down squarely in the antitrump camp in a big way donald trump will be added to disneys hall of presidents but his animatronic figure will be able to feel pain 
wow disney just showed that it does not pull punches when it comes to what the company believes in check out the press release they put out this morning 
disney prides itself on promoting inclusivity empathy and nonviolence which are values that mr trumps presidency threatens thats why when we eventually add him to our hall of presidents exhibit in disney worlds magic kingdom his mechanical replica will bear the capacity to suffer horribly and without limit being a company that caters to diverse families we felt it was a moral responsibility to have mr trumps robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death this is the best way for us to uphold the hall of presidents tradition while also voicing our vigorous objection to the trump administration 
given that disneys software makes the animatronic believe its bones are shattering each time it moves or speaks this company clearly wants people to know its not onboard the trump train 
park visitors who feel similarly opposed to trumps presidency can rest assured that his hall of presidents double will be designed to experience anxiety so its always aware that more pain is coming although the machine will understand what joy is its programming will never allow it to feel that 
and disneys not letting trump off the hook there the replicas for abraham lincoln and george washington will even be reprogrammed to slap scratch and pry the fingernails off the animatronic trump which will respond to such painful stimuli by gasping crying screaming vomiting or a mix of all of these 
if that doesnt send a powerful statement about where disney stands politically we dont know what does

Luke Stranahan,things i learned from being my own general contractor,"why donald trump must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money by   th  
if donald trump truly wants to fix the economy he must shut down the federal reserve if he just tries to patch up our current system he will fail because it has been fundamentally flawed from the very beginning a little over a century ago very powerful forces on wall street convinced congress to completely restructure our financial system an immensely powerful central bank known as the federal reserve was created and the goal was to transform the us dollar into a debtbased currency that would continuously be inflated and to create an endless debt spiral from which   could never possibly escape sadly they were successful on both counts since the creation of the federal reserve the value of the us dollar has declined by approximately  percent and our national debt has gotten more than  times larger  
americans tend to give most of the credit or most of the blame for the performance of the us economy to our presidents but the truth is that an unelected unaccountable group of central bankers has far more power over our economy than anyone else does the federal reserve has become known as  the fourth branch of government  but unlike the other branches of government we are told that the feds decisions are above politics because they are too important fed officials fiercely guard their independence and they fiercely resist any interference from congress the president or the american people 
donald trump can try to lower taxes and reduce regulations but what he will be able to do to influence the economy pales in comparison to the immensely powerful tools that the fed wields the fed controls interest rates the fed controls the money supply and the fed regulates the banks 
to give you an idea of how enormously powerful the fed is i want you to pull out a dollar bill 
as you look at that dollar bill i want you to notice that it says federal reserve note right at the top 
in the financial world a note is an instrument of debt and the truth is that our system was designed to create as much debt as possible 
so why are we using debtbased federal reserve notes in the first place shouldnt congress have control over our currency 
according to article i section  of the us constitution  it is congress that has the authority to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures 
so how did the fed get involved 
well it is a very long and convoluted story and if you are interested in the history behind it i would commend to you an excellent book by c edward griffin entitled  the creature from jekyll island a second look at the federal reserve  basically big money interests on wall street got their hooks into the white house and congress and they rushed through legislation right before christmas in  that created this insidious central banking system that was designed to slowly but surely take wealth from the american people and put it into their hands 
sadly most americans dont even realize that we have a debtbased currency nor do they understand where our money comes from in a previous article  i discussed how money is normally created by the federal reserve under our current system 
when the us government decides that it wants to spend another billion dollars that it does not have it does not print up a billion dollars 
rather the us government creates a bunch of us treasury bonds debt and takes them over to the federal reserve 
the federal reserve creates a billion dollars out of thin air and exchanges them for the us treasury bonds 
the federal reserve takes the us treasury bonds that it receives in exchange for the federal reserve notes that it gave to the government and it auctions off those bonds to the highest bidder  but of course this process always creates more debt than it does money 
the us treasury bonds that the federal reserve receives in exchange for the money it has created out of nothing are auctioned off through the federal reserve system 
but wait 
there is a problem 
because the us government must pay interest on the treasury bonds the amount of debt that has been created by this transaction is greater than the amount of money that has been created 
so where will the us government get the money to pay that debt 
well the theory is that we can get money to circulate through the economy really really fast and tax it at a high enough rate that the government will be able to collect enough taxes to pay the debt 
but that never actually happens does it 
and the creators of the federal reserve understood this as well they understood that the us government would not have enough money to both run the government and service the national debt they knew that the us government would have to keep borrowing even more money in an attempt to keep up with the game 
so our debt just keeps going up and up and up while barack obama has been in the white house our national debt has risen by more than  trillion dollars and at this moment it is sitting just under the  trillion dollar mark  
but we shouldnt be surprised by this because this is precisely what the federal reserve system was designed to do to us 
many conservatives still hold to the mistaken illusion that we could somehow pay all of this debt back someday but as i have shown in a previous article this is mathematically impossible to do  
if the government went out today and grabbed every single dollar in existence we could not pay back the national debt and of course we have   of household debt   of corporate debt and   of state and local government debt that we need to pay back as well 
under the current system our only hope is to keep the wheel spinning by continuing to devalue the dollar and by continuing to go into even greater amounts of debt 
and of course it isnt just the united states that is in this predicament at this point almost every single nation on the entire planet has a central bank 
even though there are extremely sharp disagreements among nations on virtually everything else somehow central banking has achieved nearly universal adoption 
as you read this article well over  of the population of the globe lives in a country that has a central bank 
do you think that is just a coincidence 
of course there are still a few very small countries such as the federated states of micronesia that do not have a central bank but the only big nation not to have one is north korea 
and you would literally have to be insane to want to live in north korea 
but now we have an opportunity to get free from this insidious system the truth is that we dont have to have a central bank in fact the greatest period of economic growth in us history was when there was no central bank  
we dont need central planners to set our interest rates and to manipulate our money supply they will never admit this but the reality of the matter is that their interference in the economy often creates tremendous economic busts 
since the federal reserve was created in  there have been  distinct recessions or depressions                    
considering their track record isnt it time for a change 
and we dont have to have a debtbased currency in fact not too long ago we had a president that decided to start issuing debtfree united states notes 
back in  president john f kennedy issued executive order  which authorized the us treasury to issue debtfree united states notes which were directly created by the us government 
he was assassinated shortly thereafter 
most americans dont realize this but many of the debtfree united states notes that were issued under president kennedy are still in circulation today  and president trump could do something similar 
but will he 
it has been said that the borrower is the servant of the lender and the federal reserve system has turned all of us into debt slaves 
debt is a form of social control and the global elite use all of this debt to dominate the planet the total amount of debt in the world just hit   of  trillion dollars  and the longer we allow the central banks to control the system the bigger this debt bubble will become 
  here in the united states that starts with shutting   issuing debtfree currency it would take someone very bold to make a move like this and so let us hope that the man that we just elected is up to the task",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,85.16960871803,53,9,8391,1491,4.556673373574782,1491.0,-0.2739283131710483,-0.2020278943791856,1.4319154398202494,1.5594572065581818,-0.5254746654353056,1.6075141234387191,0.0006706908115358,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0010127944001298,0.9946,0.115,0.079,0.806,Positive,Very Strong
Alex Ansary,trump breaks from stump speech to admire beautiful trump mask,"kremlin nato was created for agression  
russia today reports of the new reinforcement of nato troops close to russias borders show the aggressive character of the organization the kremlin has said commenting on recently announced preparations to deter an alleged russian threat 
the western military alliance was established  not for peacebuilding but exactly for aggressive actions  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said on monday despite the fact that blocs which opposed nato no longer exist its impossible to change the alliances  aggressive nature  due to its ideological and political bases 
earlier on monday the times published a report suggesting that  hundreds of thousands of nato troops will be put on a higher state of alert amid growing tensions with russia  according to the british daily  which cites the alliances secretarygeneral jens stoltenberg and the uks outgoing permanent representative to the bloc adam thomson  nato aims to largely speed up the time its troops can be deployed 
it reportedly aims to have up to  military personnel from nations across the alliance at the ready having shortened their response time to about two months compared to the current  days

the handout read oh allah how perfect you are and praise be to you blessed is your name and exalted is your majesty there is no god but you 
it had been given to the girl during a lesson in ethics at the bavarian school

heres another story from yesterday in rt  
parents of a german teenager may face a trial and fine for truancy after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his indoctrination by islamic radicals 
the story broke in midjune when parents of a yearold student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern german town of rendsburg reportedly organized as part of a geography class 
in a letter to the class teacher quoted by the ndr the teens father argued that his son would be indoctrinated in the mosque he went on to say that for years we have been hearing reports about religiouslymotivated violence connected with islamic people

David G. Brown,if you dress like an attention whore at work expect to be treated like one,"what would you do if you saw two boys of  years wrestling their shirts off red and sweaty they have a large group of peers around them cheering eyes wide and knuckles white would you stop them or give the young scraps some advice do you see a violent squabble or boys acting on natural impulses which will better equip them to defend their family and neighbours later in life the answer you give is in large part dependent on your gender so the fact that this scenario would make an increasingly large number of men upset is a sign of a collapsing civilization but nil desperandum  western civilization has the solution
mere horseplay
as an early years professional i saw education academics acknowledging the databoys need rough and tumble play for their mental and physical wellbeing but they have no way of encouraging this in institutions where boys are immediately reprimanded for making fingerpistols at each other without saying it directly they thought that the majority female teaching staff for younger age ranges were pushing our boys natural urge to fight like lioncubs underground whats more the boys were made to feel bad about themselves and their very nature
their solution they suggested that more men be encouraged to teach younger children and engage in rough play with them until the late s education was male dominated and boys spent a lot of time with male mentors but of course there has been no effort to bring back that environment instead a compromise between boys being boys and boys being fairy princesses was achievedplaying superheroes
as though female teachers are going to tone down the disapproval as the boys shoot lasers and magic at each other the treacherous political class present only feeble attempts to manage the symptoms of our societal masculinity problem like sticking some tape over the burst pipe of our hemorrhaging testosterone as cultural marxism continues to swing the pickaxe of nthwave feminism at it so its high time we took a few swings back
but first we need to teach our lads how to fight at the age of  or  viking children were taught the martial art of glima this was not just father and son playfighting boys and occasionally girls already wrestle with friends and family up to that age this was more systematic a group activity
the greeks also taught their boys how to wrestle because our other ancestors could see the big picture the hoplites for example were individualistic free men of all ages who voluntarily came together to practise combat this not only strengthened their communities but also allowed these farmers to fend off the persian empire yet today even isolated expressions of violence in computer games are questioned by sjws nevertheless all the signs are thereour boys are yearning for the same activities practised by their forefathers

at college i started a unofficial fight clubmen only this based in large part on the book and movie of the same name in which the narrators nietzschean alter ego tyler durden describes the bubbling frustration inside the everincreasing number of somethings coming together for underground fights were a generation of men raised by women naturally half the guys in my year were participating within a week but our young boys should be taught how to fight openly and without shame to avoid hidden expressions of violence and maybe even some massshootings by angry loner teens when they are young it is the perfect time to teach them
young lads have no intention of seriously injurying their friends its just good fun and produces healthier attitudes towards violence and confidence in selfdefence and the defence of ones community furthermore a recent study has shown that fighting helps to strengthen peer relationships meaning less bullying and segregation it is interesting to compare the codes of honour of ancient greek wrestling etc with those we intuit as wrestling children
no intentional hitting or kicking no gouging the eyes or biting no going for the balls thats precisely how i used to wrestle with my brothers and friends as a pup it was just obvious if someone took things too far they were ostracised from the fun at least until they calmed down and apologised if someone got hurt we stopped checked whether they were just being a pussy or needed to get themselves mended we kept calm and carried on
were a generation of men raised by women  tyler durden
the data are screaming that men havent changed especially our need to practise fighting we still have the same natural impulses but their suppression no their demonisation has made our men weak and submissive so much so many are selfdeprecating betas who believe masculinity is toxic full of white guilt and ashamed of western civilization we have everything to be proud of and need to encourage our boys fighting spirit so they grow some balls some confidence in themselves and their kin thats the spirit which has kept our enemies foreign and domestic at bay for thousands of years and will do the same to cultural marxism malevolent immigrants and anyone else who wants to have a go if we want to turn scrapping boys into men first and gentlemen second we need to organise some fights not break them up

the palestine football association pfa in a first testing of palestines ability to fight its battle with israel in international courts plans to go to the worlds top court for sports in a bid to force its israeli counterpart to view israeli settlements on the west bank as occupied territory rather than an extension of the jewish state
the potential palestinian move follows the palestinian authoritys campaign to isolate israel in international organizations and challenge israels occupation of the west bank in the international criminal court icc
using soccer as a testing ground palestines efforts to confront israel in international organizations has produced mixed results while palestine succeeded in joining various international organizations the pfa last year failed to muster sufficient votes to persuade world soccer body fifa to suspend israel the pfa argued that the policies of the israeli government and the israel football association ifa violated fifa rules as well as international law governing the status of occupied territory
the pfa has since been unable to push fifa towards any punitive steps against israel instead fifa opted to monitor developments and attempt with little success to negotiate a way out of the impasse palestine is expected to take legal recourse if fifa fails to take more decisive action at its next council meeting in january
the pfas focus since failing to get israel suspended has been on banning six clubs that are based in israeli settlements on the west bank from playing in israeli lower divisions fifa rules stipulate that clubs based in a recognized federations territory cannot play in leagues of another soccer association without the permission of the home federation the pfa rejects the notion of granting permission because it believes that it would legitimize israeli settlements and the occupation
more swedish soccer player sent off for loud fart during match pfa president jibril rajoub suggested that the pfa would take its case to the court of arbitration for sport cas after a sevenhour meeting earlier this month of a fifa committee headed by tokyo sexwale failed to resolve the issue
mr sexwale is scheduled to visit israel later this month for a meeting with israeli sports minister miri regev the fifa council is scheduled to discuss the issue at its next meeting in january the pfa is likely to prepare its case for cas but wait with filing it until after the january meeting
israel sees the palestinian demands and threat as strengthening the growing boycott divestment and sanctions movement bds that sees penalization as a means of forcing the jewish state to alter its policies and ultimately withdraw from territory occupied during the  middle east war
condemnation of the israeli occupation and settlements by the united nations security council constitutes the legal basis for the pfas approach as well as potential challenges in international courts
the strength of the palestinian position has been weakened changing persian gulf attitudes towards israel and saudi and united arab emirates pressure on palestine authority president mahmoud abbas persian gulf states despite paying lip service to the palestinian cause have become more public about their informal relations with israel based on common opposition to expanding iranian influence in the region
writing in the kingdoms controlled press a prominent saudi journalist went as far as calling for the establishment of diplomatic relations with israel the uae last year agreed to the opening of an israeli diplomatic mission accredited to the abu dhabibased international renewable energy agency rather than the uae government bahrain as part of an agreement to host next years fifa congress has consented to issue visas to representatives of the ifa israeli nationals are barred from travelling to persian gulf countries
at the same time saudi arabia and the uae have been pressuring mr abbas to resolve his differences with mohammed dahlan the controversial former abu dhabibased gaza strongman who is an archenemy of the palestinian president mr dahlan is widely seen as a successor to year old mr abbas who would be acceptable to israel
israel may be able to count on some degree of tacit persian gulf support within fifa but is likely nonetheless to ultimately have to be seen to be accepting some kind of compromise that throws a bone to the palestinians
the palestinians focus on the israeli west bank teams has however raised the bar for israel an agreement between prime minister benyamin netanyahu and former fifa president sepp blatter struck last year addresses many of the pfas grievances but not the issue of six the west bank teams their status goes to the heart of the palestinianisraeli conflict the legal status of territory occupied by israel since 
under the agreement mr netanyahu proposed to give palestinian players special identity cards and place sports liaison officials at crossings between palestinian areas and those under israeli control in a bid to eliminate obstacles to free movement that complicated the development of palestinian soccer mr netanyahu further suggested to create an escort service that would facilitate players travel between the west bank and gaza that are separated by israeli territory
israel initially appeared to live up to its promises by granting for the first time in  years a west bank team hebrons al ahli passage to gaza to play a palestine cup final against the strips al shejaia hopes that this signalled a new beginning were however dashed when the pfa cancelled the return match in hebron after israel agreed to grant passage to only  of the  players who were scheduled to travel implementation of the agreement has since evaporated
the pfa by putting the west bank teams at the top of their agenda has made it tougher for fifa and israel to work out a compromise that would not have implications for the future of israelipalestinian peace making israeli is likely to want to avoid subjecting its policies to the scrutiny of an international court yet that may be exactly what would best serve the palestine authoritys overall strategy",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,7.981665512530776,65,10,6150,996,5.1656626506024095,996.0,0.0929721589459437,-0.0141271790859303,0.8390103284297126,0.7834552154766012,0.0755380270155739,0.8133695102100827,0.001004016064257,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0024869142688746,0.9947,0.121,0.073,0.806,Positive,Very Strong

Alex Ansary,janet reno first female us attorney general dies at,"las vegas may become the new amsterdam  
high times 
nevada already has legal brothels roundtheclock casinos and a coy catchphrase declaring that what happens in vegas stays in vegas if voters approve the state could soon add another vice in the form of recreational marijuana 
a proposal on the nov  state ballot would legalize pot and entrepreneurs hope its passage could someday allow the drug at las vegas glamorous nightclubs and perhaps provide the framework for a future amsterdamstyle cannabis district 
i really think this would be the thirdlargest market in the country said derek peterson whose company operates medical marijuana dispensaries called blum he predicts that only california and new york would offer a bigger customer base than las vegas and its  million tourists a year i think it should be able to fit in really well with the whole dayclubnightclub thing 
nevada has allowed medical marijuana since  and peterson sees recreational pot as an alternative for visitors tired of cocktails that can top  apiece and inflict hangovers but before waitresses begin delivering highgrade marijuana at clubs along the las vegas strip weed proponents will have to win over not just voters who narrowly support the initiative in polls but a riskaverse casino industry 
the nevada resort association came out against the measure pointing to an opinion from gambling regulators that casino owners should avoid the marijuana industry because the substance remains illegal under federal law las vegas sands owner sheldon adelson has bankrolled most of the opposition pouring  million of his fortune into a campaign that raises the possibility that small children could become intoxicated from candylike marijuana edibles 
adelson also has contributed  million in arizona and massachusetts a significant share of all antimarijuana donations there 
adelson whose son died of a drug overdose and whose wife is a doctor specializing in drug addiction has donated millions toward efforts to defeat medical marijuana proposals in florida and other states in years past 
other casino operators have joined the fray but to a lesser extent 
in spite of its libertine reputation the rigorously regulated casino industry is known to err on the conservative side to avoid scandalizing the middleaged tourists who are its bread and butter 
i dont know that this is a game changer in terms of tourism virginia valentine president of the nevada resort association said of marijuanas potential were really known for other things you may attract people or turn them off 
the las vegas convention and visitors authority which promotes sin citys amenities to the world is neutral on the issue 
clyde barrow a gambling expert who chairs the political science department at the university of texasrio grande valley suggests the donations may indicate the casino companies are acting in their own best interests 
the marijuana industry is emerging as another form of recreation and entertainment given the casino industrys difficulties attracting millennials marijuana is probably perceived as a direct competitor with casinos for entertainment dollars he said another reason is that legalized marijuana competes with alcohol and to that extent competes with the food and beverage sales at casinos 
theres no solid statesponsored research on how legal recreational marijuana has affected tourism in places that have legalized it although both sides point to colorado to make their case 
promarijuana interests cite a state study that found colorado set an alltime tourism record in  capping a fifth year of growth its unclear how much of that is due to weed and how much can be chalked up to other factors such as good snow in recent years relative to competing ski states 
marijuana opponents refer to a report from the visit denver tourism bureau that logged increasing complaints about panhandling and open marijuana consumption in the citys downtown corridor 
denver is losing visitors and valuable convention business as a result of these overall safety or perception of safety issues the report said we fear not being able to brand denver away from this growing reputation 
nevadas ballot initiative would not allow municipalities to put blanket bans on marijuana as colorado does but it would bar consumption in buildings that are open to the public and permit local governments to restrict the locations of marijuana dispensaries and related businesses it effectively blocks people from growing their own by banning the practice within  miles of a licensed marijuana store",amtvmedia.com,Fake,english,16.496481406625215,12.22722258602208,51,9,4566,722,5.286703601108033,722.0,-0.3350783918572136,-0.2020278943791856,0.4199288039127066,0.3539106789991204,0.1949935745997033,0.3737823909683728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9683,0.111,0.077,0.812,Positive,Very Strong

one of the most important questions is will us democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton rig the election to win the white house like she did in the primaries against bernie sanders asks myles hoenig an american political analyst and activist 
recent polls show that clintons national lead over trump is shrinking as the election day is approaching 
the former secretary of state has the support of  percent of likely voters while the billionaire businessman has  percent support according to the cnnorc survey released on monday 
libertarian candidate gary johnson has  percent support among likely voters while green party nominee jill stein has  percent support 
in every election the race tightens towards the end hoenig told press tv on thursday 
its really hard to imagine that there is any flux in this election as the supporters of both sides absolutely hate the other with obama and romney or even gore and bush many of the issues were shared and the voting was often done on personalities or the historical nature of a first black president regardless of who was pulling whose strings he said 
this election is more polarized than ever with the podesta leaks showing clintons overt racism calling donna brazille a buffalo as well as proving that president obama lied to the public about when he learned of clintons inappropriate use of her emails and with the news of trumps access hollywood tape receding into americas short term memory span its no wonder the polls are tightening the analyst stated 
the question of the day is will clinton rig the election like she did the primary being the only way she could have won he asked 
were also seeing both johnsons and steins numbers dropping but so many are not polled that those numbers are harder to verify the commentator noted

No Author,unhinged trump supporter holds children at gunpoint over damaged trump sign video,"on november    pm  
trying to catch the liar of liars in a lie isnt hard getting him and his campaign to acknowledge that trump is the liar of liars is same thing with bullying but the new york times put together a spread of all the bullyish things trump has said and tweeted and to whom now the toronto star s daniel dale has been tracking trumps lies for just six weeks and the paper has compiled a complete list of those lies which you can find here  
there are literally hundreds of lies in trumps speeches theyre not all  unique but this is probably the final and ultimate proof that trump will say anything to smear anyone including his enemies while keeping his supporters happy 
is there any presidential candidate in history that has lied this much tons of people claim hillary is a master liar but first shes actually more honest than most politicians second even if she could be considered anything like a master liar she still could not compete with trump the liar in any way shape or form 
the star put the lies into a whopping  categories clintons policies wtf daeshmiddle east clintons record african americansinner cities the clintons corruption rigged election tradeeconomy health care trumps endorsements refugeesimmigration polls obamas record the campaign russia trumps record taxes sex assault allegations clintons health and government corruption 
they also compiled a list of the top  types of lies trump has told and gave more detailed analysis beginning with the electoral system is rigged of course its rigged against him 
after plummeting in the polls after the first two debates trump began to repeatedly question the fairness of the election rigged became his catchword 
he claimed hillary clinton campaign workers hired thugs to cause violence at his rallies twisting the evidence from an undercover video to unfairly disparage clinton he claimed there was widespread voter fraud in philadelphia chicago and st louis  cities with large black populations that heavily favour democrats 
in greeley colo trump told his supporters if they dont trust mailin ballots they should vote again in person so one did trump supporter terri lynn rote a yearold from iowa was charged by police for suspicion of voting twice 
nobodys committing voter suppression and fraud quite like trumpsters and republicans 
another is muslims are risky this touches on his assertions that we know nothing about refugees coming from syria who could be the great trojan horse of our time 
his claims that syrian refugees   per cent are muslim  are terrorists plays to the fears of the other even though they are extensively vetted and are predominantly women and children and their numbers is nowhere near trumps claims  about  have been admitted to the united states in  
the polls favour trump har de har har  trump only looks at the polls he likes and theyre usually unscientific online polls or other dubious polls very few of the established scientific polls favor him nevertheless 
it seems clear trump manipulates exaggerates or makes up polls that make it sound as if he is doing better than he actually is this poll denialism gives his supporters licence to dismiss negative polling data suggests cnn 
his false claims cast doubt on the legitimacy of mainstream polling  and perhaps even the vote itself if supporters feel trump should be doing better then the idea of a rigged election seems more credible 
on oct  he said i won the last two debates and every poll showed it in fact every scientific poll showed that he lost 
of course when unscientific online polls came out in his favour trump was quick to promote  and exaggerate  those numbers 
but these are just a few of his biggest most repeated lies he has also falsely said on twitter the failing nytimes reporters dont even call us anymore they just write whatever they want to write making up sources along the way falsely said by open borders hillary means totally unlimited immigration falsely said hillarys plan includes an open border with the middle east falsely called nbc anchor lester holt the moderator of the first debate a democrat falsely said wow just came out on secret tape that crooked hillary wants to take in as many syrians as possible falsely said the us provided iran  billion as part of the nuclear deal falsely said in san bernardino many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed  and wounded many many peoplemuslims have to report the problems when they see them falsely asserted that clinton has been fighting isis her entire adult life falsely said all together the hillary clinton plan would bring in  refugees in her first term falsely claimed he had been acknowledged to be correct in declaring nato obsolete because it doesnt cover terror falsely suggested nato created an antiterror position because of his comments falsely claimed clinton didnt release cholesterol or ekg information falsely said sexual assault allegations against him have been largely debunked falsely said apparently of sexual assault accuser summer zervos the one young lady has five family members saying what she said is absolute nonsense falsely said i did not i did not to clintons charge that he thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese falsely said i was against going into iraq and its so welldocumented falsely said our taxes are so high just about the highest in the world 
and so many more just in the last six weeks yes many of them are repeats but lies are lies if trump sees this hell likely throw a livid fit about it and claim that the papers lying and continue to sell the myth that hes not the liar of liars being caught in a squillion lies

donald trumps campaign has ended fundraising events meant to support the republican partys getoutthevote efforts in next months elections 
aides to the republican nominee told fox news that trump victory the joint fundraising committee for the gop and the campaign held its most recent fundraiser on oct  and no more such events were scheduled 
the move which was first reported by the washington post cuts off a key money source for republicans hoping to keep hold of both houses of congress 
weve kind of wound down trump national finance chairman steven mnuchin told the post but the online fundraising continues to be strong 
by contrast the post reported that democrat hillary clintons campaign has scheduled  fundraising events between now and nov  the former secretary of state was scheduled to make her last personal fundraising appearance tuesday in miami 
mnuchin told the paper that the real estate mogul was focusing on making his final pitch to the voters at a campaign events rather than raising money in the final two weeks of the race 
we have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political events mnuchin said of the candidate unlike hillary who has been fundraising and not out and about he has constantly been out and about 
according to the post the republican national committee had collected  million through trump victory as of sept  
rnc spokeswoman lindsay walters said the organization continues to fundraise for the entire gop ticket 
meanwhile politico reported tuesday that the senate leadership fund a super pac with ties to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky was putting  million into seven senate races deemed crucial in determining the balance of power on capitol hill",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,47,7,1761,285,5.12280701754386,285.0,-0.4573785492295443,-0.5778293249656962,-0.3221947290861581,-0.3311658262587598,0.0332437200666561,-0.3273109342455951,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9072,0.046,0.011,0.943,Positive,Very Strong
admin,college warns against deplorable and problematic costumes,"at the third debate donald trump was asked if he would accept the results of the election trump responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it the media went berserk claiming that trump was undermining democracy but is the us system really rigged and if it is can trump overcome it
why rig the system the elite realize that their time is short
woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time revelation 
it is human nature to want to accumulate wealth it is also human nature to want to keep what you have one of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them a democratic republic is particularly easy to influence the wealthy elite can buy candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs they can make voting patterns more favorable to them by changing the countrys demographics or they can influence voters through the supposedly unbiased news media that they control in the us the wealthy elite use every one of these levers to rig the system
for example liberal voters often favor a progressive tax system where high earners pay greater percentages than those who earn less it sounds like a populist policy but it is not progressive taxation is put in place to prevent middle class people from rising into the ranks of the truly wealthy who have already accumulated their wealth and are taxed at the much lower capital gains rate progressive taxation keeps the rich on top and keeps the plebs down thats why no matter which political party is in power we are still stuck with progressive taxation
everything goes well as long as both parties dont rock the boat but once you get a true wildcard like trump the system must spring into action to stop the threat to the established order thats what we are seeing now the elite are using every tool in the arsenal of the rigged system to ensure trump does not upset their gravy train the elite sense their time is short
voter fraud 
the first way in which the election is rigged is through voter fraud in his gettysburg address trump outlined some of the ways in which this occurs
according to pew there are  million voter registrations that in the us that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate  million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting i wonder how that happens  million people are registered to vote in more than one state these are numbers folks these are numbers  of noncitizens are registered to vote
liberals always object to any sort of voter identification requirement they say that it negatively affects minority voters who may not have any identification but this is obvious nonsense the real reason liberals oppose voter identification is because it would make voter fraud more difficult
by raising concerns about voter fraud trump is firing a warning shot he is saying that he will fight voter fraud unlike prior gop candidates who preferred defeat to calling out cheating by the other side simply putting the democrats on notice may cause them to cheat less than they would have otherwise the only question is whether trump will be able to muster enough votes to overcome the amount of cheating that will take place
the lügenpresse 
a second way that the system is rigged is through the legacy news media these include the three oldest television news networks abc cbs nbc as well as the newer ones cnn msnbc fox it also includes the remaining newspapers especially the new york times washington post and the wall street journal of these the only ones that are reliably conservative are fox and the wsj both of which are owned by rupert murdock but even here it is more accurate to call fox and the wsj neoliberal rather than conservative as they both push the globalist message of open borders and unenforced trade
trump is very media savvy hes been in the public eye since the s and his philosophy has been that no publicity is bad publicity trump has used this to highlight his policies by making controversial statements he has been able to force the media to cover his positions still the nonstop smear campaign has hurt trumps numbers particularly among older voters who still get their news from legacy sources
new media outlets like return of kings breitbart and danger  play have been more favorable to trump but the most highly funded new media such as daily beast heat street buzzfeed and huffington post all push the globalist message the end result that trump is fighting an ocean of disinformation with only a handful of allies by his side
voter discouragement fivethirtyeight doing its best to discourage trump voters
another way that that system is rigged is that the legacy media conspires to discourage trump voters from going to the polls one way they do this is to over poll democrats to make it look like trump is losing for example one recent poll placed hillary  points higher than trump but even obama was only able to beat mccain by  points even though he was packing stadiums of  people and hillary doesnt command the sort of adulation that obama did in 
there is a huge motivation gap between trump and clinton recently trump held a rally in tampa where  people showed up some of these people waited in line for  hours for the chance to see trump a day later hillary hosted a rally in florida where only  people showed up and some of those were likely paid plants her running mate tim kaine did even worse barely getting  people to show up for one of his events
one day before the brexit vote polls showed remain leading by  points leave ended up winning by  points
why does the legacy media report polls that show trump losing by a landslide because it is designed to dishearten trump voters
conclusion will trump be able to overcome the rigged system it will be a heroic achievement if he does one thing is certain this is not the time to give up but to fight with all of our might the elites want us to be discouraged to give up hope to lie down and die that is the one thing we will never do even if the host of hell rise up to oppose you go to the ballot box on november th regardless of what you may hear otherwise your life will be very different under president trump than it will be under globalist pawn hillary
win or lose our battle to bring back the patriarchy will not end on november  th  a trump victory would give us breathing room to start restoring our society in the open a hillary victory heaven forbid would signal that our work will need to be underground either way our battle is just beginning in future columns i will outline the way forward for traditional men

if donald trump wants to keep arizona in the republican column he will have to spend some of his very limited time money and resources there because hillary clinton is campaigning in the red state next week 
the clinton announced that the democratic nominee would be spending part of the last week of the campaign in arizona on wednesday november   hillary clinton will campaign in phoenix arizona days before election day clinton will lay out what is at stake in the election with more people voting in this election than any in history clinton will urge arizona voters to take advantage of inperson early voting voters can check their registration status and early vote location at iwillvotecom 
the fact that clinton will be in usually reliably red arizona in november during the final week of the presidential campaign tells voters all they need to know about the state of the presidential race 
hillary clinton is in such a good position that she can afford to spend some time during the last week of the campaign trying to turn red states blue 
the trump campaign already deployed vp nominee mike pence to utah in a bid to save that dark red state from falling and it looks like they will have to devote resources to saving arizona to prevent clinton from winning a state that has been a given for republicans in previous elections 
the trump campaign is broke the nominee had to give his campaign  million so that they could afford to buy air time in battleground states for their ads

EdJenner,clinton emails use arab female agitators to shame israel," stupid things voxcoms matthew yglesias has said by aaron bandler october   
matt yglesias of vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder given his penchant for saying things that are mindbogglingly asinine apparently yglesias agrees with this sentiment matt yglesias deleted something like  tweets yesterday clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations 
fortunately the internet is forever and all of the stupid things that yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly 
here are  things yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb 
 yglesias was convinced that people would love obamacare that is until he didnt  mattyglesias obamacare marker  which was solid as of  minutes ago  appears to no longer be markering pictwittercomaeyximig  omri ceren cerenomri october   
his  piece is still available though and in it he whines about how supposedly the media for nonideological reasons is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that when obamacare becomes the status quo people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten 
in other words yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking that all fell by the wayside when the obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of  percent 
 yglesias made a racist comment toward former louisiana gov bobby jindal r in a  tweet that is now deleted yglesias wrote is bobby jindals reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping 
yglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash tweeting oh fun conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode 
eventually yglesias backed down tweeting for the record now that i know more about jindals life its clear that hes a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff 
the irony of yglesias saying this was not lost on twitter good thing you dont say dumb stuff mt mattyglesias its clear that jindals a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff  jon gabriel exjon june   
 yglesias once ranted against dumb jewish politicians the leftist pundit wrote a thinkprogress piece in  that was seriously titled dumb jewish politicians in which yglesias highlighted a passage from jonathan chait who wrote in the new republic that thensen joe lieberman ict had to be stupid for not supporting the public option 
i suspect that lieberman is the beneficiary or possibly the victim of a cultural stereotype that jews are smart and good with numbers chait wrote trust me its not true if senator smith from idaho was angering democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes most liberals would deride him as an idiot with lieberman we all suspect its part of a plan i think he just has no idea what hes talking about and doesnt care to learn 
yglesias agreed 
ive long held a related theory about eric cantor 
anyways this reminds me that at a meeting this morning i pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret christmas morning session that only jewish senators would attend theres a whole bunch??boxer cardin feingold feinstein franken kohl lautenberg levin lieberman sanders schumer specter and wyden its a very progressive bunch and lieberman could easily be outvoted 
 yglesias advocated for ending time zones seriously in what was a typical example of vox being a waste of space yglesias wrote a  piece titled the case against time zones theyre impractical  outdated yglesias pontificated 
northern idaho is connected via i to spokane and seattle to its west but not to boise to its south so the couer dalene area is on pacific time rather than mountain time india has broken with the general scheme and adopted a halfhour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time 
yet while these zigzags and minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time they serve a very practical purpose it is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings calls and other arrangements across time zones the need to constantly specify which time zone youre talking about is a drag commuting across time zones would be more annoying still which is why the suburbs of chicago that are located in indiana use illinois central time rather than indianapolis eastern time 
but the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations its to shift the world to one giant time zone 
ygleasias then called for one time to rule them alla phrase that prompted jrr tolkien to weep in his graveand then wrote this doozy 
if the whole world used a single gmtbased time schedules would still vary in general most people would sleep when its dark out and work when its light out so at  most of london would be at home or in bed and most of los angeles would be at the office but of course londons bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in la would be grabbing a nap the difference from today is that if you were putting together a londonla conference call at  thered be only one possible interpretation of the proposal a flight that leaves new york at  and lands in paris at  is a sixhour flight with no need to keep track of time zones if your appointment is in el paso at  you dont need to remember that its in a different time zone than the rest of texas 
pejman yousefzadeh explained just how stupid yglesiass time zone piece was writing at ricochet  i grant you that there are times when confusion does take place but seriously who cares is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that matthew yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them dont the people at vox have anything better to write about 
apparently they dont 
 yglesias doesnt understand floridas geography very well yglesias wrote a short blurb in the atlantic in  in which he began thinking aloud about the city of miami 
id been interested to know what if anything is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know yglesias said 
people immediately pointed the obvious answer miami couldnt do so because there was this thing called a swampmost of which is the everglades national parkcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish 
yes yes commenters i know its a freaking swamp but theres plenty of development on exswampland in florida  hence all the canals and weirdlooking lakes an exasperated yglesias wrote in an update 
except that the land is not exswampland its an actual swamp  maybe yglesias shouldnt write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud 
 yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fineif youre a politician yglesias found himself getting smacked around on twitter after he advocated for highspeed rail advocates to provide an unrealistically optimistic projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government 
for better or for worse thats politics yglesias wrote at thinkprogress  
on twitter yglesias attempted to justify it by writing fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do yes 
and yet yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist eli lake of being dishonest on twitter 
yglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a catch when he told the daily caller to go f yourself when they tried to interview him about the twitter incident 
 yglesias once hailed the department of veteran affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate the federalist s sean davis pointed to yglesias writing in  that the va was producing the highest quality care in the country their turnaround points the way toward solving americas healthcare crisis yglesias also tweeted at gop chairman reince priebus in  will reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans this tweet was also deleted and for good reason since the va has caused  veteran deaths due to systemic problems with the agency 
 yglesias doesnt understand the purpose of the senate yglesias wrote the following for thinkprogress in  per the guardian  
if you add together the two republican senators from wyoming with the one from alaska one from south dakota one from new hampshire two from maine two from idaho two from nebraska one from nevada two from utah two from kansas two from mississippi one from iowa two from oklahoma two from kentucky one from louisiana two from south carolina and two from alabama the  of them collectively represent on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator  percent of the american population meanwhile barbara boxer and dianne feinstein together represent  percent of the american population 
now of course texas is also a big state though at  percent of the population its a lot smaller than california and there are small states like vermont and north dakota that have two democratic senators so the point here isnt a narrowly partisan one though the wacky apportionment of the senate does have a partisan valence the point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things if you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population we have just  senators representing the aboveaverage states even though they collectively contain  percent of the population the other  senators represent about  percent of the people if the iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them 
in three paragraphs of rambling incoherent nonsense yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations 
 yglesias doesnt understand americas financial system yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a  slate column that there were far far far too many banks in the country as there were  at the time yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous 
 they are poorly managed you know how the best and brightest of wall street royally screw up sometimes this doesnt get better when you drill down to the lessbright and notasgood guys it gets worse and since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from fdicensured depositors nobody is watching the store in effect the wellmanaged banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones the dubious decisionmaking doesnt get as complicated as what you see on wall streetits mostly just classic boomandbust procyclical commercial real estate loansbut it creates all the same problems  they cant be regulated since these banks are so small they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs so since american public policy is perversely committed to preserving them small banks regularly get various kinds of carveouts from regulations and once the carveouts exist they create pressure for extension further up the food chain other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation  they cant compete if you want the jpmorgan chases and bank of americas of the world to be held to account you need both regulation and competition but a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesnt offer any real competition having a large share of americas banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize bigtime finance 
davis debunked yglesiass argument which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there havent been any new banks formed in recent years there were at least four in  
yglesias arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anticommunity bank talking points promoted by the big banks you guys the wall street banks that nearly destroyed america arent the problem small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem dont worry about the facts just go with it davis wrote in the federalist  im actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation 
 yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon after reading a review of a booker t washington biography yglesias started thinking about black conservative political tradition prompting him to write in a  thinkprogress post its only extremely recently that the idea of an africanamerican aligning himself à la clarence thomas with the mainstream conservative movement in america could be remotely possible but even so that didnt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didnt exist 
this is patently false as damon root explained in reason  
actually the great harlem renaissance author and journalist george schuylerwho was known as the black hl menckenpublished general rightist sentiments long before clarence thomas came on the scene including schuylers unambiguously titled  autobiography black and conservative and the celebrated novelist and folklorist zora neale hurston both endorsed conservative sen robert a taft in the  presidential election and repeatedly attacked fdrs new deal 
 yglesias expressed joy when andrew breitbart died following breitbarts death yglesias tweeted  conventions around dead people are ridiculous the world outlook is slightly improved with andrewbrietbart sic dead 
this tweet has also been deleted and for good reasoncelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid its ghoulish vile and reprehensible and slate defended yglesias stating that he is a very passionate journalist and slate values that passion 
apparently slate believes that passion trumps basic human decency and a reasonable iq level and yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities",dailywire.com,Real,english,99.09687615386632,93.82490884357614,56,9,14041,2313,5.018150388936906,1156.5,-0.1822031951418003,-0.2020278943791856,2.9267453725987114,2.8480908159906244,-0.0700421086246153,1.070864884802398,0.0030263726761781,0.0,0.0008646779074794,0,3,0.0,0.0057628482090013,-0.9965,0.083,0.108,0.808,Negative,Very Strong

most people think of costco as the place that sells bulk quantities of pretty much everything but the warehouse superstore is now making headlines for a very different reason and it could serve to tarnish their brand the blue angels accidentally flew into the costco in augusta ga and are currently stuck flying around inside the discount retailer 
worst of all it doesnt seem like costco has any idea how to get the airplane stunt squadron to leave 
the blue angels were performing at a routine air show in augusta ga earlier today when they veered too close to the costco and zipped through the automatic doors as they slid open for a customer before costco employees could react the diamond formation of five fa hornets had entered the store and began performing deathdefying aerial feats right over the shelves of bulk cereals and jumbosize ketchups 
customers are trying to ignore the roaring jets overhead but its hard to concentrate on your shopping list when sonic booms keep knocking over pallets of kirklandbrand dog food its usually a welcome treat to see the blue angels conduct synchronized barrel rolls but inside costco the elite pilots are proving to be a serious nuisance 
so far all attempts to evict the blue angels have proved unsuccessful at first costco staff just propped the front door open with a bucket assuming the blue angels would find their way back out eventually after an hour when choreographed smoke trails continued to plague the store the manager grabbed a lacrosse stick from a sporting goods display and tried to shoo the planes toward the exit unfortunately that only caused the blue angels to accelerate to  mph and perform several looptheloops in the freezer aisle where the pilots hit a truly exhilarating  gs 
your heart just has to break for this poor manager 
with the store set to close in only a few hours costco better think up a solution fast or blue angels will be locked in overnight if that happens then tomorrows customers will be aggravated by more of the same worldclass aeronautic showmanship what an absolute hassle",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,56,10,2100,359,4.8245125348189415,359.0,-0.1822031951418003,-0.0141271790859303,-0.2325049331194504,-0.2151574477940386,-0.2611436804484635,-0.2085903253992939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.8341,0.073,0.098,0.83,Negative,Very Strong

two years ago john fitzpatrick got the most devastating phone call of his life when he learned that his brother robert had died of a heart attack in his sleep john instantly thought of roberts yearold daughter sophie who was just starting to forge her path in life thats when this amazing uncle decided to step up in a seriously inspiring way with robert no longer there for her john took it upon himself to discourage his nieces art career 
okay is someone cutting onions in here because were getting just a little bit teary 
ever since his brothers passing john has made it a point to call his niece every single sunday evening to remind sophie just how much her father loved her how proud hed be if he could see her now and how unstable a career in the arts can be compared to more traditional ninetofive employment sophies true passion in life has always been drawing and painting but thanks to her selfless uncles constant reminders that almost nobody actually ends up working their dream job shes now just two years away from getting her ba in marketing 
i want sophie to know that she can always depend on me john explained gazing tearfully at an old photograph of robert holding his baby girl but she cannot depend on freelance income especially in a field as oversaturated and undervalued as the arts shes way too smart for that 
john has never faltered in his commitment to making sure his niece understands just how unrealistic it is to earn a living as an artist last summer when sophie landed an internship at a brooklyn art gallery john spent countless hours reminding her that new york is expensive dangerous and very far away from ohio before ultimately finding her a job doing administrative work for his friend instead and when sophie briefly considered getting a double major in studio art her uncle pulled out all the stops even going so far as to gain control of her late fathers finances so that he could temporarily withhold the semesters tuition check until she changed her mind 
incredible is there an uncle of the year award because this guy definitely just won it 
while nobody can ever take the place of sophies father it is seriously heartwarming to see john step up to the plate like this sophie is so lucky to have an uncle she can always turn to for love guidance and stacks of brochures for mba programs handed to her at every family holiday heres to you john",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,90,17,2486,448,4.533482142857143,448.0,0.8573481425230105,1.3011778279668569,-0.130380268685382,-0.0756338574783605,-0.5483621357745004,-0.0658047282733371,0.0089285714285714,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0156410624187048,0.9953,0.151,0.051,0.798,Positive,Very Strong

 geoff garin geoffgarin october   
it is still early but if this were the election shifting news that republicans were hoping for the impact would have been immediate the reality is that if the public opinion polls tighten in the final days of the campaign it will be because republicans are coming back to trump 
there are few undecided voters in this election and even if all the republican base come home to trump it wont be enough for trump to win because he is losing where the presidential election is really held trump is getting crushed at the state level 
republicans have been trying to build hillary clintons emails into a story for years and they have failed at every turn

Relampago Furioso,will there be riots in america the day after donald trump wins the presidency," ways to forge strength through challenges  ways to forge strength through challenges 
corey is an aspiring iconoclast he believes that the key to life is for men to honour their primal nature 
learn more about his views at theprimalmalecom you can also follow him on twitter  november   mind 
we modern men need to constantly improve ourselves in a hostile world like ours that tries to debase us while the lesser men embrace weakness and degeneracy we must embrace strength and discipline while whiners complain about how unfair the world is and how its better to just disengage we must engage the world with greater willpower and defeat our enemies towards this end i propose that we become both resilient and antifragile in every way possible 
the following are ways you can turn a seemingly negative circumstances into strengths  stress 
although stress has been maligned as the plague of the modern world that wrecks our mental and physical health the way you perceive it makes a profound difference on how it affects you new studies have shown that those who see stress as being toxic suffered damaging health effects while who saw it as being helpful were able to turn it into a source of energy to push them through their challenges 
so next time you feel stressed from whatever trouble you may be facing remember that it is your friend you must reframe the sensation and believe that its your body trying to help you by changing how you processes stress you can use it to succeed in life  obstacles your response to obstacles reveal the kind of man you really are 
whatever obstacles you may face in your endeavors you have two choices become frustrated and discouraged by it or see it as an opportunity to grow stronger like stress its the weaker mans inclination to view an obstacle as a confirmation of his own helplessness but you must do better and face up to whatever gets in your way use every occasion to grow stronger from your obstacles and if you arent facing enough of them in your life you need to get out and start doing more things 
how you deal with obstacle will show your true nature as a man for the world to see so dont pussy out or moan about what you must overcome instead be determined to rise above it your honor is at stake  failures 
failures are inevitable in life although you should always try your best to succeed you shouldnt be afraid to fail either just as with obstacles view every instance of failure as an opportunity to learn and adapt its not failure itself that is bad but not learning from it or giving up so easily remember winners dont quit they try to do better  rejection 
rejection is a specific kind of failure that is often the most painful of them all its especially difficult because its often unclear whether it was actually your fault or not i would say that its best to assume full responsibility for all the rejections you face and see what area you can improve to better increase your chance next time as long as youre willing to learn and as long as youre willing to try again you will grow master rejections and youll be placing yourself far above other men  physical discomfort this is why russians are so tough 
its well known that the human body is designed to be antifragile your bones get thicker with every blow and your skin gets tougher with every scrap pain and discomfort of all sorts also become more bearable the more you expose yourself to them the more harshness you endure the stronger you become over time but inversely the more comfortable you are the softer you turn and the weaker you get 
one simple method you can implement to become more healthy and energized is to start taking cold showers the benefits of doing it are many including stronger immune system enhanced mood and energy better circulation boost in testosterone level and so on if you are having trouble getting started start by doing just  seconds at the end of your usual warm shower and go from there you want to train yourself until you can comfortably stand under the coldest water for at least five minutes  fear 
you cant really turn fear itself into a positive but the process of conquering your fears can have a transformative effect on your life some of the proudest most exciting and memorable moments of my life were when i defied fears by doing a presentation in front of hundreds of people i had a terrible stagefright going rock climbing i have a terrible fear of heights and traveling for the first time by myself to a foreign country 
one thing you can do to completely turn your life around is to do what this man did and make a list of all the fears that you wish to defeat write them down in an order from the least fearful to the most and start knocking them down one by one its impossible not to become a better man once you conquer them all  anger 
like fear anger is not something you can transform into a positive trait ive heard of people transmutating their anger to rechannel the energy into other activities but ive never had it work that way however it is a good focal point to master your mind to become more stoic it can also serve as your area of focus if you practice meditation 
no matter how unpleasant your anger will teach you a lot about yourself and only if you allow it it will reveal your weaknesses insecurities and any other areas of your life in need of improvement as one of the most base and primal of human emotions you shouldnt just shirk it as something that is unneeded instead make it your friend  negativity and pessimism 
for the longest time i felt guilty about being so negative because i was constantly told by everyone else that it was a bad thing smile they said think positively they said your life will improve they said i was constantly berated for not being part of the north american positivity cult its no wonder why people there tend to say that theyre doing great even when theyre feeling like shit a habit i have yet to fix 
but in contrary to the long held belief that positive thinking and attitude gives you a better life studies have shown just the opposite forced positivity can actually harm you  for some people like me positive thinking backfires and makes things worse also badtempered people who are pessimists have been shown to enjoy more successful marriages be healthier live longer be better at negotiating and more successful overall in life so if youre a natural grouch like me its time to embrace who you are and tell the fakeass positivity people to shove it conclusion 
the road to selfimprovement is an ugly and a bumpy one i honestly cant say that i enjoy it but no matter what i know that it is a necessary part of being a man i cant imagine myself not trying to be better in spite of all the difficulties i refuse to live a life of complacency some people mock and insult our efforts  but know that their opinions dont matter lesser men have no say on what it means to live so fight on and prosper for this is your one and only life",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,85.16960871803,77,14,6975,1265,4.48695652173913,1265.0,0.4598726310629357,0.7374756820870908,1.05728195578232,1.2051613480037633,-0.5942783610199868,1.2449349666919072,0.000790513833992,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0012647724776828,-0.4062,0.185,0.184,0.631,Negative,Moderate

Henry Wolff,japans population declines in  for first time since,"facebook lets advertisers exclude users by race julia angwin and terry parris jr pro publica october   
imagine if during the jim crow era a newspaper offered advertisers the option of placing ads only in copies that went to white readers 
thats basically what facebook is doing nowadays 
the ubiquitous social network not only allows advertisers to target users by their interests or background it also gives advertisers the ability to exclude specific groups it calls ethnic affinities ads that exclude people based on race gender and other sensitive factors are prohibited by federal law in housing and employment 
snip 
the ad we purchased was targeted to facebook members who were house hunting and excluded anyone with an affinity for africanamerican asianamerican or hispanic people  heres the ad itself  
when we showed facebooks racial exclusion options to a prominent civil rights lawyer john relman  he gasped and said this is horrifying this is massively illegal this is about as blatant a violation of the federal fair housing act as one can find 
the fair housing act of  makes it illegal to make print or publish or cause to be made printed or published any notice statement or advertisement with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference limitation or discrimination based on race color religion sex handicap familial status or national origin violators can face tens of thousands of dollars in fines  
the civil rights act of  also prohibits the printing or publication of notices or advertisements indicating prohibited preference limitation specification or discrimination in employment recruitment 
snip 
facebook says its policies prohibit advertisers from using the targeting options for discrimination harassment disparagement or predatory advertising practices 
we take a strong stand against advertisers misusing our platform our policies prohibit using our targeting options to discriminate and they require compliance with the law said steve satterfield privacy and public policy manager at facebook we take prompt enforcement action when we determine that ads violate our policies 
snip 
he said facebook began offering the ethnic affinity categories within the past two years as part of a multicultural advertising effort 
satterfield added that the ethnic affinity is not the same as racewhich facebook does not ask its members about facebook assigns members an ethnic affinity based on pages and posts they have liked or engaged with on facebook 
when we asked why ethnic affinity was included in the demographics category of its adtargeting tool if its not a representation of demographics facebook responded that it plans to move ethnic affinity to another section 
facebook declined to answer questions about why our housing ad excluding minority groups was approved  minutes after we placed the order

 chimps will betray their own to get their hands on italian food as with all chimps the ones i studied in gombe were absolutely obsessed with italian food and would go to extraordinary lengths to get their hands on some one day the troops alpha male whom i called goliath managed to acquire a plate of linguine humphrey a younger male saw goliaths linguine and became incredibly jealous he offered to give goliath his most prized possessiona vacant hornet nest that he enjoyed having sex within exchange for the linguine but goliath declined as he already had a hornet nest of his own desperate to eat the linguine humphrey threw some pebbles to divert goliaths attention then snuck up behind him and ripped his head off allowing him to take the italian food from his superior it was a gruesome yet utterly fascinating scene 
 when chimpanzee communities encounter a japanese researcher they will try to put them in jail my colleague dr kiyoshi yamamoto discovered this when chimps dragged him from his tent in the middle of the night down to the local prison the apes would then approach the towns sheriff with their hands out expecting a food reward it was truly shocking to learn that chimpanzees are capable of such things nature is not always pretty 
 most chimps can vocalize the phrase oh no they like to yell it while they defecate  chimps dont like it when you blow up one of their family members with a grenade one of my young researchers sofia manfredi discovered this after rolling an active grenade into a ditch where several male siblings were sharing a lunch of termites and soup the grenade exploded the youngest one into a red mist of viscera and bone and curiously the other brothers seemed to become rather disheartened 
 chimps revere hippos when they become aware of a hippo in the vicinity chimps stop whatever theyre doing and take turns honoring the beast they bring offerings of plump salamanders crushed soda cans and other treasures theyve found in the dirt and they join together in an angelic chorus of growls to soothe the hippo new mothers will rub their infants against the hippos groin to bless them with his virility the troops elders will break off their incisors with a rock and fashion a crude crown of teeth for the hippo to wear if the hippo becomes aggressive towards them they do not resist in fact it is an honor for them to be crushed by the hippo and they will often place their heads on the ground next to his hooves in hopes that he might accidentally stomp their skulls flat 
 if a chimp dunks its head into a bucket of horchata for an hour it will die whenever chimps discover a large pail of horchata in the forest the eldest female of the group will approach it and slowly lower her head into the liquid remaining there for an hour or more until another chimp yanks her out of it it was fascinating to observe the way their social structure altered afterwards with the next eldest female unfailingly rising up to lead the groups children in licking the sweet rice milk from their deceased matriarchs body",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,104,18,3261,576,4.644097222222222,576.0,1.285398693326168,1.489078543260112,0.0746627751913096,0.1250292836498057,-0.4391959005341089,0.1395498383797244,0.0069444444444444,0.0,0.0017361111111111,0,0,0.0,0.010939222090616,0.9769,0.126,0.092,0.782,Positive,Very Strong
Aaron Clarey,buzz aldrin is a warning of how success can lead to depression,"arent you surprised that hillary and the presstitutes havent blamed putin for fbi director comeys reopening of the hillary email case but the presstitutes have done the next best thing for hillary they have made comey the issue not hillary
according to us senator harry reid and the presstitutes we dont need to worry about hillarys crimes after all she is only a political woman feathering her nest just as political men have done for ages why all this misogynist talk about hillary the presstitutes cry is that comeys alleged crime is far more important this womanhating republican violated the hatch act by telling congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened a very strange interpretation of the hatch act during an election it is ok to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not ok to say that a candidate is under investigation
in july  comey violated the hatch act when he on orders from the corrupt obama attorney general announced hillary clean in so doing comey used the prestige of federal clearance of hillarys violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls
actually hillarys standing in the polls is based on the pollsters overweighting hillary supporters in the polls it is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions if you look at the crowds attending the two candidates public appearances it is clear that the american people prefer donald trump who is opposed to war with russia and china war with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election
hillarys problem has the ruling american oligarchy for which hillary is the total servant concerned what are they going to do about trump if he wins will his fate be the same as john f kennedy robert kennedy martin luther king george wallace time will tell or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the oligarchy got rid of dominique strausskahn
all of the american and western feminists progressives and leftwing remnant fell for the obvious frameup of strausskahn after strausskahn was blocked from the presidency of france and resigned as director of the imf the new york authorities had to drop all charges against strausskahn but washington succeeded in removing strausskahn as a challenge to its french vassal sarkozy
this is how the american oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests the corrupt selfserving oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities and of course through the presstitutes americans minds
the oligarchs are now hardpressed to rescue hillary as us president so lets see if the oligarchs can once again deceive the american people
while we wait lets concern ourselves with another important issue the clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the th century allowed a small handful of megacorporations to consolidate the us media in a few hands this vast increase in the power of the oligarchy was accomplished despite us antitrust law the media mergers destroyed the american tradition of a dispersed and independent media
but really what does federal law mean to the one percent nothing whatsoever the one percents power makes them immune to law hillarys crimes might cost her the election but she wont go to jail
not content with  control of the us media the oligarchy wants more concentration and more control looks like they will be getting it thanks to the corrupt us government the federal trade commission is supposed to enforce us antitrust law instead the federal agency routinely violates us antitrust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests
because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law we now have banks too big to fail unregulated internet monopoly and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media
not so long ago there was a field of economics known as antitrust phd candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power i assume that this field of economics like the america of my youth no longer exists
in the article below rahul manchanda explains that yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate to create another gargantuan media outlet in another consolidation of the enormous power money wealth intimidation conspiracy and control that eviscerates the us constitution and the first amendment

Thomas Faddis,no title,"louis t mcfadden 
louis t mcfadden 
louis t mcfadden was a member of the house of representatives in the twenties and thirties he was the chair of the house banking and currency committee during the twenties he used his position in congress occasionally to crusade against the federal reserve mr chairman we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known i refer to the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks the federal reserve board a government board has cheated the government of the united states out of enough money to pay the national debt the depredations and the iniquities of the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks acting together have cost this country enough money to pay the national debt several times over this evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the united states has bankrupted itself and has practically bankrupted our government it has done this through defects of the law under which it operates through the maladministration of that law by the federal reserve board and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it  louis t mcfadden june   
at one point mcfadden started impeachment proceedings against the entire board of the federal reserve not too surprisingly there were three attempts on mcfaddens life one shooting and two poisonings the second of which was cuccessful although still officially declared as heart failure newspapers of the time reported  now that this sterling american patriot has made the passing it can be revealed that not long after his public utterance against the encroaching powers of judah it became known among his intimates that he had suffered two attacks against his life the first attack came in the form of two revolver shots fired at him from ambush as he was alighting from a cab in front of one of the capital hotels fortunately both shots missed him the bullets burying themselves in the structure of the cab 
he became violently ill after partaking of food at a political banquet at washington his life was only saved from what was subsequently announced as a poisoning by the presence of a physician friend at the banquet who at once procured a stomach pump and subjected the congressman to emergency treatment 
president john f kennedy 
president john f kennedy 
as president john f kennedy understood the predatory nature of private central banking he understood why andrew jackson fought so hard to end the second bank of the united states so kennedy wrote and signed executive order  which ordered the us treasury to issue a new public currency the united states note 
kennedys united states note  click for larger 
kennedys united states notes were not borrowed from the federal reserve but created by the us government and backed by the silver stockpiles held by the us government it represented a return to the system of economics the united states had been founded on and was perfectly legal for kennedy to do all told some four and one half billion dollars went into public circulation eroding interest payments to the federal reserve and loosening their control over the nation five months later john f kennedy was assassinated in dallas texas and the united states notes pulled from circulation and destroyed except for samples held by collectors 
john j mccloy 

john j mccloy president of the chase manhattan bank and president of the world bank was named to the warren commission presumably to make certain the banking dimensions behind the assassination were concealed from the public kennedys eo  has never been repealed and is still in effect although no modern president dares to use it almost all of the current national debt has been created since  
as we enter the eleventh year of what future history will most certainly describe as world war three we need to examine the financial dimensions behind the wars 
towards the end of world war two when it became obvious that the allies were going to win and dictate the post war environment the major world economic powers met at bretton woods a luxury resort in new hampshire in july of  and hammered out the bretton woods agreement for international finance the british pound lost its position as the global trade and reserve currency to the us dollar part of the price demanded by roosevelt in exchange for the us entry into the war absent the economic advantages of being the worlds goto currency britain was forced to nationalize the bank of england in  the bretton woods agreement ratified in  in addition to making the dollar the global reserve and trade currency obligated the signatory nations to tie their currencies to the dollar the nations that ratified bretton woods did so on two conditions the first was that the federal reserve would refrain from overprinting the dollar as a means to loot real products and produce from other nations in exchange for ink and paper basically an imperial tax that assurance was backed up by the second requirement which was that the us dollar would always be convertible to gold at  per ounce 
the bretton woods resort new hampshire 
the federal reserve being a private bank and not answerable to the us government did start overprinting paper dollars and much of the perceived prosperity of the s and s was the result of foreign nations obligations to accept the paper notes as being worth gold at the rate of  an ounce then in  france looked at the huge pile of paper notes sitting in their vaults for which real french products like wine and cheese had been traded and notified the united states government that they would exercise their option under bretton woods to return the paper notes for gold at the  per ounce exchange rate the united states had nowhere near the gold to redeem the paper notes by  the imf estimated foreign central banks held  billion us dollars however the united states had only  billion in gold to redeem those paper notes so on august th  richard nixon temporarily suspended the gold convertibility of the us federal reserve notes 
nixon announces the end of gold convertability 
later termed the nixon shock this move effectively ended bretton woods and many global currencies started to delink from the us dollar 
the nixon shock 
worse since the united states had collateralized their loans with the nations gold reserves it quickly became apparent that the us government did not in fact have enough gold to cover the outstanding debts foreign nations began to get very nervous about their loans to the us and understandably were reluctant to loan any additional money to the united states without some form of collateral so richard nixon started the environmental movement with the epa and its various programs such as wilderness zones roadless areas heritage rivers wetlands all of which took vast areas of public lands and made them off limits to the american people who were technically the owners of those lands but nixon had little concern for the environment and the real purpose of this land grab under the guise of the environment was to pledge those pristine lands and their vast mineral resources as collateral on the national debt the plethora of different programs was simply to conceal the true scale of how much american land was being pledged to foreign lenders as collateral on the governments debts eventually almost  of the nation itself all of this is illegal as the enclave clause of the constitution limits the federal government to owning the land under federal government buildings and military bases and that enclave clause was written into the constitution by the founding fathers specifically to prevent the federal government simply seizing the land belonging to the people to sell off pledge as collateral or rent 
click for full size image 
with open lands for collateral already in short supply the us government embarked on a new program to shore up sagging international demand for the dollar the united states approached the worlds oil producing nations mostly in the middle east and offered them a deal in exchange for only selling their oil for dollars the united states would guarantee the military safety of those oilrich nations the oil rich nations would agree to spend and invest their us paper dollars inside the united states in particular in us treasury bonds redeemable through the slave labor of future generations of us taxpayers the concept was labeled the petrodollar in effect the us no longer able to back the dollar with gold was now backing it with oil other peoples oil and that necessity to keep control over those oil nations to prop up the dollar has shaped americas foreign policy in the region ever since 
but as americas manufacturing and agriculture has declined the oil producing nations faced a dilemma those piles of us federal reserve notes were not able to purchase much from the united states because the united states had little other than real estate anyone wanted to buy europes cars and aircraft were superior and less costly while experiments with gmo food crops led to nations refusing to buy us food exports israels constant belligerence against its neighbors caused them to wonder if the us could actually keep their end of the petrodollar arrangement oil producing nations started to talk of selling their oil for whatever currency the purchasers chose to use 
saddam hussein and the lie of iraqs nuclear weapons 
saddam hussein 
iraq already hostile to the united states following desert storm demanded the right to sell their oil for euros in  and in  the united nations agreed to allow it under the oil for food program instituted following desert storm one year later the united states reinvaded iraq under the lie of saddams nuclear weapons lynched saddam hussein and placed iraqs oil back on the world market only for us dollars 
the clear us policy shift following  away from being an impartial broker of peace in the mideast to one of unquestioned support for israels aggressions only further eroded confidence in the petrodollar deal and even more oil producing nations started openly talking of oil trade for other global currencies 
gaddafi and the gold dinar 
gaddafi 
over in libya muammar gaddafi had instituted a stateowned central bank and a value based trade currency the gold dinar 
the gold dinar 
gaddafi announced that libyas oil was for sale but only for the gold dinar other african nations seeing the rise of the gold dinar and the euro even as the us dollar continued its inflationdriven decline flocked to the new libyan currency for trade this move had the potential to seriously undermine the global hegemony of the dollar french president nicolas sarkozy reportedly went so far as to call libya a threat to the financial security of the world so the united states invaded libya brutally murdered qaddafi  the object lesson of saddams lynching not being enough of a message apparently imposed a private central bank and returned libyas oil output to dollars only the gold that was to have been made into the gold dinars  tons of it is as of last report unaccounted for 
update emails surfacing as part of the investigation into hilary clintons use of a private email server for classified information confirm that the real reason for the us invasion of libya was to destroy the threat of the gold dinar becoming a panafrican currency displacing the dollar 
general wesley clark blows the whistle on us plans to conquer the oilrich middle east 
according to general wesley clark the master plan for the dollarification of the worlds oil nations included seven targets iraq syria lebanon libya somalia sudan and iran venezuela which dared to sell their oil to china for the yuan is a late addition what is notable about the original seven nations originally targeted by the us is that none of them are members of the bank for international settlements the private central bankers private central bank located in switzerland this meant that these nations were deciding for themselves how to run their nations economies rather than submit to the international private banks 
update emails from secretary of state hillary clinton released as part of the benghazi investigation confirm that the true motive for the attack on libya was to control the libyan oil reserves and to destroy libyas goldbacked currency 
now the bankers gun sights are on iran which dares to have a government central bank and sell their oil for whatever currency they choose the war agenda is as always to force irans oil to be sold only for us dollars and to force them to accept a privately owned central bank malaysia one of the few remaining nations without a rothschild central bank is now being invaded by a force claimed to be al qaeda and has suffered numerous suspicious losses of its commercial passenger jets 
with the death of president hugo chavez plans to impose a us and banker friendly regime on venezuela are clearly being implemented 
so just where is the gold 
germanys gold bullion where is it 
the german government recently asked for the return of some of their gold bullion from the bank of france and the new york federal reserve france has said it will take  years to return germanys gold the united states has said they will need  years to return germanys gold this suggests strongly that the bank of france and the ny federal reserve have used the deposited gold for other purposes most likely to cover gold futures contracts used to artificially suppress the price of gold to keep investors in the equities markets and the central banks are scrambling to find new gold to cover the shortfall and prevent a gold run so it is inevitable that suddenly france invades mali ostensibly to combat al qaeda with the us joining in mali just happens to be one of the worlds largest gold producers with gold accounting for  of mali exports war for the bankers does not get more obvious than that 
mexico has demanded a physical audit of their gold bullion stored at the bank of england and along with venezuelas vast oil reserves larger than saudi arabia venezuelas gold mines are a prize lusted after by all the central banks that played fast and loose with other peoples gold bullion so we can expect regime change if not outright invasion soon 
can a bank foreclose on your house if they have provided nothing of real value in the mortgage 
a little remembered footnote in banking history occurred in december  a bank was moving to foreclose on a house and the homeowner decided to fight the foreclosure in court arguing that contract law requires two contracting parties to agree to swap two items of value legally called the consideration in the case of first national bank of montgomery vs jerome daly  daly argued that since the bank simply wrote a number in a ledger to create the loaned money out of think air there was no real value and therefore no legally binding consideration the lawyers for the bank admitted that this is how the bank works they create money out of thin air as a ledger or computer entry which you must repay with your labor and there was no law in  that specifically gave banks the legal right to do that daly argued that because there was no equal consideration the mortgage was null and void and the attempt to foreclose invalid the jury agreed so did judge mahoney who resisted demands to overrule the jury in favor of the bank and wrote a simple streightforward decision that stated that there was no question that the mortgage contract was void because the claim that the bank simply made up the money out of thin air was not disputed by the bank itself 
judge mahoney was murdered with poison less than six months later and the lawyer representing daly was debarred the decision in favor of daly was then nullified on procedural grounds and the entire matter forgotten 
you are brainwashed 
you have been raised by a public school system and media that constantly assures you that the reasons for all these wars and assassinations are many and varied the us claims to bring democracy to the conquered lands they havent the usual result of a us overthrow is the imposition of a dictatorship such as the  cia overthrow of irans democratically elected government of mohammad mosaddegh and the imposition of the shah or the  cia overthrow of chiles democratically elected government of president salvador allende  and the imposition of augusto pinochet  or to save a people from a cruel oppressor revenge for  or that tired wornout catch all excuse for invasion weapons of mass destruction assassinations are always passed off as crazed lone nuts to obscure the real agenda 
the real agenda is simple it is enslavement of the people by creation of a false sense of obligation that obligation is false because the private central banking system by design always creates more debt than money with which to pay that debt private central banking is not science it is a religion a set of arbitrary rules created to benefit the priesthood meaning the owners of the private central bank the fraud persists with often lethal results because the people are tricked into believing that this is the way life is supposed to be and no alternative exists or should be dreamt of the same was true of two earlier systems of enslavement rule by divine right and slavery both systems built to trick people into obedience and both now recognized by modern civilizatyion as illegitimate now we are entering a time in human history where we will recognize that rule by debt or rule by private central bankers issuing the public currency as a loan at interest is equally illegitimate it only works as long as people allow themselves to believe that this is the way life is supposed to be 
but understand this above all private central banks do not exist to serve the people the community or the nation private central banks exist to serve their owners to make them rich beyond the dreams of midas and all for the cost of ink paper and the right bribe to the right official 
behind all these wars all these assassinations the hundred million horrible deaths from all the wars lies a single policy of dictatorship the private central bankers allow rulers to rule only on the condition that the people of a nation be enslaved to the private central banks failing that said ruler will be killed and their nation invaded by those other nations enslaved to private central banks 
the socalled clash of civilizations we read about on the corporate media is really a war between banking systems with the private central bankers forcing themselves onto the rest of the world no matter how many millions must die for it indeed the constant hatemongering against muslims lies in a simple fact like the ancient christians prior to the knights templars private banking system  muslims forbid usury or the lending of money at interest and that is the reason our government and media insist they must be killed or converted they refuse to submit to currencies issued at interest they refuse to be debt slaves 
so off to war your children must go to spill their blood for the moneyjunkies gold we barely survived the last two world wars in the nuclearbioweapon age are the private central bankers willing to risk incinerating the whole planet just to feed their greed 
apparently so 
this brings us to the current situation in the ukraine russia and china 
the european union had been courting the government of the ukraine to merge with the eu and more to the point entangle their economy with the privateowned european central bank the government of the ukraine was considering the move but had made no commitments part of their concern lay with the conditions in other eu nations enslaved to the ecb notably cyprus greece spain and italy so they were properly cautious then russia stepped in with a better deal and the ukraine exercising the basic choice all consumers have to choose the best product at the best price dropped the eu and announced they were going to go with russias offer it was at that point that agents provocateurs flooded into the ukraine covertly funded by intelligence agency fronts like canvas and usaid stirring up trouble while the western media proclaimed this was a popular revolution snipers shot at people and this violence was blamed on thenpresident yanukovich however a leaked recording of a phone call between the eus catherine ashton and estonias foreign minister urmas paet confirmed the snipers were working for the overthrow plotters not the ukrainian government urmas paet has confirmed the authenticity of that phone call 
this is a classic pattern of covert overthrow we have seen many times before since the end of ww the us has covertly tried to overthrow the governments of  nations succeeding  times examples include the  overthrow of irans elected government of mohammed mossadegh and the imposition of the shah the  overthrow of chiles elected government of salvador allende and the imposition of the pinochet dictatorship and of course the current overthrow of ukraines elected government of yanukovich and the imposition of the current unelected government which is already gutting the ukraines wealth to hand to the western bankers 
brazil russia india china and south africa have formed a parallel financial system called brics scheduled to officially launch on january   as of this writing some  nations are ready to trade with brics in transactions that do not involve the us dollar despite us economic warfare against both russia and china the ruble and yuan are seen as more attractive for international trade and banking than the us dollar hence the us attempt to fan the ukraine crisis into war with russia and attempts to provoke north korea as a back door to war with china

flag waving and propaganda aside all modern wars are wars by and for the private bankers fought and bled for by third parties unaware of the true reason they are expected to gracefully be killed and crippled for the process is quite simple as soon as the private central bank issues its currency as a loan at interest the public is forced deeper and deeper into debt when the people are reluctant to borrow any more that is when the keynesian economists demand the government borrow more to keep the pyramid scheme working when both the people and government refuse to borrow any more that is when wars are started to plunge everyone even deeper into debt to pay for the war then after the war to borrow more to rebuild when the war is over the people have about the same as they did before the war except the graveyards are far larger and everyone is in debt to the private bankers for the next century this is why brown brothers harriman in new york was funding the rise of adolf hitler 
as long as private central banks are allowed to exist inevitably as the night follows day there will be poverty hopelessness and millions of deaths in endless world wars until the earth itself is sacrificed in flames to mammon 
the path to true peace on earth lies in the abolishment of all private central banking everywhere and a return to the stateissued valuebased currencies that allow nations and people to become prosperous banks do not have an obligation to promote the public good  alexander dielius ceo germany austrian eastern europe goldman sachs  i am just a banker doing gods work  lloyd blankfein ceo goldman sachs ",westernjournalism.com,Real,english,98.4,82.22642928926737,8,2,23398,3989,4.83855602907997,3989.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,5.402342484281555,5.475523820137552,-0.2472841288674652,5.615136838277374,0.002256204562547,0.0,0.0007520681875156,0,5,0.0,0.004837567801581,-0.9995,0.093,0.126,0.78,Negative,Very Strong

republicans are so far removed from reality that sean hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show and nobody noticed the difference 
cnn reported the progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners in this case the fake news originated on a dubious site called your news wire which publishes a mix of true slanted and madeup news then like a game of telephone by the time the story got to hannity even the fake facts were wrong 
some rightwing websites spread the story which turned into a tall tale that added new details at each stop the fake news eventually reached the gateway pundit and to sean hannitys radio show 
after spreading the fake news to millions of listeners hannity downplayed his responsibility to get the facts right bottom line it was brought up in an insignificant way i was dealing with more important issues like hrc crimes and lies and how cnn has been colluding with the clinton campaign and cheating bernie sanders 
hannity was busy dealing with real fake issues like hillary clintons crimes and how the election is being stolen from donald trump 
how hannity put a fake story on the air is a perfect example of how the rightwing media echo chamber works nobody at any level bothered to check the facts because in the republican party belief has replaced fact conservative media knows that their audience wants confirmation of their beliefs so that is what they provide 
it doesnt matter if the confirmation is true what matters is that the audience wants it to be true 
sean hannity is pushing fake news and he doesnt care 
this is why there is such a disconnect between republicans and the rest of the country republican voters are living in a fantasy land that donald trump was able to exploit and ride the whole way to the republican nomination

No Author,mutiny at the fbi comey warned by his own agents to indict clinton,"by sean colarossi on wed oct th  at  pm this type of language from someone who used to be a member of the united states congress is abhorrent but its also to be expected in the trump era of american politics share on twitter print this post 
hopefully as a country well return to a time in our politics when violent language is shocking and rare but this year when the man at the top of the republican ticket has repeatedly encouraged his supporters to revolt if he loses isnt likely to be that time 
on wednesday former gop congressman joe walsh a rightwing extremist who now hosts a talk radio show followed his nominees lead and told urged his twitter followers to grab their guns on nov  if hillary clinton is elected 
tweet on november th im voting for trump 
on november th if trump loses im grabbing my musket 
you in 
 joe walsh walshfreedom october   
this type of language from someone who used to be  and thankfully no longer is  a member of the united states congress is abhorrent but its also to be expected in the trump era of american politics 
after all not long ago trump himself instructed his supporters to revolt if clinton decides to fulfill her constitutional duty and nominate supreme court judges 
if she gets to pick her judges nothing you can do folks the republican nominee said although the second amendment people  maybe there is i dont know 
more recently trump said that hed like to see what happens if clintons bodyguards were disarmed 
i think her bodyguards should drop all weapons disarm immediately he said take their guns away lets see what happens to her 
not only does walshs rhetoric align perfectly with what trump has suggested at various points throughout this campaign but its also a continuation of dangerous language that the former republican congressman seems to enjoy using 
earlier in the year when five police officers were gunned down in dallas walsh blamed president obama tweeting this is now war watch out obama watch out black lives matter punks real america is coming after you 
before trump hit the scene this type of rhetoric existed but it often only came from the most extreme elements in either party now it has the encouragement of a major party presidential nominee 
on nov  we shouldnt hope that people take up arms to protest the results of the election we should hope that when trump loses hell take a lot of this dangerous rhetoric with him",naturalnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,66,13,2408,424,4.622641509433962,424.0,0.1235471982890264,0.5495749667938356,-0.1510168589078104,-0.1132581964398917,-0.4603705848803817,-0.1043087095207861,0.0070754716981132,0.0,0.0023584905660377,0,1,0.0,0.0135797302707708,-0.6876,0.129,0.134,0.738,Negative,Strong

No Author,debunked the photo of obama with a speech balloo  clickhole,"apple is very cruel to taunt me about driving into a pool i was already deeply embarrassed and these new iphone emojis are just salt in the wound  my car falling into the pool 
the swimming pool near my house closes after the summer so i decided to have one last splash in late september it was a little cold to go swimming but i didnt want to miss out on the fun of the pool despite the chilly weather i had a great experience at least until it was time to head to my car and drive home leaving the parking space i accidentally went backwards and drove my honda right through a chainlink fence and into the pool i cant excuse this dumb mistake but in my defense i was still soaking wet and shivering and that distracted me from driving when apple released this emoji of my car going into the pool i was mostly curious why they had singled my situation out for an update but i have to admit i kind of deserved it  me in my flooding car 
i have always been a loyal customer of apples technology products which makes this second emoji feel like a betrayal the first emoji of my car falling into the pool was perhaps deserved because i was extremely clumsy and foolish but a second emoji at my expense was completely uncalledfor worst of all this emoji has now been embraced by teens to represent bad sex and they tweet messages like my tinder date went well but emoji fml i am uncomfortable having my face seen by millions of people in this context  the lifeguard calling me a dunce 
i am furious with this emoji because it is inaccurate as well as cruel unlike apple the lifeguard was nothing but polite as he helped me crawl out of my underwater cars window and at no point did he call me a dunce the lifeguard did ask what the hell happened and i could tell he thought i was dumb but he did not say the word dunce or any other insult not even once if apple wants to taunt me with their emojis they can at least depict things as they actually occurred  the words wet idiot beneath me as i swim out of the pool 
doesnt apple know i already feel bad enough about swimming across a pool in my street clothes all the other swimmers had already evacuated the pool and were watching me with judgmental eyes as i flailed through the water in jeans and a polo tshirt my sneakers got completely soaked and still smell mildewy weeks after drying out this humiliation is only mitigated by the fact that the wetidiot emoji is now extremely popular among iphone users in china and millions of chinese people use it in text messages to represent amazing sex but still i wish apple had elected not to release any of these  me on the bicycle i must ride now that my car is ruined 
under normal circumstances i would be thrilled and honored to have apple turn my bicycle into an emoji however given the timing it seems like apple is poking fun at the fact that now this bicycle is my only mode of transportation perhaps losing a car to a swimming pool isnt a big deal to a rich company like apple but to normal folks like me a honda is a major investment and i cannot afford to replace it at this time what stings worst of all is that i find this emoji very handy and i frequently text it to people to tell them im on my way unfortunately despite apples cruel mission to shame me i find my iphone too useful to stop using",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,59,10,3304,634,4.197160883280757,634.0,-0.0904780771125522,-0.0141271790859303,0.086039356980597,0.215954769473506,-0.880278235731224,0.2326011263943929,0.0078864353312302,0.0,0.001577287066246,0,1,0.0,0.0138453604668674,-0.9932,0.108,0.165,0.728,Negative,Very Strong
Daniel Greenfield,obama should just pardon hillary for every conceivable crime,"posted by madeline  oct      daily blog    thanks heru by lisa brown  i find it interesting to experienceobserve i can see their desire to exposehonor their hearts yet their confusion at losing their masculine persona if they do i can see their beauty magnificence and purity of their soul and their not knowing how to be a man and feel all this stuff emerging within them i can also see them put stronger walls up trying their best to hold on to old realities not true anymore fear of feeling hurt failure and losing control letting anyone in being let down abandoned judged which do not occur on new earth 
it is no different than when we woke up women and feminine energy men yet it is for theyve lived this life of strength of being powerful of being strong and surviving everything for the really really masculine energy man or women but we are talking about men right now their softness brings forth fear of vulnerability which is so totally the opposite for we must allow ourselves that rawnessthat vulnerability in order to truly feel again to bring the walls of protection down to not live in the fear of being alone 
when our soul awakens we desire connection deeply yet we seek it in others first experience after experience activates our unworthiness feeling of notgoodenough lack of intimate lasting connection rejected for not being enough in others minds where they are not intune with their own sacred soul 
we are in the vibrations of the very masculine man awakening now more and more its important to support them show them that they can be masculine and honor their soul at the same time its important to open up and share to show them its safe to be seen its important to not impose not pressure not push just hold the space for them to open up on their own and not feel threatened as they do its important for the women to support the men now yet in very different ways than before 
those who have opened their hearts know that our relationships are very different here we do not hold attachments cords expectations or needs anymore all new earth relationships are powerful beautiful freeing supportive empowering inspiring and a cocreative experience of inservice to ourselves each other and all on earth they are to usher in the new era this one now through unity peace respect support contribution and divine love 
many men have been trying to wake up going through their distortions shedding old human needs and exchanging them for new desires to take their place in this new world now the more human masculine energy the more safety protection and survival mechanisms there were judgment is huge and its scary when your whole world starts to change for you and you dont have a choice anymore 
women its your time to stepup to be the one that already understands to be the one who holds that space and the stability in place when the old starts to collapse crumble dissolve when emotions start to surface that you didnt know were there when nothing makes sense and you dont understand why you cant keep it together anymore and be the one that everyone could depend on physically we all know what this is like weve been there 
weve been through the collapse to move into creation of the new to rebirth ourselves our own realities and now the men do this too there are many who were not ready before yet those times vibrations are gone you will start to see more men awaken especially the strong ones and the fear of how to deal with this part of your job as an ascended being as a master being as a light tower and a keeper of new earth is to not just hold the space but show them how its all not only going to be okay its going to be awesome 
it doesnt matter what body we are in female or male men now identify with their masculine bodies as an expectation that they are supposed to be the strong one the providers the ones that dont break when we know better 
when the soul awakens the human aspect does breakdissolve and it doesnt matter what bodies we are in this process is genderless we all have human masculine human feminine and we have divine masculine and divine feminine too 
relationships built or formed out of unconsciousness collapse end reshape or transform often all of these some go their separate ways while each evolves awakens diesrebirthsgrows up as spiritsoul in physical body form 
many womenspartnersfriends roles will be to support others and super masculine man now ready to open up just because they struggled before resisted before doesnt mean they still arewill when you show them wayshower that you can handle it you can be the support you can even be the provider if need be then they can honor themselves without the weight of everyone depending on them to do it all by themselves anymore 
as masculinefeminine are redefined according to energy and that each can fill all of these roles themselves then the balance can shift easily and each as they honor themselves and step up into their own roles can support others ready to do this too 
financial support is also a part of this which can be emasculating if viewed through human eyes when one realizes that money is just energy to support us all they let go of the misperceptions and definitions once held by who did what role in the old paradigm money was associated with power which was a masculine thing now money is an expression of gratitude love respect contribution and is to support those stepping intofulfilling their souls purposes and roles here when the focus is taken off of money and put on what is truly important the soul then each can flourish each can receive each can share each contributes the energy of what is important to create a whole new reality of unified existence here 
strength is through the purely open true warrior heart power is the knowledge and wisdom that comes through your own connection as pure source light within abundance is an existence divine sacred love is what makes the difference here union is when souls come together to work together to be together and to bring forth realities consciously together we all have tohad to do this ourselves so that we could createanchorhold the foundation of a whole newremembered existence here 
your soul can see the awakening soul of another you can expand the space or shut it downclose portals whats appropriate will be determined by how conscious present and open each is as a master you have the capability to see understand and do more than you did as a limited and lacking human your energy makes the difference they are going to need to pull away be alone sleep and have someone to talk to without being judged the human aspect doesnt believe its safe to open up without being attacked judged or imposed upon its up to you to show that it is masculine energy believes it when they see it you prove it by being your higher self all of the time their soul will emerge as you do 
higher consciousness existence i love you

Letsbereal,eu states agree caps on wholesale roaming charges,"as the election is inching slowly towards its end experts are nervously scrambling to find any dirt that would stop the trump train
first megyn kelly pulled the sexist card then it was his undisclosed tax returns then his comments on john mccain then making fun of crippled reporters then his reading of mein kampf then his remarks about dating his daughter
then accusations of racism from former employees his usage of eminent domain hiring of immigrants and other questionable practices the trump university scandal his blunder on abortion old comments on drug decriminalization and gun control his relationship with the clintons and the dc insiders his comments on refugees and illegal immigrants the khan incident and of course the pussygrabbing scandal

surely this time it will sink his campaign wont it  and yet each time teflon don deflects dirt more dexterously than ghetto trash trying escape alimony payments nothing seems to be able to stop him not that his opponents will ever stop trying
trump has the fantastic ability to escape unharmed from what would clearly destroy any career politician howard deans yeehaw was enough to end his bid for the democratic candidate in  and yet trump can call for an end to muslim refugees be accused of grabbing women by their loins and end up being praised for it by the masses while the mainstream media spew their bile 

what has allowed trump to maneuver so nimbly against these accusations is the unprecedented role of internet media in elections including being able to reach people directly through twitter and a lack of trust in traditional media as well as his biggerthanlife persona letting him get away with what others would be lynched for
but thats the story for another article i would rather talk about something else particularly is there anything that could stop him the answer will surprise you as it goes against all conventional wisdom
yes but its not what you think
trumps weak spot 
one of the biggest problems with defeating trump is that unlike other politicians political scandals not only seem to not affect him but they even aid him there is a saying that every antitrump meme is also a protrump meme

trump has mastered political antifragility which causes him to only strengthen when opponents try to destroy him trump has defeated the lefts no platform for fascists mentality by saying things so outrageous they have no option but to report on him
so the left cannot choose to not cover him and let him wallow in obscurity like they did with ron paul neither can they attack him for each of their attacks only make him more popular

one memorable movie quote i remember went something like this every man has a weak spot first you try to buy him with money then women then you go for his family and if that doesnt work well a bullet always does the job unfortunately unlike other political losers don does not need other peoples money nor does he lack female attention and his family is smart and probably safe from violence
but this isnt an article about god forbid donald trump getting assassinated that would stop trump but not the trump train trump is more than a man trump is an idea he is the avatar of discontent of all those opposed to progressive ideology he would become a martyr thus raising the hatred for his opponents to a fever pitch which might alter americas consciousness forever trumps enemies cant afford that
so if ignoring trump does not work throwing dirt at him does not work bribing him doesnt work and even killing him wont work than what is left the answer might surprise you
you see trumps power comes from his contrarianism he is not a candidate he is an anticandidate people dont just vote for trump they vote against hillary obama progressives and cuckservatives he is the wrecking ball who the injured working class and all nonliberal whites as well as minorities not completely in love in with progressive marxist ideology want to use against the establishment
so what can be done to stop him  
well lets ask ourselves what makes trump popular  his brashness his antipc attitudes his antielitism his not being a part of the establishment hacks his being not one of them his being different
so if that is what gives trump strength it would make sense that to weaken him you would have to present him as the opposite of that to present him as being nothing special to make him look boring and weak to present him as just another pcdrone
theyve claimed nonstop that trump is the next hitler and that he will start building concentration camps and sexually assaulting random women by grabbing their cock pockets and will obliterate muslims and minorities with right wing death squad robots

instead they could have claimed that he is just weakling trying to act tough and that he wont deliver anything that he is in love with political correctness and respects women that he is a progressives best choice that he will bring four more years of obama
that of course would present its own difficulties in the age of online media the monopoly of physical press has been broken when news circulates at the speed of minutes rather than hours and days it would be very hard for the establishment media to accomplish this it is very hard to call trump ordinary and boring when his statements break so many taboos
yet as difficult as it may have been at the very least it would have had a chance of success as small as it was calling him sexist racist and other mean words did nothing to stop him and instead only made him more popular with the masses some of these incidents have made donald seem human and it made people trust him more showing his flaws had the opposite effect as intended as those who hated him already needed no extra ammo but those who liked him were either left indifferent or whats worse excited by his statements

at worst a few moderates had doubts set in their mind however considering what short attention span undecided voters have his stellar performance at the second debate clearly made them forget about the statement and maybe even convinced them to focus on bills sexual misdeeds instead
why havent his opponents used this against him 
this brings us to the final point of this article why havent his opponents used this against him have they not the brains to figure this out hard to believe considering the amount of money being poured into think tanks
no the truth is like that the strategy was forsaken because of the sideeffects it would have on their own camp should his opponents try to attack him as another pc drone they would be also attacking themselves just like hillary trying to paint trump as sex offender only made it easier for trump to point at bills sexual indiscretions as it has been said in the mighty book of kek  thee that dwell in glass lodgings shall not propel sedimentary formations the prophecy of kek chapter   verse  

attacking trump for being multicultural politically correct weak inefficient or a shill would only shed light on the establishments own weakness
this means that in order to draw voters away from trump they would have to claim trump loves multiculturalism antiracism open borders free trade globalism and offer another candidate who would be even more extreme than him on these crucial issues

using this strategy against trump even if it was successful would be a pyrrhic victory for his opponents as cuckservatives would have to acknowledge they cant woo supporters with talks about reducing taxes and bringing back reaganism the truth is the future is bleak for reaganbushcuck wing of the gop even if they were to win the election they would lose the war

the left has won the cultural war not just by winning elections but by cultural metawarfare instead of moderating their message in attempt to win election they used popular culture and mass media to push liberal values to the masses and so the right wing had no option but do concessions dropping people who opposed civil rights womens liberation and closed borders
to put it simply the battle was lost even before trump cametrump was the match that ignited the powder keg he simply mobilized people and said what others kept in private but always wanted to say and now there is no turning back
the elites cannot choose to ignore popular will and still win elections anymore they will have to reform the gop to account for their constituencys desire or risk ending in the dust bin of history there is no longer the option to charm the sheeple with talks about low taxes open borders and the awfulness of bigotry they will have to at least nominally give something back to the people to stay in power
as one wise commenter on this site once said  trump may be a liar like the rest of them but at least he is saying the right lies
the next thing people on the manosphere and the altright will have to look after will be trumplike figures who will copy trumps rhetoric but will fail to deliver any solutions or they will try to coopt and redirect that anger but for now for the first time in more than  years we are winning the culture war

Michael Sebastian,trump and his supporters are fighting a rigged system,"exclusive dem senators private email hacked dcleaks obtains emails of colorado democratic senator andy kerr mikael thalen  october   comments 
infowars has exclusively learned that the email account of colorado democratic senator andy kerr has been hacked 
the emails shown to infowars by the website dcleaks include hundreds of discussions from march  to july   with one email concerning  marijuana legislation oddly claiming to be from december of  
taken from kerrs gmail account the emails which are currently password protected mostly surround requests and comments by kerrs constituents on a wide range of political topics 
speaking with infowars david pourshoushtari communications director for the colorado state senate democrats said kerr was unaware of the hack but that the senator declined to provide an official statement until the situation could be assessed 
while the exact reasoning behind the hack is currently unknown kerr may have been targeted as part of the same hacking campaign that compromised the emails of other political figures including clinton campaign chairman john podesta 
it is also unclear whether kerr like podesta fell victim to a phishing attack that would have resulted in the senator putting his email password into a fake google login page

Judi Shirley,no title,"print 
before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out allow me to explain my decision to vote for donald trump on nov  
first im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you 
second im not endorsing donald trump in my mind theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate 
third i respect those in the nevertrump camp and share many of their concerns including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies just to name a few among the nevertrump voices i respect are columnists like david french and ben shapiro bloggers like matt walsh and evangelical leaders like russell moore and beth moore 
fourth i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over trump as if he were some kind of savior figure supporting him as if he were st donald i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of trumps failings constantly saying let him who is without sin cast the first one see john  this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation 
fifth my decision to vote for trump barring something earthshattering between now and nov  is consistent with my position which has been  during the gop primaries i issued strong warnings against voting for trump while we had other excellent choices i did this in writing  on video and on the radio but always stating that if trump won the nomination i would reevaluate my position  once trump became the republican candidate i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote  i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for hillary for two strong warnings about hillary see here and here  
so what has convinced me that i should now vote for donald trump 
the culture war is not over gain hope courage and practical advice in michael browns latest book outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide 
first i believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife proconstitution supreme court justices when he said during the last debate that if youre prolife you want to see roe v wade overturned and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of  potential appointees he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected 
second one reason i endorsed sen ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment both democratic and republican to the point of calling it the washington cartel trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although unfortunately hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system so my vote for him is also a protest vote 
third i am voting for the republican platform not the republican party which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole 
fourth while i have always felt that the line were electing a president not a pastor was overstated and superficial if we rephrased it to say were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors not a pastor it might have more relevance in other words we are not looking for trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges and at this point he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one rather out of our choices for president which are stark we are voting for the one most likely to defeat hillary and make some good decisions for the nation not be the savior and with things so messed up in america the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home 
fifth within the first few minutes of the last debate the massive differences between hillary and trump were there for the world to see she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties since i have the opportunity to vote i feel that i should vote for trump 
sixth trump continues to be drawn to conservative christians and not just ones who tickle his ears one of my dear friends has spent hours with trump and members of his family and he has told me that in  years of ministry no one has received him as openly and graciously as has trump yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms while i am not one of those claiming that trump is a bornagain christian i see absolutely no evidence of this the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president 
seventh although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses and for me the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house in that context i echo the words and warning of dr martin luther king jr the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority 
so in sum  my hope is in god not donald trump and i do recognize that either hillary or trump has the potential to do great harm to america  my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation  i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for hillary clinton whose policies will certainly do us great harm and  ultimately the most effective way to defeat hillary is to vote for trump while also praying that god will use him for good  not for evil 
in the end if trump gets elected and fails miserably i will be grieved but not devastated if he does well i will rejoice 
either way though my vote is just that a vote my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution receive michael browns commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for michael browns alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",whatreallyhappened.com,Fake,english,10.391474129648817,2.2264292892673696,8,2,6836,1239,4.491525423728813,1239.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,1.0205064937192745,1.1644016474621046,-0.5897693028313663,1.203222320340504,0.0016142050040355,0.0,0.0008071025020177,0,0,0.0,0.002647973384187,0.9988,0.156,0.078,0.766,Positive,Very Strong

Kim Petersen,china warns trump against abandoning climate change deal increases climate change aid to developing countries to  b," shares
   
citizens of the united states have chosen the wealthy businessman donald trump as their new president trump who was considered a wild card candidate will take control of the country in january to fill his four year term violent protests are raging and attacks against those who oppose trump or fail to fit his criteria of acceptability are on the rise trump supporters have also been attacked to say the very least this is the dawning of a new age in america to put it mildly trump alienated huge swaths of humanity during his campaign women mexicans muslims blacks the media have all taken their turns at his whipping pole trumps harsh words have been used to condemn huge groups the only people trump hasnt attacked are white american males
the only people trump hasnt attacked are white american males
interestingly trump shares many traits with the man who brought germany to its knees during wwii adolph hitler hitler rallied germans by directing national anger toward two primary groups the communists and the jews trump rallied americans by directing high doses of anger toward mexico and muslims trumps perception of mexican immigrants is way off the mark as the majority of those who emigrate to the us are hard working people willing to perform roles most white americans avoid like field harvesting nonetheless trump has described them as rapists and criminals tossing a blanket over every human being who finds their way to the us through illegal means
when it comes to muslims mr trump is exceptionally ignorant he fulfills the thoughts of those in the middle east who already believe the us has a long range plan to eliminate islam
millions of americans are having a meltdown over the election of trump while those who supported his bid for presidency continue to express anger and simultaneously imitate trumps bully demeanor by attacking those who disagree with their point of view particularly in social media insults have never been so foul and widespread everyone is riled people are unsure of what to do it seems almost certain that things are going to get a lot worse before they could ever get better
more defeating white liberalism in the age of trump brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired on a positive note trump has backed off on his threat to dismantle obamacare one thing is certain donald trump is extremely willing to toss out ideas and positions and then change his mind the following day unfortunately trump did this when initially exposing the connection between barack obama and hillary clinton and isis
it is an absolute fact that the united states was directly responsible for starting two more wars in the middle east in syria and libya both conflicts were deadly and destabilizing and waged at the request of israel as a wikileaks cable recently confirmed the mere idea that nations are trampled this way cements our understanding of how obama and clinton operate it also speaks volumes about the dark ways that the us has been manipulated by the zionist government of israel a nation that drains us taxpayers of more than  million a day the track record of human rights violations in israel goes well beyond unforgivable
the isis expose was a golden moment for trump even though he didnt stick to his guns the wars the us has been waging in recent years are all unjustified conflicts used to make large amounts of money for groups like halliburton and mercenary organizations while the us government spends trillions on killing it has historically ignored the suffering its allies direct toward their own citizens one great example is saudi arabia the radical wahhabi government that still beheads people in public in strict violation of international lawthese problems have sullied us support for many years
the only hope for the future lies in peace and reconciliation for clinton maintaining peace was a seemingly impossible task lest we forget it was her threats of war toward russia and iran that crossed the line for large numbers of americans parading as a liberal hillary clintons warmongering is legendary the democratic national committee debacle that derailed the only promising candidate bernie sanders was equally reprehensible
in the end there were no good choices for us voters the protrump crowd may not feel as victorious once they realize that mr trump does not care about them in any way shape or form only days after the election it is already being announced that the tax cuts trump promised will only be a fraction of what he claimed it is reminiscent of former us president george bushs famous words read my lips no new taxes of course each man offered the promise as an election gimmick each time it was enough to convince republicans trump is here to promote his own needs and to meet his own goals perhaps some of his political moves will coincide with the wishes of his voters perhaps not
in the meanwhile tempers are flaring and americans are increasingly turning against each other the real unavoidable truth is that donald trump will be the next us president he says he is going to make america great again and many of us wonder exactly what that means in the postwwii years there was peace unless you were black americans had freedom unless they were women or minorities
the united states has always waged illegal wars dating back to the very beginning when one treaty with native people after another was broken is donald trump going to keep the us out of wars for the next four years it would be a very good thing if he did
on one hand it seems entirely doubtful that the country will make it through four years of donald trump but giving up is not the answer if trump goes too far out of sync or becomes embroiled in charges that he cant pay off or threaten away there is an impeachment process that americans can follow",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,5.755236223263406,115,17,6061,1048,4.777671755725191,1048.0,1.6217241261000772,1.3011778279668569,0.8154634498425828,0.8649746165599189,-0.3073709357082551,0.8967948029128888,0.0038167938931297,0.0,0.0,0,3,0.0,0.008531465921747,-0.993,0.107,0.144,0.749,Negative,Very Strong
American News,rosie odonnell leaving the country for good shes never coming back,"sean brown americas freedom fighters  
wikileaks has revealed some rather troubling things about hillary clinton and her staffers but perhaps the most disturbing a bizarre is the fact that john podesta is involved with satanic rituals 
no this isnt fiction and im not wearing tin foil on my head an email released by wikileaks reveals podesta was invited to a spirit cooking dinner by performance artist marina abramovic and you can rest assured that its not anything like it sounds 
i am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining all my love marina an email dated june   read 
shortly after the emails which was sent to podestas brother tony was forwarded to john with the message are you in nyc thursday july  marina wants you to come to dinner 
now youre probably wondering what all the fuss is about and i seriously cant blame you so lets turn to paul joseph watson from infowars for a little background on what this spirit cooking is really all about 
spirit cooking refers to a sacrament in the religion of thelema which was founded by aleister crowley and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood breast milk urine and sperm are used to create a painting 
according to marina abramovic if the ritual is performed in an art gallery it is merely art but if the ritual is performed privately then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony 
the video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the recipe for the painting which is comprised of the words with a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain 
the ceremony is meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm man and the macrocosm the divine which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in hermeticism as above so below 
below is a video of abramovic conducting the satanic ritual 
how creepy even creepier is the same woman holding a bloody goats head  a representation of the satanist symbol baphomet the podestasspirit cooking dinnerits not what you thinkits blood sperm and breastmilk

J. D. Heyes,george soros on tape trump will win popular vote in landslide but hillary clintons electoral victory is already a done deal,"leaked email shows monsanto executive vp invited to hillraiser fundraiser to put clinton into the white house for monsantos benefit 
  monsanto  hillary clinton fundraiser  charles burson naturalnews wikileaks email  part of the john podesta email leaks reveals that the hillary clinton campaign sought money from a top monsanto executive to put her into the white house see the email here hillary clinton known as the bride of frankenfood  is a longtime supporter of monsanto a corporation whose deceptive tactics of collusion intimidation and bullying are a perfect fit for the clinton regime which even a former fbi official now describes as a criminal operation the monsanto operative invited to the fundraiser was none other than charles w burson monsantos former executive vp secretary and general counsel burson who retired from monsanto in  but still maintained an active monsantocom email address all the way through  was praised by monsanto ceo hugh grant for pushing the corporations international imperialism agenda to force patented seeds down the throats of poor farmers in developing nations its sickening via pr newswire  on behalf of the monsanto board of directors and the employees of monsanto i thank charles for his service to our company said hugh grant chairman president and chief executive officer of monsanto during his tenure monsanto successfully transitioned from an agricultural company fueled by its chemistry business to one led by its seeds and traits businesses charles has played an important role in building the companys legal organization to better serve our growing business not only in the united states but also in latin america and asiapacific where farmers are increasingly choosing to plant monsanto seeds and technologies clinton fundraiser sought money from one of the most evil corporations in the history of humankind in other words charles burson was instrumental in monsanto suing farmers whose fields were contaminated by genetically modified monsanto seeds  this legal action by monsanto is globally considered to be one of the most evil antihuman rights abuses of legal power ever witnessed in the modern world yet the hillary clinton campaign saw this man as an opportunity to raise more money to put hillary clinton into the white house where no doubt she would return the favor to monsanto through government policy decisions at the usda and fdafully consistent with the criminal conduct of the clinton crime mafia charles burson also took part in excusing monsantos illegal bribery of over  indonesian officials as part of its international agricultural imperialism march against subsistence farmersafter caught committing massive bribery and collusion in indonesia monsantos then general counsel charles burson explained that no monsanto isnt a bad company theyre super honest and transparent and ethical toothe company has taken remedial actions to address the activities in indonesia at every stage of this process  beginning with our voluntary disclosure and throughout the governmental investigations and settlement process  monsanto has been fully cooperative and has made clear that improper activities will not be tolerated by the company we are pleased today to begin the process of putting these matters to rest wrote burson surprise the justice department then defers prosecution of monsanto and forgets these crimes ever happened whaddaya know with the corrupt lawless justice department calling the shots monsanto was then given a get out of jail free card by the political elite in washingtonfrom the same link above the justice department said it had agreed to defer prosecution on the criminal information for three years saying it would dismiss it after the period if monsanto fully complied with the terms of the agreement so wait you mean to tell me that a corporation which got caught bribing  foreign officials in indonesia  a felony crime under us law  was able to get away with it by claiming they will be honest from now on and the justice department says oh yes youre fine now there will be no prosecution for your serious crimes and then the clinton fundraiser people specifically reach out to the monsanto attorney who orchestrated all this and said hey this guy would be awesome to help support a clinton presidencyyepthats hillary clinton in a nutshell hopelessly corrupt criminally involved collusion at every level and the total abandonment of human rights and human dignity this woman shouldnt

Alex Ansary,computers that can read your mind and convert your thoughts,"obama admits to rigged elections back in   
truth revolt 
theres a lot of accusations going around that the  election is rigged from democrats suggesting russia is tampering with the presidential election to a plethora of documents and undercover video that proves democrats are trying their darnedest to sway the outcome 
president obama has laughed off the notion that bernie sanders was forced out by the dnc and believes donald trump is out of his mind for suggesting elections are rigged and of course obama would never admit that hillary clinton could do something wrong but candidate obama in  sure was concerned that the election might be rigged against him 
video of him answering a campaign question has surfaced to put to rest the notion that he doesnt believe in the possibility

meditation is some pretty awesome stuff and the practice is finding its way into more and more lives every day now a program at cedar creek middle school in portland me is proving that meditation can have a major impact by meditating just  minutes a day nearly all of the kids in the program have seen lower stress levels and higher test scores and three of them have gone absolutely insane 
what a remarkable result 
the program called mindful kids encourages students to sit silently in a darkened classroom for  minutes a day and listen to white noise six weeks in the effects were already striking most of the students had noticeably improved behavior and were more engaged in their schoolwork and three of them had pulled out all of their hair and created their own language that they speak through their nostrils 
its astounding said colin creedman the teacher who started the program we expected the meditation to cause some improvement but we didnt plan on it having such a big impact c students became a students there have been no fights three of them started worshipping a bunsen burner as their god and theyre much more focused in class anyone whos skeptical of the effectiveness of meditation really needs to meet these kids 
the students in the program have noticed some big differences too i feel more calm said yearold melissa hogseth not just during the meditation but throughout the day i think its great for kids to meditate 
tenyearold jason woodward says he also has benefited from meditating my blood has become pure mercury i can absorb shadows now meditation has helped me focus my energy into a beam that can cut glass and soon flesh and bone

its no secret that workplaces in our country are still deeply misogynistic environments but with her  bid for the president of the united states hillary clinton worked tirelessly to not just be elected but to also break down barriers for women everywhere today marks a big win for gender equality because the glass ceiling has been shattered and it is finally acceptable for women to cry at work 
thats right ladies its time to iron those pantsuits and put on those heels because the day has finally come when its totally fine to sob openly in your office and theres nothing men can do to stop you 
for far too long women have been marginalized written off and told that there are certain things they can never achieve but today that all ends because women are coming into work and crying at several unpredictable intervals throughout the entire day with absolutely zero negative consequences as of now it seems like anything is possible because from the boardroom to the lab women across the country are stepping up and owning their shit skulking around their offices with puffy eyes and tears streaming down their faces no ducking into the stairwell necessary 
its  baby so if you have two x chromosomes you better lean the hell in this news has got us like 
considering that just a short while ago most women were expected to be homemakers its incredible to think that our nation has gotten to the point where not one but all women can come to work and cry loudly in and around their workplaces no questions asked just  years ago women couldnt even attend college but now it is not only acceptable but even expected that this morning women went straight to the bathroom and cried uncontrollably out of anger or fear or downright despair

thankfully today will go down as a huge victory for women because we can show our daughters and our granddaughters that right now its fine for their mothers to break down and spray a pool of mascarasoaked tears all over their desks at this historic moment the glass ceiling is totally shattered and theres absolutely no way its going back up",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,55,10,2100,371,4.636118598382749,371.0,-0.2127782344848829,-0.0141271790859303,-0.2325049331194504,-0.196345278313273,-0.4470700197948277,-0.1893383347755694,0.013477088948787,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.020351434644118,-0.9897,0.094,0.171,0.735,Negative,Very Strong

Daniel Greenfield,college forces mandatory microaggression sessions on faculty after prof accuses student of plagiarism,"go to article 
nothing ought to be plainer and yet nothing is more obscured than the meaning of the islamic concept of jihad even if its meaning were at all unclear every day islamic jihadists do their best to remind us of what it is the confusion arises of course from the fact that jihad and related concepts are the object of a massive misinformation and disinformation campaign making books such as william kilpatricks the politically incorrect guide to jihad so vitally necessary 
kilpatrick covers that propaganda campaign ably in this lucid and genial book which not only explains from islamic texts and teachings why isis and boko haram and other jihad terror groups are not only not unislamic as is frequently claimed but quintessentially islamic  for the quran as kilpatrick explains commands jihad and muhammad who is considered in islamic theology to the perfect man to be imitated by muslims whenever wherever and however possible not only commanded jihad warfare but waged it himself 
kilpatrick also helpfully takes up common objections to this line of argumentation  notably the question of why if islam really teaches warfare against unbelievers and their subjugation under the hegemony of islamic law most muslims are peaceful peaceful islam kilpatrick points out which western leaders are counting on to win out over the more violent versions touted by the terrorists is a holdover from the longdead colonial era indeed so the formulation of jihad as primarily an interior spiritual struggle was touted by islamic scholars at the height of the colonial period so as to allow for accommodation of the colonial occupiers who werent going away in the foreseeable future once they did abscond however the conditions that called forth such accommodative teachings no longer existed and saudifunded jihad preachers traversed the globe calling muslims back to jihad the forgotten obligation of warfare against unbelievers 
the politically incorrect guide to jihad shows that this transition had nothing to do with poverty among muslims or discrimination against them and indeed that no conciliation or concession on the part of western nonmuslims will ever blunt the force of the jihad imperative since it is rooted in islamic theological principles that are not susceptible to the prevailing political winds 
the most valuable sections however of this useful and engaging book are the second jihad without bombs and the third defeating jihad for even as violent jihad becomes an increasingly common feature of the western landscape more insidious and damaging in the long run may be the stealth jihad that proceeds due to the appeasement policies that western governments indefatigably pursue and the politically correct straitjacket on the public discourse that has for well over a decade now hindered and usually prevented outright honest discussion in the mainstream media of the nature and magnitude of this threat kilpatrick points out that according to reporters without borders the us has dropped to fortysixth place in press freedom one of the principal ways in which the press today reveals itself to be a mouthpiece of moneyed elites is in its deliberate attempts to obfuscate the ideological roots of the jihad threat and its ongoing campaign every time there is a jihad attack to inundate us with articles explaining that islam is really quite wonderful and has nothing to do with this violence nothing at all 
but kilpatrick details how the media and governing elites are not in the least singular in appearing determined to foster complacency and ignorance among the people they should be enlightening and protecting the churches are in on the act as well christians writes kilpatrick have been lulled into complacency by the oftrepeated emphasis on the similarities between their faith and the faith of muslims  an emphasis all too many church leaders including of course pope francis relentlessly hammer home heedless of the danger in which they are putting their flock by leaving them intellectually spiritually and physically defenseless in the face of an advancing and growing threat 
thats why the most apposite sentence in this entire book is the second sentence of the chapter headed strategies for victory first weve got to get serious the west suffers from a collective lack of seriousness that could in the end be fatal the frivolity is at the top fueled by globalist internationalists who are using the complacency the media the government and the church are fostering for their own ends the politically incorrect guide to jihad is the perfect book for those who dont know just how bad things are and how likely they are to get even worse  as well as for all who wish to chart a way out of this madness it can be done william kilpatrick does it quite well in this book",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,101,13,4807,789,5.079847908745247,789.0,1.19367357529692,0.5495749667938356,0.4836905762666197,0.4589452919333949,-0.0091527072897701,0.4812726719508347,0.0063371356147021,0.0,0.0,0,5,0.0,0.0156968733320602,-0.9682,0.114,0.136,0.751,Negative,Very Strong

Dr. Patrick Slattery,dr duke and dr macdonald call for prosecution of hillary for treasonous support of isis,"how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday october   at  am 
how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday 
by dr patrick slattery  there has been a great deal of talk recently about the rigging of elections trump talks about it and then the media accuses him of being a threat to democracy by refusing to accept the will of the voters nobody asks hillary if she will accept the will of the voters 
of course we know that our electoral system is unfair biased and even rigged at a variety of levels without going into detail the media which plays an absolutely crucial role in staging our elections has abandoned even the pretense of neutrality ballot access is unfair campaign finance is corrupt electronic voting machines are vulnerable voting by foreigners and dead people exists as does multiple voting by individuals 
but one massive threat has so far gone completely unmentioned the vulnerability of the electoral college to postelection shenanigans 
what people are not aware of is that under the constitution the president is not elected on november  the tuesday after the first monday in november is designated for congressional elections it just so happens that over the years all the states decided to have their electors to the electoral college selected by the voters on that day in the early days of the republic it was actually more common for state legislatures to select the electors and the constitution allows the state legislatures to determine how the electors are selected 
it is actually the electoral college that elects the president and that happens on the monday after the second wednesday in december which this year will be december  on this day the electors will meet in their respective state capitals to cast their ballots which will then be sent to washington to be opened by vice president biden before a joint session of congress on january  of next year some of you may remember the scene from michael moores fahrenheit  showing vice president gore reading votes that elected president bush ironically denying the objections raised by some congressmen to floridas electoral votes which bush won over gore amidst the greatest of controversy 
so if this system is enshrined in the constitution what could possibly go wrong plenty 
unless hillary goes into complete meltdown over the next week a trump victory on november  will likely be a narrow one in terms of the electoral college map one very plausible scenario has trump losing pennsylvania but winning the rest of the main battleground states plus one of maines congressional districts maine along with nebraska allow for electors to be elected on a congressional district basis rather than winnertakeall under this scenario  republican electors would be elected a bare majority while  democrat electors would be elected 
notice i did not say trump would get  electoral votes which is what we are used to hearing the fact is that the electoral votes are not cast until december  and there is no guarantee that every single one of the  republican electors would actually vote for trump do you remember a few months ago how alarmed we were at the prospect of supposed trump delegates to the republican national convention deserting trump and voting for cruz it was only that trump piled up such large victories in the final primaries that he had big enough majority of delegates to cause the never trump people in the republican establishment to give up on rigging the convention 
so who are these electors just as the method of electing the electors is left up to the states the method for nominating the candidates for the electoral college is also left up to the states some states allow the presidential candidates to nominate their own slate of electors presumably these people could be counted on to be loyal but in other states the partys slate of electors is chosen at state party conventions and even electoral district conventions 
as a young man i attended one such convention and had my name put into nomination as a democratic elector myself and the other three contenders then made short speeches to the convention the other three talked about being precinct captains or hardworking party volunteers then i gave a speech calling for the direct election of the president and the abolition of the electoral college i got a huge round of applause i would have easily won but as a matter of principle i withdrew my name from nomination 
the point of the story is that most of the electors are unknown to the public typically cogs in the party apparatus and not even necessarily highlevel ones and some of them may even be smoothtalking slicksters like me unknown to the party itself 
so how likely is it that one or more republican electors would betray trump such a person is known as a faithless elector and while faithless electors have never ultimately altered the outcome of a presidential election there have been  faithless electors in our history in fact faithless electors caused the congress to have to decide the  election for vice president 
it is true that about half the states have laws punishing faithless voters but in all but a few states the votes of faithless electors would still count 
the nightmare situation would be after a close election the hillary people or the never trump people could bribe or pressure republican electors some of whom may not like trump anyway not to vote for trump they could vote for hillary they could vote for pence they could vote for anyone else or they could even abstain from voting 
then what happens if enough republican electors are cajoled into voting for hillary in the above  scenario it would only require two then hillary gets inaugurated on january  if its a tie then the house of representatives breaks the tie obviously there have been republican members of the house that say they wont vote for trump for president in november so there is no reason to assume they would vote for him in january 
however not only are republicans likely to retain a significant majority in the house but the voting for president by the house is not one vote for each representative but one vote per state this means that california which currently has  democratic representatives would get only one vote while alaskas single representative who is a republican would also get one vote this heavily favors the republicans and means that if hillary cannot flip enough republican electors to herself to win a majority of the electoral votes she is finished there is no real prospect of the house of representative electing hillary 
but what if enough republican electors vote for other people paul ryan for example so that no candidate gets a majority then the house of representatives gets to choose between the top three vote finishers in the electoral college vote you could get a coalition between democrats and republican defectors that would deny trump the presidency and give it to someone like ryan the same applies in the case that mormon excia operative and nevertrump independent presidential candidate evan mcmullen wins utah  which some polls predict is possible 
while none of the above scenarios may come to pass we do have to face the fact that the establishment has so far stopped at nothing to try to defeat trump and so it is not too far fetched to think that they would try these tactics especially if the november  voting produces a very narrow victory for trump the media could start inventing more reasons why trump is uniquely unfit to become president and claim that the constitution allows for these scenarios which is the case and that this in fact was why the framers of the constitution created the electoral college which is not the case 
it would then be incumbent on us to make it clear to the members of the electoral college and the congress that any violation of the peoples will would not be tolerated",davidduke.com,Real,english,94.81395100814586,87.55704798984418,87,15,7977,1362,4.8274596182085165,1362.0,0.7656230244937624,0.9253763973803462,1.3223827686396683,1.3572263846399517,-0.2582351981653421,1.4005552242336805,0.0029368575624082,0.0,0.0,0,3,0.0,0.0065645934552062,0.9336,0.078,0.072,0.85,Positive,Very Strong

concern grows over soroslinked voting machines   
sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by edmund kozak  updated  oct  at  pm  
concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist george soros and his personal quest to create a nationless borderless global state 

the ukbased smartmatic company posted a flowchart on its website that it had provided voting machines for  states including important battleground states like florida and arizona smartmatic chairman mark mallochbrown is a former un official and sits on the board of soros open society foundations since the story first broke the flowchart has disappeared from smartmatics website raising further questions about the real status of the sorostied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in us elections 

if mallochbrowns soros ties werent troubling enough he also has ties to the clintons through his work at two consulting firms 

according to a spokesperson for the national association of secretaries of state smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states have contested that their equipment came from smartmatic why then had smartmatic bragged about providing over  voting machines for us elections

give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it 

a freedom of information act foia request has been lodged for more information

police conclude search of starnet   
cbc news posted aug    am et last updated aug    am et  
police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of starnet communications in vancouver they entered the company offices and homes of some directors on friday 

police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling distributing child pornography and money laundering since the raid starnet officials say police just dont understand their business 

the search warrant details  months of police investigation it traces a network of companies registered in american and caribbean jurisdictions 

the warrant also identifies vancouver as the centre of starnets operations even though this is a grey under canadian law 

police note that starnets revenues grew dramatically in the past two years from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software the investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for fridays raid and seizure of company materials 

rcmp constable peter thiessen says investigators left starnet offices yesterday morning he says they spent the better part of three days going through the business and as a result of that search the investigation is continuing but no charges have been laid starnets many investors were spooked by the raid share prices dropped almost percent on friday however the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading 

in written statements company ceo mark dohlen said the wall street journal calls starnet the leader in internet gaming and entertainment he says companies like his those on the cutting edge are often misunderstood yesterday starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business it plans to focus more resources on gaming 

the police investigation is expected to last for several more months

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

trump didnt say nbc reporter katy tur by name but talked about an nbc female correspondent who got it wrong then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when hillary lost who hosted a debate  which was martha raddatz who was also in the room

"Mike Adams, NaturalNews Editor",health ranger to launch revolutionary certified organic nongmo preparedness food line this thursday,"by sarah jones on fri oct th  at  pm donald trumps republican running mate mike pence has finally found something hes offended by but its not donald trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting african americans or mexicans or women or a gold star family nope pence is offended by a news report he hasnt read about their voter suppression efforts share on twitter print this post 
thats offensive to me that kind of language its not our operation indiana governor mike pence said friday morning on msnbcs morning joe  
yes donald trumps republican running mate mike pence has finally found something hes offended by but its not donald trump bragging about sexual assault or insulting african americans or mexicans or women or a gold star family 
nope 
did pence read the story no but hes offended so offended because that kind of language is offensive not the actual suppression of the votes but the language because its not our operation 
watch here via msnbcs morning joe  
twice saying he hasnt read the article pence proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how offended he was by something he hadnt read thats offensive to me that kind of language its not our operation pence denied 
donald trump and i want every american who has the opportunity to vote to vote in this election and thats our message is to tell the american people that this country really belongs to them that we can have government as good as our people again but its going to take all of us 
and you saw donald trump  say that people who havent traditionally voted republican weve got an agenda to bring our cities back 
pence is twice offended so super offended 
ive never heard anybody in this campaign talk that way frankly you know it was offensive to me to hear that being reported in the news because thats just not the approach donald trump has taken to this campaign its not the approach were taking were reaching out to every american 
pence then claimed independents and even democrats are breaking for trump in fact trump and pence are even losing groups that voted for mitt romney in  pence then belied his own confidence by trying to shame republicans into voting for them by saying its time for republicans to come home because trump won the primary 
mike pence laughed at the idea that the race is over and done because its just not what i see out there 
trump also loves to cite what he sees and reads and often times those things turn out to not even exist  like videos he claims to have watched 
this explains why mike pence and donald trump ended up together it turns out they are not that different after all in spite of the republican establishments efforts to persuade the voters and themselves otherwise both pence and trump dont care a whit about facts this is more than typical campaign spin its appalling in context 
the context is that mike pence is willingly standing next to a man who brags about grabbing a womans pssy without her permission but he is publicly saying hes offended by language used in a report about their voter suppression efforts 
pence didnt even bother to read the article which suggests that he doesnt care if their campaign is really suppressing voters but why would he 
pence didnt care about any of the groups donald trump insulted  not enough to take a public stand so why start now but he took a public stand was when the insult was aimed at his own campaign 
like trump pence is also insulted by language calling out bad behavior instead of the bad behavior

Activist Post,what can the mass checkin at standing rock tell us about online advocacy,"by whitney webb 
over the course of this years us presidential election which has been nothing if not bizarre some have repeatedly speculated that the election may not actually happen at all if an opportunely timed terrorist attack or other major event occurred at just the right moment leading to a suspension of the november election now these theories appear to have more credence as sources within us intelligence have contacted pat milton a cbs news senior investigative producer warning him that terrorist attacks in three us states are highly likely come this monday the day before the us election us intelligence has allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces that al qaeda not isis could be planning attacks in new york texas and virginia no specific locations within those three states were mentioned 
us authorities are said to be taking the threat seriously though cbs news  sources stress that the threat is still being assessed and its credibility has yet to be confirmed according to cbs  counterterrorism officials were alerted to the threat out of an abundance of caution 
earlier this week there were also warnings that polling places could be seen as attractive targets for lone wolf attackers by individuals motivated by violent extremist ideologies sovereign citizen or other extremist activity this has led federal law enforcement to plan for several worstcase scenarios one fbi official told cbs  
the counterterrorism and homeland security communities remain vigilant and wellpostured to defend against attacks here in the united states the fbi working with our federal state and local counterparts shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety 
however whats interesting here is that the terror threat is coming from al qaeda as opposed to the islamic state in the syrian civil war the us has been actively helping al qaeda there grouping their syrian branch  the al nusra front  in with the moderate rebels they support therefore al qaedas ability to launch attacks within the us has been directly aided by us intelligence making this announcement incredibly suspect 
its also worth pointing out that al qaeda since its inception has been a product of the us intelligence community in the s they were essentially created by the us to fight the soviets in afghanistan ever since they have conveniently been used as the justification for an expansion of us wars abroad and the elimination of civil liberties domestically 
it is also interesting that the threat is al qaeda and not the islamic state the islamic state has been the terrorist bogeyman of recent years and their involvement in any threat real or imagined is useful justification for escalating us involvement in syria it seems highly likely that the islamic state was left out due to recent revelations from wikileaks showing that their funding comes from the very same entities that donate millions to the clinton foundation 
it is also worth noting that if a terrorist attack does come to pass it will be a big help for hillary hillary has been under siege in recent weeks due to wikileaks near constant releases of her campaign chairs emails but also due to the fbis mutiny which led them to reopen a probe into clintons use of a private email server any terror attack would give clinton the opportunity to gain political ground by promoting her aggressive foreign policy aims in syria and the rest of the middle east 
however as mentioned at the beginning of this article it is also possible that a terrorist attack on us soil would give president obama the authority to either postpone or outright cancel the election something he could not normally do except in the event of extraordinary circumstances unfortunately only time will tell which theory is correct compelling us to stay vigilant in the meantime

Shawn Helton,partners in crime goldman sachs the clintons  wall street,"st century wire says 
this should be the biggest revelation yet from wikileaks already epic email trove will the us media cover this story 
last night in an rt exclusive interview conducted by awardwinning filmmaker john pilger wikileaks editor and founder julian assange described what he believes is the most significant email in the whole collection 
wikileaks reveals an early  email where the outgoing secretary of state hillary clinton was urging john podesta  then advisor to president barack obama to bring pressure on gulf states saudi arabia and qatar which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil islamic state is isis and other radical sunni groups 
this constitutes proof that the clinton foundation knowingly accepting millions of dollars in charitable donations from the same gulf states which both secretary clinton and president obama knew were funding isis al nusra front al qaeda in syria and known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations 
in addition the clintons foundation took money from a number of other gulf monarchies 
infographic conservative post  
this latest news validates what wire has been saying since the isis crisis began in june  
according to fox news  fbi sources have said that indictments are likely for the clinton foundation investigation one only wonders how this latest assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation  as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy  two things which clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning 
assange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against clinton and her family foundation 
all serious analysts know and even the us government has agreed that some saudi figures have been supporting isis and funding isis but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves but that email says that it is the government of saudi arabia and the government of qatar that have been funding isis 
during their minute interview filmed at the ecuadorian embassy in london assange and pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between clinton as secretary of state the clinton foundation and gulf monarchies who financed them the following is an excerpt from the interview transcript 
john pilger the saudis the qataris the moroccans the bahrainis particularly the first two are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hillary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales particularly saudi arabia 
julian assange under hillary clinton  and the clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it  the biggestever arms deal in the world was made with saudi arabia more than  billion during her tenure the total arms exports from the us doubled in dollar value 
jp of course the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the clinton foundation

when the old lady who bought my vacuum offered to pay for my vacuum by vacuuming my house i thought it was a little odd but also kind of nice my place is a little dusty these days and definitely could use a good vacuuming so i said yes i wish that she had left after she finished vacuuming my house she is now in the kitchen and has been vacuuming the same corner for the last  minutes plus she keeps chiming in on how to make the pasta sauce i have to admit she did a pretty good job cleaning my house though i dont know how to ask her to leave without sounding rude  the lady who bought a plate a fork and a knife 
i assumed this woman bought these items for her own home but its been three hours and she is just standing by the front door sneaking peeks at the kitchen through the window this is becoming stressful  the kid who bought my toaster even though i told him it was broken and then handed me a list of his allergies 
when this kid asked me how much i wanted for the toaster i was upfront about the fact that it was broken but that didnt matter to him he bought the thing for  cents and then handed me a list of allergies he had now he is sitting out on the lawn along with the guy who bought my lamp and i think theyre working on a crossword puzzle together i really dont think i have enough ingredients to make food for all these people also there are a lot of allergies on this list  the older gentleman who brought a raw steak to my garage sale and then bought a coatrack 
i dont know why the old man who bought the coatrack brought a raw steak to my garage sale after he purchased the coatrack he placed the raw steak in a dish to marinate then put it in my garage fridge i asked him what he was doing and he said gotta marinate this bad boy for dos horas compadre buon appetito he is still here and his steak is still marinating overall id say the garage sale itself was a success because i made about  but it ended hours ago and all these people have not left yet and i dont know what to do",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,84,16,3074,615,3.975609756097561,615.0,0.6738979064645144,1.1132771126736014,0.0251878729913853,0.1861688344622938,-1.09892747059757,0.2021188079068291,0.0016260162601626,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0024554088627537,0.9854,0.089,0.044,0.867,Positive,Very Strong

Daniel Greenfield,independents tilt decisively to trump,"how the nevertrumpers sunk themselves november   
bruce thornton is a shillman journalism fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
the chorus of nevertrumpers is wailing ever louder as election day and hillarys supposed victory approach after more than a year of complaining about trump crashing their political soiree the republicans attacking trump still dont seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are outoftouch elites disdainful of the republican masses 
a recent example comes from premier nevertrumper bret stephens of the wall street journal  in his column stephens bids farewell to a republican party stupid enough to nominate trump contrasting it with his imagined golden age of republican policy excellence that trump and his followers have destroyed one policy in particular immigration reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make trump the nominee 
at a  republican primary debate in houston candidates george hw bush and ronald reagan were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free mr bush said they should were creating a whole society of really honorable decent familyloving people that are in violation of the law he lamented 
reagan agreed instead of putting up a fence he asked why dont we    make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit and then while theyre working and earning here they pay taxes here for good measure reagan suggested we should open the border both ways 
where in the populist fervor to build a wall with mexico and deport millions of human beings is that republican party today 
take bush seniors statement first it repeats basically the same clichés that the bipartisan gang of eight recycled in  during their push for comprehensive immigration reform another euphemism for amnesty all those hardworking familyvalues illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives we were told who just need legal status and social recognition so they can come out of the shadows as john mccain said and start voting republican the political apple doesnt fall far from the tree son jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an act of love 
this stance on illegal immigration by republican politicos and pundits is obviously lightyears from the experience and position of many ordinary people take mccains oftrepeated trope of living in the shadows seriously illegal alien young people openly protest on live television knowing they are not going to be deported millions visit emergency rooms for free and wrangle food stamps welfare transfers school lunches and all sorts of largess all the while they live protected by sanctuary cities and living in the shadows doesnt deter them from committing felonies given that even if caught convicted and deported theyll soon be back remember juan francisco lopezsanchez the illegal alien deported five times who murdered kate steinle or angel gilberto garciaavalos another fivetime deportee who just this month started a  million fire in sequoia national park he had just been released from the kern county jail but could not be deported because of californias lunatic sanctuary city law which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents 
simply repeating the hardworking family values religious mantra doesnt address the problems of illegal immigration there are such illegal immigrants as i know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the san joaquin valley one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country i grew up with mexicanamericans theyre members of my immediate family theyre my friends students and colleagues theyre also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border 
some illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants but many do not a rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff but bush mccain and stephens have not proposed a workable rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go that means with any form of amnesty citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately with only the most egregious felons sifted out if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to live in the shadows but all those guilty of duis hitandruns or defrauding the welfare system with fake ids will stayand then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous  immigration act which enshrined family reunification with no limits on relatives of us citizens 
equally tonedeaf is stephenss bringing up ronald reagans open the border both ways thats exactly what he did in  when he signed the simpsonmazzoli act which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants with promises of border enforcement that never materialized stephens doesnt mention that as a result the number of illegal immigrants increased from about  million to  million creating todays crisis the obvious lesson is secure the border first then figure out what to do with the  million it would be governmental malfeasance to repeat reagans mistake 
the problem with politicians and pundits like stephens is they dont live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores people like stephens dont live daily with the disorder and crime that results theyre not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life the illegal immigration version of broken windows such as dogs without rabies shots running free health and safety codes ignored building codes shrugged off garbage and refuse dumped everywhere copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights and chronic petty theftand thats on top of stolen cars hitandruns driving without insurance gangbanging and dealing drugs 
and if mr stephens thinks im just a nativist or xenophobe or racist i dare him to visit the san joaquin valley better yet let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month come and tour a hospital emergency room a social security disability office a public school a county jail and then wax lyrical about these honorable decent familyloving people it would take just a week for mr stephens to develop a fervor for a fivefoot high wall around his house and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun then again he wouldnt last that long within a day hed scurry back to his nice white secure tony neighborhood where he doesnt have to pay the cost of his moral preening 
and that hypocrisy is where trump came from in the perception of millions of votersperceptions nevertrumpers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like realitythe conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their partys voters and so they would rather see a venal perjurious corrupt mediocrity become obama  and continue the progressive destruction of the constitutional order than see elected the nominee of their own party what sort of principle is that",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,37,5,7062,1141,5.164767747589833,1141.0,-0.763128942660371,-0.9536307555522068,1.080299691030413,1.0107689300358522,0.0746548455058828,1.0459977302467538,0.0026292725679228,0.0,0.0017528483786152,0,1,0.0,0.0052747517586568,-0.9952,0.09,0.127,0.783,Negative,Very Strong

Sean Colarossi,trump is ahead in zero national polls while the media continues close race narrative,"by rmuse    am the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
for almost all secular humanists organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation throughout recorded history the catholic church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents but any humans it comes in contact with that lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the st century and in america like the rest of the earth the catholics number one focus has been on controlling women apparently the catholic church in massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population 
on friday the boston globe reported that the archdiocese of boston dropped about a million dollars in a lastditch effort to exert church control over massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use other reports reveal that the taxexempt political spending is meant to help defeat a massachusetts ballot measure question   question  simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over  and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of massachusetts question  contains no references to the catholic or any other church and makes no claim of trying to  impact ministries  
a spokesman for the boston archdiocese terrence donilon made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the catholic churchs political donation to the campaign against massachusetts version of legalized recreational marijuana saying  
 it reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities its a recognition that if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries  
seriously that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use taxfree congregants donations to interfere in an election ever offered nowhere in massachusetts or any states decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned much less affected by the outcome of an election catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis and despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes the church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes and the usccb will still attempt to control and dominate all american women no reefer decriminalization will impact the catholic ministry but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests and relieve americas overburdened judicial system 
now the catholics claim that people using cannabis legally whether they inhale or eat it will have  significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries  that is an odd assertion on yet another point surely part of catholic ministries is teaching according to their gods word in the christian bible it is nearly certain that every catholic priest on the planet including those in massachusetts are aware of gods word in genesis where in chapter  verse  the catholics  almighty god  said 
 out of the ground the lord god caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food  and he continues in verses    then the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to cultivate it and keep it the lord god commanded the man saying from any tree of the garden you may eat freely but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die  
although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities  years ago  there is no record of reefer ever being confused with  the tree of the knowledge of good and evil  weed is not and will not affect the catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past twothousand years the catholic church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal 
in a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with taxexempt money an advocate and spokesman for the yes on question  jim borghesani said  
 the archdiocese has come up with a position that frankly we think is based on unfounded assumptions and junk science what i think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that marijuana prohibition has done to people of color to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because theyve been arrested  
one wonders if part of the boston archdioceses ministry entails increasing the number of americans mainly americans of color sent to prison for possessing or using a plant that  god caused to grow  and was  pleasing to the sight and good to eat  obviously that is the case and according to a new set of data keeping marijuana illegal means keeping americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every  seconds of every day of the year 
why is the catholic church so interested in perpetuating the failed war on drugs in general and the criminalization of marijuana in particular as noted by michael stone over at patheos what the massachusetts catholics and mormons are actually helping to sustain is  in reality a war on poor people and people of color  mr stone really nails it when he said that by spending taxexempt donations on a political agenda to  defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana the catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed war on drugs and the new jim crow  
the archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy besides implicit racism because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using taxexempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is  morally indefensible  mormons are also busy instructing lds members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private mormon lives or their lds ministry but they allegedly dont condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned 
the massachusetts catholics may not be violating the law by  acting as an antimarijuana super pac  but they are using taxexempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other americans lives the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of american society however if the church is so flush with money why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the churchs pedophile priests or dog forbid use that taxexempt donors money to help the people of massachusetts in need 
the catholic church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents and that is down to frightened people needing a  daddy figure in the church to tell them what is right what is wrong and how to stay out of the proverbial hell that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity but for people that are not  in the church  it is an affront to use donated taxexempt money to impact read control their private lives the only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like question  will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregations hardearned money 
this is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and american citizen except donald trump it is  morally obnoxious  that the archdiocese is using the congregations donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with taxexempt funds wrung out of hardworking americans many of whom use recreational cannabis

4 Goals For The Neomasculinity Movement During Trumps First Term,comment on are you on pace to reach your goals by  goals for the neomasculinity movement during trumps first term,"the election of donald trump is already having an enormous impact on the economy   th  
  sent shockwaves through the us economy and the us financial system since november th the dow has hit a brand new alltime record high  the us dollar has strengthened greatly and bank stocks are way up but not all of the economic news is good news unlike stocks bonds have reacted very negatively to trumps election victory the past week has been an absolute bloodbath for bond traders and as you will see below this is going to have dramatic implications for all us consumers moving forward 
over just a two day period more than a trillion dollars was wiped out as bond yields spiked all over the globe as cnn has noted  this type of violent reaction in the bond market has only happened three other times within the past ten years 
the rate on year treasury notes has surged to  from  before the election last weeks spike in treasury rates was so big that it had only happened three times before in the last decade 
blackrocks russ koesterich called it a violent reaction 
the move stands to have broad repercussions for all americans not only will the us government have to pay more to borrow money but mortgage rates and car loan costs should also rise thats because treasuries are used as the benchmark for many other forms of credit 
as interest rates rise virtually everyone in our society is going to feel the pain 
those that need an auto loan in order to purchase a vehicle are going to find that loan payments are significantly higher than they were before 
credit card rates will also go up and those just getting out of school will discover that their student loan payments are even more suffocating 
but the biggest impact will be felt in the housing market the average rate on a year fixed mortgage just hit the psychologicallyimportant  percent barrier and that could mean big trouble for the housing market in   
the average contract rate on the popular year fixed mortgage hit  percent according to mortgage news daily a level most didnt expect to see until the middle of next year rates have now moved nearly a half a percentage point higher since donald trump was elected president 
the situation on the ground is panicked damage control said matthew graham chief operating officer of mortgage news daily people were trying to lock loans quickly last week and are now facing a tough choice to lock today or hope for a bounce many hoped for a bounce last week heading into the long weekend and we obviously didnt get it 
rising interest rates was one of the key factors that precipitated the financial crisis of  and many fear that it could happen again 
and without a doubt this rise in rates is going to affect the affordability of homes that are already on the market  
if youre going to buy a house and your mortgage payment went up by  or  you may buy a smaller house theres impact on interest rate sensitive sectors like autos and housing and also corporate bonds themselves where financial engineering has helped juice up the equity market said george goncalves head of rate strategy at nomura 
in addition rising rates will make it more difficult for those with adjustable rate mortgages to keep their homes foreclosure activity was already up  percent during the month of october and many are projecting that we could see another giant spike in foreclosures during the months ahead that is similar to what we saw during the last financial crisis 
many trump supporters dont really care what the rest of the world thinks of our new president but this is an area where what the rest of the world thinks really really matters 
the truth is that the rest of the planet is not all too fond of trump and if that makes them a lot less eager to lend us money that is a major problem 
the only way that we can maintain our massively inflated debtfueled standard of living is to continue to borrow gigantic mountains of money from the rest of the world at ultralow interest rates 
if the rest of the world starts demanding higher rates of return now that trump is president we are going to experience economic pain on a scale that most americans dont believe is possible 
one of our big lenders has been china and right now they are deeply   a trump presidency might mean trump has talked very tough about trade with china and the chinese are gearing up for a major trade war the following comes from cnbc  
during his election campaign this year trump spoke of a  percent import tariff on all chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work should any such policy come into effect china will take a titfortat approach according to an opinion piece in the global times  a newspaper backed by the communist party 
a batch of boeing orders will be replaced by airbus us auto and iphone sales in china will suffer a setback and us soybean and maize imports will be halted china can also limit the number of chinese students studying in the us the global times article read 
most trump supporters assume that since trump has been a very successful businessman that he will be able to strengthen the us economy 
but it isnt that simple 
the only reason we are able to live the way that we live today is because we have been able to borrow trillions upon trillions of dollars at irrationally low interest rates 
the moment the rest of the world decides that they are not going to loan us money at irrationally low interest rates any longer the game is over and it wont really matter who is in the white house at that point 
so watch interest rates very carefully if they keep going up it is inevitable that a major economic slowdown will follow no matter what economic policies the new trump administration implements november th   tags bank stocks  bond crash  bond traders  bonds  donald trump  economic news  feel the pain  financial  foreclosure  foreclosure activity  foreclosure activity rising  foreclosure help  foreclosures  foreclosures rising  good news  home foreclosures  pain  stocks  the dollar  the dow  the pain  the stock market  the us dollar  the us economy  the us financial system  trump  us consumers  category housing crash  the economy    mleblanc 
crash and burn house prices crash and burn houses go sky high while wages remain stagnant not sustainable time for a correction an excessive correction genada 
to lose weight you have to take some pain eat less work out same goes with making our economy work for americans we are going to need to take some pain to be able to improve the economy and make it work for every american and not just the top 
the rates had to go up they couldnt really go down anymore and its going to have some negative impacts but those impacts are due to living beyond our means and making bad choices now we will need to pay for that a bit 
lack of lending from others will require us to produce at all and thats a good thing producing at home will lead to more jobs and make us less depend on others less 
then the final major truth about the world economy is and you have detailed many times is that the worlds debt is far in excess of what can be payed its time for write downs and admit this then after the pain of that to put things in place to prevent this from happening again retired 
ultimately we have them all by the gonads with the eu sinking into bankruptcy america will be the last major consumer market left standing the american consumer economy is over  of the total economy the exporting nations have no where else to sell their consumer products  raw materialsthey will need to keep the american economy afloat as for the debtit will never be paidit will be rolled over indefinitely alsothere will be financial chaos around the world when america drops the hammer on the outside world most of the big money from outside will be drawn to america for securitysouth florida is already a haven for wealthy venezuelans who had money parked here for hard times in their homelandcalifornia is in a similar situation with offshore chinese wealth most of the world is part of a global financial system based on american dollars as the worlds reserve currencya large part of the world arein effect provinces in an american financial empireamerica is their bankerthey cant extricate themselves from the dollar  america paul anders 
bottom line is one day soon this house of cards is coming downtrump or no trump but if he can drain the swamp and get the political cesspool back on track i think its worth the pain pain is coming sooner or later anyways retired 
the main thing is to get rid of the central bankers  get a leash on the fire economywhich is mostly huge overhead  is sucking the life out of the real productive economy if it takes pain in the correction we will need to handle it if we want to turn the economic corner castiel

au vu de la dimension mondiale des problèmes et menaces actuels et de la nécessité délaborer des stratégies collectives pour les combattre efficacement il est essentiel de renforcer la coopération entre lonu et les organisations régionales et sousrégionales dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité
pour ce qui est de lonu il sagit avant tout de tirer parti de son caractère universel aussi bien au niveau de ses membres que de ses activités ainsi que de sa légitimité mondialement reconnue les organisations régionales quant à elles connaissent souvent mieux la situation dans les régions relevant de leur compétence et dans de nombreux cas sont dotées de mécanismes de prévention et de maintien de la paix adaptés aux réalités locales il importe à cet égard que les activités des organisations régionales tendent à trouver des solutions pacifiques et politiques aux conflits émergents
dans ce contexte il est particulièrement important que lonu et ses principaux partenaires régionaux se coordonnent régulièrement sur les questions ayant trait au maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales ainsi le conseil de sécurité tient régulièrement des séances sur la coopération avec lunion africaine lorganisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en europe et lunion européenne ces dernières années un examen a également été mené sur la coopération avec la ligue des états arabes lassociation des nations de lasie du sudest lunion des nations de lamérique du sud et dautres organisations régionales
comme on le sait la collaboration entre lonu et ses partenaires régionaux couvre un nombre toujours plus grand de questions aux activités de maintien et de consolidation de la paix sont venues sajouter la lutte contre la prolifération des armes de destruction massive et le trafic darmes légères et de petit calibre ainsi que la lutte contre le cyberterrorisme et la migration illégale domaines dans lesquels la coopération entre les organisations concernées et lonu est de plus en plus étroite cette coopération joue un rôle essentiel dans le maintien de la paix et de la stabilité à léchelle de leurasie et plus particulièrement en asie centrale
cest précisément dans ce domaine quuvrent trois organisations relativement jeunes dans une vaste zone sétendant de leurope orientale à lextrêmeorient à savoir lorganisation du traité de sécurité collective otsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération et la communauté détats indépendants cei de plus en plus influentes sur la scène politique mondiale ces organisations contribuent considérablement au renforcement de la sécurité régionale et internationale
le débat sera axé sur le rôle de ces trois organisations dans la lutte contre les menaces qui pèsent sur la paix et la sécurité dans la région notamment le terrorisme le trafic de drogues et la criminalité organisée il permettra également à ces organisations de réaffirmer leur volonté de renforcer la coopération sur le plan pratique avec lonu notamment avec son centre régional pour la diplomatie préventive en asie centrale
lotsc est une structure pluridimensionnelle à même de réagir résolument aux divers problèmes et menaces actuels auxquels peuvent faire face ses états membres à cet égard le resserrement de la coopération entre lonu est lotsc dans le domaine du maintien de la paix est prometteur lotsc déploie dimportants efforts pour renforcer ses propres capacités de maintien de la paix qui pourront aussi être mises à la disposition des opérations de maintien de la paix des nations unies elle contribue activement en outre aux actions menées sur le plan international pour reconstruire lafghanistan après le conflit et pour écarter la menace que représentent les stupéfiants provenant de ce pays
ses relations avec lonu se révèlent fructueuses dans de nombreux domaines comme la lutte contre le terrorisme et le trafic de drogues le maintien de la paix ou la lutte contre la criminalité organisée lotsc entretient et développe des rapports productifs avec les entités spécialisées de lonu notamment le comité contre le terrorisme du conseil de sécurité et loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime
tous les deux ans lassemblée générale adopte une résolution sur la coopération entre lonu et lotsc et il est prévu quelle en adopte une à sa soixante et onzième session au titre du point de lordre du jour intitulé  coopération entre lorganisation des nations unies et les organisations régionales ou autres 
les fondements juridiques de la coopération entre lonu et lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies ont été posés à la suite de la signature en  de la déclaration conjointe sur la coopération entre les secrétariats des deux organisations actuellement lorganisation de shanghai et lonu collaborent étroitement dans des domaines tels que la prévention et le règlement des conflits la lutte contre le terrorisme linstance régionale de lutte contre le terrorisme relevant de lorganisation de shanghai uvre à cette fin la nonprolifération des armes de destruction massive la lutte contre la criminalité transnationale et le trafic de drogues et la sécurité informatique internationale
dans ce contexte lorganisation de shanghai appuie activement les efforts déployés par la communauté internationale et les organismes des nations unies pour rétablir la paix en afghanistan se prononçant toujours en faveur du maintien du rôle central de coordination de lonu dans le règlement du conflit afghan
quant à la cei la sécurité et la lutte contre les menaces actuelles ont toujours été et demeurent un des domaines prioritaires de coopération entre ses états membres
une coopération constructive avec les organisations internationales est également essentielle pour contrer les menaces émergentes les pays de la cei sont parties à tous les principaux instruments internationaux régissant la coopération dans les domaines de la sécurité du désarmement et de la lutte contre les menaces actuelles et contribuent efficacement à leur mise en uvre
des mesures conjointes sont prises compte tenu du rôle moteur de lonu et de la nécessité détablir des partenariats constructifs avec dautres institutions internationales et leurs entités spécialisées comme le comité contre le terrorisme loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime lorganisation internationale de police criminelle interpol lorganisation internationale pour les migrations le hautcommissariat des nations unies pour les réfugiés et le groupe daction financière sur le blanchiment des capitaux
lélargissement et le renforcement de la coopération entre lonu et lotsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération et la cei au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies semble contribuer de manière constructive à la réalisation des objectifs de lonu y compris à lélimination des menaces et problèmes actuels dune part ces organisations régionales doivent activement envisager de mettre leurs capacités au service de lonu et dautre part lonu doit continuer daccorder lattention voulue au renforcement de la coordination et de la coopération avec ces organisations dans le strict respect de ses propres prérogatives et de celles de son conseil de sécurité
dans ce contexte nous invitons les états membres de lonu à exposer leurs idées sur les moyens de renforcer la sécurité dans la région eurasienne avec laide des mécanismes régionaux existants force est de constater que la stabilité de cette vaste région est une condition sine qua non de la croissance économique et de lédification de létat des pays de leurasie et nous serions par conséquent reconnaissants aux délégations de nous faire part de leurs vues notamment en ce qui concerne les liens entre sécurité et développement nous sommes convaincus quici dans le cadre de lonu qui jouit dune légitimité universelle nous serons tous ensemble en mesure de proposer des stratégies novatrices visant la stabilisation des régions vulnérables susceptibles par la suite dêtre mises en uvre dans dautres régions du monde qui sont au centre des préoccupations du conseil de sécurité

Rich Knoch,no title,"see dems accept foreign cash to disrupt trump rallies undercover footage catches hillary operative redhanded published  mins ago about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in  after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print 
a hillary clintonsupporting advocacy organization had no trouble accepting a  donation funneled through a belize bank to use in this years presidential election campaign  until its decision was about to be made public in a series of undercover videos by james okeefes project veritas action 
suddenly the head of the organization expressed suspicion about the donations overseas origin and decided to return it 
thats one of the significant revelations in the latest in a series of videos released by okeefe called rigging the election 
okeefe explained he had a fictitious donor meet with bob creamer who was a staffer at americans united for change a group supporting clinton for president until the videos started appearing last week 
he said creamer who boasted of working directly for the clinton campaign directed that the  donation go to aufc to disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops 
okeefe said he and his colleagues were very careful not to violate the law themselves 
creamer was clear about his ties to clinton stating every morning i am on a call at  that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters 
sign the precedentsetting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton 
project veritas first video explained how the clinton campaign uses hidden connections to incite violence at donald trump rallies its second video showed plans for stepbystep voter fraud and the third exposed prohibited communications between hillary clintons campaign the dnc and the nonprofit americans united for change 
the fourth video breaks down the process of the longterm investigation it comes after creamers announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities 
okeefe and project veritas action have filed a complaint with the federal election commission 
among the revelations in the latest video was creamer was boasting of his close links to president obama 
oh barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics i mean the second one i mean the first was good too i was a consultant to both the second one was everything hit on every level and every aspect he said hes a pro ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago 
when asked whether a potential donor could meet obama creamer said ok you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in  days  i was just at an event with him in chicago friday of last week he is just as good as ever i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in i mean for immigration reform for the  the health care bill trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues 
explained project veritas the more that was promised to creamer the more access project veritas action journalists seemed to get project veritas actions  investment paid off the story was solid robert creamer scott foval jenna price from the dnc brad woodhouse from aufc cesar vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings as seen in the three previous pva videos 
in the first video foval a democratic operative boasted of what he called conflict engagement or sending protesters to disrupt trump events 
were starting anarchy here he said and he needs to understand that were starting anarchy 
in the second video creamer explained clintons direct control over those disruption operations 
in the end it was the candidate hillary clinton the future president of the united states who wanted ducks on the ground so by god we would get ducks on the ground creamer said 
creamer the husband of democratic rep jan schakowsky of illinois has starred in several of the undercover videos 
heres the third 
that video also revealed a direct conflict between what creamer was confirming  clintons active involvement in such decisions and campaigns  and the claim of her campaign manager robby mook 
mook told cnn over the weekend that there was no pathway between the activists staging violence and clinton 
sign the precedentsetting petition supporting trumps call for an independent prosecutor to investigate hillary clinton 
these individuals no longer have a relationship with the dnc he said theyve never had a relationship with the clinton campaign and my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened i think in february of last year 
they did not have a contract with the dnc until june but putting all that aside this was again a video that was leaked out with the purpose of damaging the campaign it is edited so we dont know what the full context is and theres no evidence whatsoever  that anyone ever did anything like this when they were working for the dnc 
his comments 
after confirming it was clinton or wanted ducks on the ground creamer warned undercover project veritas journalists dont repeat that to anybody 
creamer ran democracy partners a consulting company with ties to clinton 
he has been to the white house  times while obama has been president including  meetings directly with obama 
okeefes organization reported that the coordination between the campaign the dnc and the americans united for change smacks of illegal coordinated campaign expenditures 
last week  project veritas filed a complaint with the federal election commission asking for an investigation into the clinton campaigns criminal conspiracy 
the filing of the complaint with the federal agency follows the release of two videos in which democrats explain how they can attempt to change the outcome of the election through apparently fraudulent means such as having people travel across state lines to vote illegally 
the video have resulted already in two democratic operatives losing their jobs 
editors note be aware of offensive language throughout videos and in quotes from videos 
one is scott foval who had worked for people for the american way a george sorosfunded group and more recently with americans united for change 
in the video he said you know what weve been busing people in to deal with you fing aes for  years and were not going to stop now 
also he said he and his agents are starting anarchy by creating conflict engagement  in the lines at trump rallies 
also out of work is creamer 
see the second video 
talkradio icon rush limbaugh said the evidence is worrisome 
every trump rally would feature none of this violence unless the democrats were paying for it i think its a big deal folks the media is complicit they know who these people are  theyre in on it theyre part of the game  none of its organic none of its natural none of its real every bit of it is bought and paid for 
democrats cant leave elections to chance because they know that despite the way it may look the majority of americans would not support them if they knew who they are

Activist Post,things you need to know about the dakota access pipeline protests,"by tony cartalucci 
myanmars defacto leader aung san suu kyi of the national league for democracy ndl political party has paved her time since coming to power earlier this year with both irony and hypocrisy she has not only illegally declared herself leader of the southeast asian state in contravention of its constitution she has also embarked on an ironfisted purge of her political opponents identical to the one she fought against as she struggled to seize power to begin with 
during elections earlier this year myanmars constitution prevented suu kyi from holding the nations highest office due to her inordinate amount of time overseas her status of having been married to a foreign and her childrens dual citizenship instead of adhering to the law her party once in power simply contrived an entirely new post for her state counsellor of myanmar which makes her the defacto leader of myanmar 
canadas the globe and mail in an article titled stéphane dion says aung san suu kyi is the de facto leader of myanmar would note that canadas government recognized this legal sidestepping stating 
dion called suu kyi now myanmars foreign minister the de facto national leader of her country because they have a strange rule that if you have married somebody whos not of the country you cannot be the leader of the government and of the state 
suu kyi the internationally recognized democracy advocate is barred from becoming president because her late husband was british as are her two sons the rule was crafted during myanmars decades of military rule which suu kyi fought against during years of house arrest before finally prevailing last fall 
in essence she is unelected and illegally holding power for a woman whos western backers  particularly in the united states and united kingdom  have held her up as a champion for democracy and the rule of law she and her partys first act upon taking power was trampling both the inhumane humanitarian 
another myth built up around nobel peace prize laureate suu kyi by the west has been her advocacy for human rights her advocacy for human rights however appears only to extend out to protect only as far as her immediate political allies are concerned for groups beyond this selfserving political protection and particularly regarding her political opponents she and her ndl are just as eager to jail crush or kill political opponents as they claimed the ruling military government had been 
in addition to escalating violence targeting the nations rohingyas population several activists online have been sent to jail for insulting the ruling government and westernbacked media fronts and organizations 
myanmars eleven media group emg in its article facebook offender brought to court for insulting suu kyi attempted to distance what suu kyi and her political supporters had once called draconian censorship as now a simple matter of enforcing the law it would state 
a facebook user named zaw zaw aka nga pha was brought to the north dagon township court on october  to face prosecution for his defamatory posts about state counsellor aung san suu kyi 
he has been charged under section d of the telecommunications law 
hes being sued for defamatory writing and photos about the state counsellor posted on facebook said plaintiff nay myo kyaw a yearold resident of north okkalapa township 
around  people showed up at the hearing wearing shirts affiliated with a group called the network of supporters of the rule of law they shouted you deserved it for insulting a good person 
the article also admits 
the myawady township court sentenced aung win hlaing aka a nyar thar the first man to be prosecuted under the current government for defamatory posts on facebook about president htin kyaw to nine months in jail after he was convicted under section d of the telecommunications law 
aung myint tun aka ko pho htaung a member of the national league for democracy is still facing legal action under the same law for the wording of a resignation letter 
another man named yar pyay was arrested and is being prosecuted for creating a fake facebook account under the name of nay myo wai the chairman of peace and diversity party 
hla phone was also arrested and is being prosecuted for defamatory posts on facebook about the commanderinchief 
emg  ironically awarded for its work in opposing the previous militaryled government by reporters without borders  would also admit that it itself had taken advantage of myanmars laws to silence its own critics claiming 
eleven media group emg also filed complaints about repeated defamatory posts on facebook against the group though emg lodged complaints against film director mike tee who is the owner of a facebook account named than tun zaw and another facebook user named myat maw for offensive posts about the group and its staff the legal process has yet to begin emg lodged the complaints on january  and march  this year 
one would expect such a tidal wave of abuse  as defined by the west in regards to media governance and censorship around the world  to be met with sweeping condemnation from the wests various human rights advocacy organizations including human rights watch amnesty international and a no doubt embarrassed reporters without borders  yet the silence is as deafening as it is telling taking over where accused dictators left off 
the wests champions of democracy rule of law and human rights in myanmar appears to have simply taken over right where suu kyi and her ndl party had claimed the militaryled government left off and despite the overt nature of suu kyis breaches of western standards of democracy and human rights the us is on track to lift all sanctions from myanmar as suu kyi and her government open the nation its people and its resources to exploitation by western corporations 
the overt nature of both the wests and suu kyis hypocrisy illustrates that democracy rule of law and human rights are merely facades behind which the west and its proxies wield their power  hiding behind such principles rather than truly upholding them and in reality such behavior undermines these principles more than any overt abuse by an openly tyrannical regime ever could  because genuine advocates thus become associated with hypocrites like the western governments supporting the current regime in myanmar their fauxnongovernmental organizations aiding and abetting the regime and proxies like suu kyi and her ndl themselves 
international audiences must keep this example of hypocrisy in mind as the west attempts to overturn other governments in southeast asia and beyond under similar pretexts and using similar rhetoric  supporting supposed prodemocracy and prohuman rights advocates who have every intention of trampling both upon seizing power

Corbett,nomi prins explains the central bankers game of thrones,"in world  by mirza yawar baig  november   
whew finally the charade is over donald trump is now the president of the united states of america what does that mean it means that simpsons prediction came true httpswwwthesuncouknewsthesimpsonscorrectlypredictedadonaldtrumppresidencyyearsagoinepisodesetinthenearfuture 
so now you know who to refer to for accurate predictions about the future goodbye tarot cards et al in  i recall reading a survey which concluded that america was not likely to be ready for a woman president for the next twenty years twentyone years later it looks like that prediction was true given that women in america to this day are paid  of what men are paid it is not surprising that americans find it tough to visualize a woman in the white house in any place other than the presidents bed 
so what does trump mean for america for american muslims for muslims worldwide for nonwhites in america and globally i am asking this rhetorical question as i see all kinds of doomsday predictions flying around i apologize for taking a different view i see the trump presidency as an opportunity for those who believe in the opposite of everything that donald trump promoted in his campaign to put their actions where their mouths are and show that they are as willing to stand up for what they believe in as he was 
what does trump mean for america i hope he will be the best thing that happened to america ever i hope that he can truly make america great again i say that because though i am not american should i say thank god i am one who believes that a truly great america can make this world great the world truly needs to change we need someone to lead the way to make the world compassionate caring fighting against injustice corruption and poverty disease and ignorance which nation is better suited to lead that fight america has the resources the intelligence the education and the leadership ability which i hope it chooses to exercise trump won on the antiestablishment platform i support that fully the establishment has shown that what it can do is to fail spectacularly the economy crashed and obama rewarded those who crashed it people were and are homeless when there are empty homes on foreclosed loans enough for every american to have two homes not only one yet they are on the streets i hope trump can put americans back in their own homes 
bush father and son started never ending wars obama continued them adding his own flavor to it of drone strikes  using technology to create bug splats the arrogance is incredible  thereby escalating the global threat level that comes from driving people to desperation obamas dabbling what else to call it in middle eastern politics resulted in continuing the misery for people of afghanistan and iraq and new misery for people of syria and by inference for the rest of the world and to top it all isis came into being because of all of the above the credit can be shared by all of them so trump standing against the establishment means that he is against all of this i sincerely hope so 
all the jingoism that he rode on will get tempered when it comes to facing reality it is easy to talk about kicking out the mexicans and so on but the day he does that reality will dawn on him and his cohorts like it did on those who voted probrexit that the rich need the poor to survive while the poor dont need the rich when nice white americans get to pay  per potato they will realize the value of cheap labor meanwhile some contractor will get the contract to build the wall which he will do from the mexican side no doubt as otherwise his margin will not make it worthwhile so also the wonderful idea to outlaw the h visa i dont think it will take very long for trump and his gang to realize that there is a reason there are blond jokes and that indians are not blond go figure that 
the good news is that trump made public what was private  racism misogyny in a country that never stops trumpeting about womens equality support for genocide wars and weapons sales the evils of unbridled capitalism lockerroom conversations which indicate attitudes  have all come out of the closet and lockerroom now it is up to those who like to say that they believe in the opposite of all these things to get off their backsides and bring about change they can no longer live the lives of pretense and lies that they had become used to saying it is not happening here trump proved that it is happening and has trumpeted it from the top of trump tower sorry for so much bad punning in one breath but there you go 
as for muslims and trump believe me trump is far better than what muslims have seen in the past he is far better than what we have today take sisi the oily royals who are personal friends of every weapons dealer the paki leadership and i can think of several more and trump begins to look like a choir boy what will he do that is not already happening frankly i dont know and dont care to speculate because the prime movers behind muslim affairs and how they are are muslims themselves our leadership or more correctly its spectacular failure ordinary citizens pay the price but whats new about that the fact remains that until we sort that out and do something about taking charge of our destiny we must remain satisfied with others writing the script we are compelled to live by play endings depend on the script not on the players 
india is a classic example where a socalled minority of  million is kicked around like a football and used at will by every mercenary politician for his own ends but indian muslims seem to be satisfied with that so who is anyone else to complain if you disagree and tell me that they are not satisfied then i must ask you what it is that prevents them from doing what is glaringly obvious get their act together change their leaders and write their own script  million is not a minority it is a nation but only if it chooses to be same story for muslims globally no point in blaming trump or looking up to him to find solutions it is our problem and we must solve it so let us start doing that 
two other points what about wars global warming and such issues well when you have a nation that lives on perpetual warfare and is supported in that by all the other major industrial nations who either manufacture and sell weapons or buy them how can you pin it all on trump if weapons are made and sold there will be wars wars will happen if they continue to make profits for those who run them that people die is incidental those at the top who laugh all the way to the bank dont those that do dont count they are collateral who are necessary to prove the efficacy of the weapons that were used to vaporize them if it wasnt for the bugs who splatted how would you assess the drones or their operators the fact that the bugs were innocent or that they had families and so on well bugs are bugs and thats all that there is to it 
global warming america decided on that when it chose bush instead of al gore for a minute i thought that was because they got confused because his name is al gore like al ghurair but then i realized that it was because he had a terminal problem he had a brain see his famous movie an inconvenient truth and you will see what i mean httpswwwalgorecomlibraryaninconvenienttruthdvd if you do nothing else buy this and see it at least you will know why you died since you chose that especially americans i believe it is only fair that you understand what you did with trump that came out in the open so get used to summer all year long you wont need to go to the french riviera for a tan you can get it at home that is not inconvenient 
add to this the effect ofunending wars refugee movement changing cultures security nightmares coming true widening gap between the rich and the poor global poverty and hunger preventable disease which is not prevented because theres no profit in it  when i think about all this and trumps election nero comes to mind renewing our link with tradition let us dance to the tune whats the use of fiddling otherwise 
final question that everyone is asking how safe is it to have someone like trump with his finger on the nuclear button 
my answer is the one who actually pressed that button was as different from trump as could be yet he did it let me leave you to figure out the rest 
meanwhile it is midnight where i live far away from trump and america and time to go to bed truly it is said that there is solace in sleep so good night world sleep well as long as you stay asleep you can escape responsibility

Infowars Nightly News,after vets fight war feds demand money back,"bill clintons son danney williams has youtube channel restored youtube had deactivated channel hosting popular documentary linking williams to bill clinton infowarscom  october   comments 
youtube has decided to reverse its ban on a channel registered by a man who claims to be bill clintons longlost son 
your youtube account was suspended due to repeated or severe violations of our terms and our community guidelines and as such cannot be restored the company wrote earlier this week to danney williams after he filed an appeal to restore his channel 
for decades williams has been on a mission to reunite with the person he believes to be his biological father the nd president of the united states william jefferson clinton 
the most popular video on the channel  a nineminute minidocumentary posted two weeks ago produced by filmmaker joel gilbert features the yearold williams recounting memories from his childhood which prompted the search for his father 
arguing the channel had absolutely zero violations of any kind gilbert places blame for the suspension squarely at google and the clinton campaigns feet 
its obvious to me that the fix is in gilbert wrote in a statement the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danny to run him off the plantation as danny said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in  
youtube later restored williams channel early thursday morning claiming a review confirmed it was not in violation of its terms of service 
last week danney went to las vegas  the site of the third us presidential debate  where he held a press conference alongside his lawyers announcing his intention to seek a dna sample from bill clinton in order to settle the paternity dispute 
danney and his lawyers claim a previous dna test carried out by the tabloid star magazine failed to obtain a blood sample from clinton an assertion confirmed by one of stars former editors to world net daily  
i dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on clintons dna former star magazine editor phil bunton stated to wnd

the th woman has come forward to accuse donald trump of doing what he bragged about doing on the billy bush bus tape 
in a story that sounds very familiar former miss finland ninni laaksonen told the tabloid iltasanomat that the now republican nominee grabbed her butt just before trump and three other beauty pageant contests went on the air for the late show with david letterman in  
before the show we were photographed outside the building laaksonen is quoted by haaretz  trump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt he really grabbed my butt i dont think anybody saw it but i flinched and thought what is happening 
as to the veracity of these claims it should be noted that laaksonen didnt seek the tabloid out iltasanomat the second largest paper in the country according to wikipedia  reached out to finnish women who had encountered trump and thats how they discovered her story 
in case youre not already grimacing the former miss finland added somebody told me there that trump liked me because i looked like melania when she was younger 
trump has been caught on tape saying women expire at the age of  melania trump is now  so she would have been expired when this alleged groping incident took place in  
new york magazine has an exhaustive list of allegations made by women against donald trump 
donald trump is on tape bragging about grabbing women by their pssy against their will so its not a stretch to hear that he did indeed do this to women who are also willing to come forward and face the wrath of the trump machine 
what should be alarming is that donald trump is the best of the best on the republican bench i mean that is supposed to be how this works right a group of top contenders are picked for possible nomination and the best gets it

No Author,iranian products on display in kiev,"iran raps rare eu clauses in trade deals fri oct   pm economy asghar fakhrieh kashan irans deputy minister of roads and urban development has criticized very exceptional terms and conditions that europeans are including in trade deals with iran 
a top official in tehran has accused european government of failing to take the required measures to facilitate trade agreements with iran  what he says is already in violation of a nuclear agreement that was sealed with the country last summer and came into effect in january 
asghar fakhrieh kashan irans deputy minister of roads and urban development told the financial times that european government should prevent the inclusion of what he described as very exceptional terms and conditions in trade agreements with iran 
fakhrieh kashan warned that such terms and conditions were effectively discouraging investments in the iranian economy 
he said export credit agencies were specifically demanding premiums on insurance that made banks insist on putting what he described as unacceptable terms in contracts related to political risk in doing business with iran 
fakhrieh kashan emphasized that iran will not accept any clauses in trade agreements which he said foresee such possibilities like snapback sanctions and new sanctions against iran 
european businesses he said are in fact trying to devise deals in which political risks are inserted alongside commercial risks  what he said is totally rejected by the islamic republic 
if anyone needed guarantees against political risks it was iran fakhrieh kashan said in reference to the impact of western sanctions on the iranian economy 
why should iran accept very exceptional terms and conditions in its contracts with european companies this is not called a normal relationship he said

Alex Ansary,feds warn nyc officials about possible al qaeda attack,"the man behind the trump rally disturbance in reno  
usa today 
the man who caused a commotion at a donald trump rally saturday said hes a registered republican who wanted only to show his displeasure with his partys nominee 
members of the audience at the event for the gop presidential nominee tackled austyn crites  of reno after someone yelled gun while others were trying to rip away his antitrump sign 
i just went with sign that said republicans against trump  crites said its a sign that you can find online i held up the sign and initially people around me were just booing me telling me to get out of there then a couple of these guys tried grabbing the sign out of my hands 
crites had no weapon secret service agents later released a statement to that effect and let him go without charges 
agents whisked trump offstage because crites was near the front of the auditorium at the renosparks convention center 
crites said he holds no ill will toward the secret service or reno police who were just doing their job 
i was trying to get the secret services attention for them to respond said michael newton  of santa rosa calif who helped restrain crites they didnt respond i thought i had to do something i put my knee on what i think was his head so im not really sure there were five guys on him and he was moving i tried to help them immobilize him in final colorado push trump urges supporters to handdeliver ballots 
newton said he felt as if crites were the aggressor 
i saw his hand contact someones face he said maybe two people 
crites said he didnt strike anyone but after he was taken to the ground he felt as if he were being mobbed 
multiple people just tackled me down kicking me choking me and just beating me up he said thats when things even got crazier i was on the ground and people were holding my arms legs and i kept saying i can barely breathe i was turning my neck just to get a little bit of air to keep from passing out 
thats when police intervened taking crites away in handcuffs 
newtons partner donald newton  of santa rosa took video of the immediate aftermath 
the secret service said its investigation is ongoing the agency uses magnetometers at presidential campaign sites making it difficult for weapons to be smuggled into events 
whats baffling to crites is how anyone could have thought he had a gun his sign was in the air for some time and he wasnt making any sudden movements he said 
it wasnt like they noticed something suspicious and tackled me crites said thats not the case 
he said he backs some gop candidates and just wanted to voice frustration with trump not cause panic 
i love all the people in that rally he said were all fellow americans theyre doing their patriotic duty they support their candidate im just there showing that im a republican im all of your peoples brother i just have a slight difference of opinion 
later on facebook crites wrote that he has no connection with the campaign of democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton but has canvassed for her for about three hours contributed to her campaign and voted for her 
take what happened to me tonight as a classic example of dictator incitement of violence  against your own republican brother with a stupid sign he wrote the post and his entire account were taken down soon afterward as some trump supporters on social media called him a clinton thughillary shill and trump assassin 
shortly after the incident at the rally trump returned to the stage to raucous applause thanking the secret service and launching back into his prepared remarks his campaign later issued a statement also thanking the secret service and his supporters

wikileaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what hillary clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration but clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations 
she has focused instead on criticizing the russians as the source of the hacks despite the fact there is no proof of russian involvement 
the emails also shed light on how the clinton campaign interacts with wall street banks with friendly media and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of democratic rival bernie sanders with the help of the dnc 
wikileaks says it has about  emails from the private gmail account of john podesta a senior democratic party official who has served as white house chief of staff under president bill clinton and a senior adviser to president obama he was the author of obamas climate change policy john podesta 
in february podesta moved seamlessly from the white house to become chairman of hillary clintons  presidential campaign 
here are some of the most explosive revelations from the wikileaks email dumps featuring podestas account and others 
preference for muslim americans in  when podesta served as cochair of presidentelect barack obamas transition team michael froman a former citibank executive sent podesta a list of african american latino and asian american candidates broken down by cabinetdeputy and underassistantdeputy assistant level plus a list of native american arabmuslim american and disabled american candidates the arab american list came with a special note to exclude arab christians  they had to be both arab and muslimas new republic reports obamas eventual cabinet appointments ended up almost entirely as froman recommendedfroman ultimately became the recipient of the largest bailout from the federal government during the financial crisis 
shielding obama in a march   email to hillary clintons lawyer cheryl mills clintons eventual campaign chairman podesta asks if they should withhold email exchanges between clinton and president obama that were sent over clintons private serverthe day before podesta sent his email to mills the house benghazi committee privately told clinton to preserve and hand over all her emailsthe email from podesta to mills says think we should hold emails to and from potus thats the heart of his exec privilege we could get them to ask for that they may not care but it seems like they will an email exchange between podesta paul begala and clinton pollster gqrr shows the clinton campaign was pushing the muslim obama narrative back in january  included was a survey of obama negative facts such as this one obama owebahmuhs father was a muslim and obama grew up among muslims in the worlds most populous islamic country the pollster writes we have reworked the obama message into the survey as requested 
secret speeches to wall street hillary clinton was so enraged that bill clinton was forced to cancel a paid speech at wall street bank morgan stanley in  that she needed a cool down period the email chain on march   before she formally launched her campaign includes top aides to both hillary clinton and former president clinton and reveals that hillarys future campaign aides were concerned about the political impact of bill giving a speech to a wall street bank morgan stanley is coming down wrote robby mook in an email to top clinton aidestop aide huma abedin explained that hillary would not be happy about it writing hrc very strongly did not want him to cancel that particular speech i will have to tell her that bill chose to cancel it not that we asked hillary clintons paid speeches to goldman sachs and other financial firms a point of contention during this years primary were the subject of an email to podesta excerpts from some of the speeches had been flagged by clintons research team including the necessity of having both a public and a private position on issues it was just part of making sausage in the political arena she said that certain positions on issues needed to be kept hidden from the public some flags in hillary clintons paid speeches were noted in a jan  email from campaign research director tony carrk to top clinton advisers including clintons declaration that my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere countless establishment media outlets parlaying themselves as fact checkers tried to downplay this email by saying it was mostly about trade not immigration as if the words open borders were never mentioned but the email exchange also shows how hillarys aboutface on the tpp trade deal was mere pandering to bernie sanders voters and had no basis in reality in terms of how she really feels about trade deals in a speech at goldmanblack rock on feb   carrk pointed out clinton admitted shes kind of far removed from middleclass struggles due to the economic you know fortunes that my husband and i now enjoy clinton in other speeches boasted of her ties to wall street an issue primary opponent bernie sanders continually raised clinton still has refused to release transcripts of her paid speeches while blasting donald trump for not releasing his tax returns 
working in tandem with friendly media wnd reported tuesday emails showing reporters editors and contributors not just advocating for hillary clinton but apparently colluding with the campaign univision chairman haim saban urged the clinton campaign to hit donald trump harder over immigration the boston globe tried to time a clinton opinion piece to do the most good in new hampshire cnbcs john harwood urged clinton campaign chairman podesta to watch out for thengop candidate dr ben carson democratic national committee official and cnn contributor donna brazile apparently tipped off the clinton campaign to a potentially difficult cnn townhall question on capital punishment during the democratic party primary season brazile adamantly denies it  in a july  email new york times reporter mark leibovich appeared to ask permission from hillary clintons communications director jennifer palmieri to use certain quotes of the presidential candidate in an article palmieri replied suggesting he remove a reference clinton made to sarah palin and delete clintons statement and gay rights has moved much faster than womens rights or civil rights which is an interesting phenomenon cnbc correspondent john harwood who was widely criticized for posing biased questions to donald trump as a primary debate moderator effectively served as an adviser to the clinton campaign emailing podesta with the subject line watch out the warning was regarding gop presidential candidate ben carson who could give you real trouble in a general election maggie haberman a former politico reporter who now works for the new york times was described in a january  memo as having a very good relationship with the clinton campaign we have had her tee up stories for us before and have never been disappointed the memo said 
demeaning catholics podesta discussed fomenting revolution in the catholic church with a progressive activist while hillarys nowcommunications director jennifer palmieri mocked catholics who speak out against the liberal social causes of the democratic party there needs to be a catholic spring in which catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the catholic church sandy newman president and founder of the nonprofit voices for progress wrote podesta in february   the email among the third batch released by wikileaks was titled opening for a catholic spring just musing podesta tells newman of progressive organizations he and his colleagues created to recruit members of the church who can lead a revolution when the time is rightwe created catholics in alliance for the common good to organize for a moment like this the clinton campaign chairman writes but i think it lacks the leadership to do so now likewise catholics united like most spring movements i think this one will have to be bottom up clinton who has accused trump of praising putin called the russian leader in a  speech engaging and a very interesting conversationalist excerpts from clintons speeches were contained in a document emailed to podesta to point out quotes that could harm the campaign 
collusion with doj clinton spokesman brian fallon alerted staffers that the justice department was proposing to publish clintons workrelated emails contending it showed collusion between the obama administration and clintons campaign fallon wrote that doj folks told him a court hearing in the case had been planned the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october podesta met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik a top official at the justice department lawyers also told the clinton campaign in emails that hillarys private email scandal  smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing ive either gotten discovery sanctions for fired people for etc  
entanglements with foreign governments king muhammad iv of morocco made a  million pledge to fund the clinton global initiative conference but only if the likely presidential candidate attended the event as a speaker hillarys top aide huma abedin wrote in a january  email that if hrc was not part of it meeting was a nonstarter then she warned she created this mess and she knows it hillary ended up not attending but her husband bill did an email from hillary clintons account to podesta on aug   said saudi arabia and qatar were providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isis and other radical sunni groups in the region critics have pointed out that the clinton foundation has received considerable funding from the two middle east nations in a leaked  paid speech to the jewish united fund of metropolitan chicago hillary said jordan and turkey cant possibly vet all those refugees so they dont know if you know jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees two years later she called for a  percent increase in the number of syrian refugees coming to the us largely from united nations refugee camps in jordan

one thing i have yet to see anyone bring up is how this election could be bait and switch at the last minute in order to understand this however i need to explain the unique possibilities the nwo has created with these two candidates and how this is in fact a very old card from the s 
first we have trump everyone loves trump because trump is not hillary therefore he must be better it is an argument based on the following stalin killed  million and one while mao killed  million and two so stalin is better than mao trump is outright the lets go back to sleep candidate hillary is not already i have seen and heard more than enough about how if only trump goes in then at least four more years have been bought and the nation will survive juts four more years 
from the so called militia and patriots at awrm and the intelligence report they yammer that if only trump goes in then we can postpone the coming war or buy ourselves more time to prepare after all they claim time favors us not the enemy all this bearing in mind that trump has gone back on his word many times changed his mind flip flopped on illegals wants a bigger police state is the most hated in the media etc now lets compare the next runner up quickly 
hillary it is currently chic to hate hillary youre not in style if you like her she will end the nation doom the world and so on never mind that both trump and hillary were put up by the nwo you are not allowed to run otherwise this is old news she is going to cause more war she is a liar cheat she betrayed the nation etc yet both her and trump met with netanyahu behind closed doors and apparently received his blessing to proceed it is a trap and we should all know it and see it clearly she is also the darling of the media 
both of them have in common the s rise to power theme of lenin and hitler both take after these two for both nations germany and russia were in collapse or outright collapsed debauchery was the rule as well as corruption hillary is like lenin she is going in red banners flying and the cheka on her heels to remove any undesirables she is going to finish the job and push the agenda to the hilt even if it takes war to do it trump on the other hand is following hitlers script offering hope without promising anything except a bigger government more powerful police state etc trump will also see the plan to fruition but there is a subtle nuance between these two one is offering to do it with an iron fist in a velvet glove the other is simply the iron fist 
now comes the problem people are not seeing if they force hillary in despite all the public outrage then we know for a fact they have reached a level of preparation that is adequate to dealing with public backlash even insurrection should it be minor or full if they put trump in then they are taking the back street approach because they have not gathered the resources yet to put us down and need to put someone in who will quiet the public just like obama did for a time this election is about purchasing time nothing more nothing less 
if trump is put in then already we can see that most are going straight back to bed and not getting up for another four years at minimum maybe eight the militias and other patriot groups will declare a partial victory and that they can bury their guns again and whistle dixie they are mortified of having to take action so trump is their obvious choice hillary on the other hand represents that steamroller coming down the hill at full tilt they do not want that and seek to avoid it rather than fight it the reality is time does not favor us here time favors the enemy if time favored us then we would not be here diminished and in dire straits imagine how much could have been avoided had the militia stood up during waco again time favored the enemy ruby ridge time favored the enemy as they whittle away and build their power base up bit by bit they are not fools 
consider those two possibilities then consider this if trump goes in and goes along with the war with russia if indeed that is the plan for ww they laid out more than sixity years ago admittedly people are far more willing to join trumps army and go fight than they would hillary something else to consider is perhaps they want a second civil war put hillary in knowing it will cause an insurrection fake one which we know they can do have trump reluctantly take the reins and like davis lead the way in marching the fools single file into the enemy guns just like the first one causing mass casualties for nothing a second civil war of this sort would favor the enemy for it would absolutely end the nation but who would fight for hillary oh right thats why they are bringing in all those foreigners and foreign troops just change the uniform quickly and voila some would suggest this would favor the american nationals not really rather than fight intelligently for the bill of rights they would be fighting for trump they would be fighting to bleed us dry like the confederates did in the civil war fighting by the rules and it cost them dearly only by fighting by our own rules can we win trump would allow them to guide the slaughter one way or another all the while weakening us remember the end game is to destroy absolutely the last vestiges of americans and our culture whatever may be left of it which is not much if anything 
perhaps the above is where those warning about the coming breakup of america will occur perhaps perhaps not but they now have the option to do so i want you to think on all this and let your mind run wild with other possibilities but just remember that they are right now lining the ducks up you while the firing squad is forming up and loading their rifles no matter what you believe will be the outcome of this and no matter what happens one way or another know that this is all preplanned and they would never allow this situation unless they had a humdinger of a plan hidden just beneath the surface i hope i scratched that surface for you like you they have a plan a b c and d it is why they have succeeded for more than two centuries do not take them for the fool they have proven they are not 
so maybe we will get trump and the populace will quiet down while the communists march on with a different uniform cheka versus gestapo then again hillary might go in and just finish things and be done with it or prep the nation for the next phase no matter what happens be ready for it and do not let them sucker you into believing this honest or that trump is honest they are both in on it together they merely represent two different paths for them to reach their ultimate goal share this",der-postillon.com,Fake,german,18.593054831360817,13.781206693316946,58,8,6694,1273,4.247446975648075,1273.0,-0.1210531164556349,-0.3899286096724409,0.982937316647674,1.2177027943242738,-0.8306507941545404,1.2577696271077237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0471962739708081,0.0,0.1674,0.0635999999999999,0.0611999999999999,0.8752,Positive,Weak
No Author,why so few whistleblowers a former cia agents story,"is there any merit in taking a cynical view of life are the observations of cynicism realistic brave observations on human nature freed from sentimentality or are they only the somber commentary offered by one who is a loser at the game of life taking solace in his weakness and failure there are compelling arguments either way what is not disputed however is that françois de la rouchefoucauld was one of the most brilliantly cynical epigrammers who ever lived
it probably did not help that he came from a long line of noblemen for nothing so enfeebles the soul as much as inherited wealth and titles he was born in  and inherited the title of duke on the death of his father in  receiving the usual education of his class he dabbled in military matters in his teens various itinerant love affairs followed with wellplaced women but some of these ended badly we find him imprisoned in bastille for a week in  for political intrigue

although married he continued to pursue other women as was the custom of the time and his station marriages in those days were business affairs to be ignored at each partys pleasure or necessity one such dalliance resulted in an illegitimate child but the woman eventually rejected him for a more appealing competitor in  he found himself mixed up with a quasirevolt called the fronde an adventure that left him with impaired sight when he was struck with a musket ball in the head health problems also intervened to add to his misery in the form of gout and melancholy
in late seventeenth century france the paris salons were centers of debate discussion and the flowering of controversial ideas by now la rochefoucauld had acquired an acrid talent for stinging prose and he knew how to use it his failures in love and war had primed his spirit for a cynical view of life and this predilection meshed well with the taste of the salons for savage wit nothing is so shallow as sophistication
from his frequent visits to the salon of mme de sable in paris he had begun to piece together a body of epigrams that represented his worldview one of his peers had more commercial goals in mind for a bootleg collection of  of his sayings was first published without his permission and with no attribution in  two years later he finally put out a proper edition this contained  maxims the volume was titled sentences et maximes morales  but this is usually shortened to maxims 
there is a philosophy here it centers around the idea that all men are selfseeking egoists to a fault any virtue a man displays is only a smokescreen concealing his selflove our virtues are only vices in disguise human vanity takes precedence over nearly all else virtues are lost in selfinterest as rivers are in the sea even the nobler emotions like love and altruism according to la rochefoucauld are only a kind of traffic in which selflove ever proposes to be the gainer he took a dim view of women finding them fit only for love for men such as himself of course and procreation one of his crueler maxims was few womens worth lasts longer than their beauty

but lifes realities eventually caught up with him softening his rougher edges his wife who had cared for him in his infirmities for eighteen years died in  his mothers death followed two years later two of his sons would eventually die of injuries received in frances ruinous wars of the period
this gloomy picture was brightened by the entry into his life of the mme de la fayette who was twenty years his junior she invited him to stay with her in paris and he was carried there with difficulty she seems to have viewed him as a reform project she would later say that he gave me understanding but i reformed his heart perhaps his fame made him an interesting captive the union worked and seemed to alleviate his dark picture of humanity and when his final hours came he asked for and received the last rites of the church in 
a fair assessment of la rochefoucauld must take into account his undeniable wit his probing sensitivity and his ability to strip away the pretenses behind many human actions yet all in all his maxims are meager in result many of them are superficial and shallow the product of a personality still nursing the wounds of an early disillusionment we weary of his aphorisms after two or three pages and hesitate to reopen his book later
worse still he was wrong to say that virtue and altruism are shams nothing is more vital to life and we can see them around us every day if only we know where to look and as long as our senses are not blinded by fear timor animi auribus officit  as sallust says fear blocks out the ears

any bitter weakling can be a cynic but it takes depth of character to accept the worldsand mansfaults and foibles and to balance those against mans unquestioned capacity for greatness of soul broader life experiences might have corrected la rochefoucaulds errors but he preferred to remain in a state of arrested development while receiving the applause and notoriety of paris society his maxims can bring smiles to our faces as it is easy to find amusement in the flaws of others yet we forget that his barbs were directed at us as well
montaigne was far wiser for he took a balanced view of life accepting the worlds absurdities and joys with the equanimity and calm resolution of a greek or roman sage he was also a better man la rochefoucauld was intelligent without being wise and never found the confidence in himself to submit his ego to the consolatory power of a higher philosophical authority in any form cynicism in the end strips a man of his most important protective armor and leaves him naked to face the cruelties of life no cynic ever died a happy man

starring burgess jenkins of remember the titans and nashville and gregory alan williams of miracles from heaven this awardwinning movie brings the love of baseball to hearth and home it also features a powerful music soundtrack by threetime grammy winner michael omartian 
get every boy needs a hero now at the wnd superstore from the producers of alone yet not alone the movie is a powerful tale of restoring and strengthening relationships between fathers and their children 
according to dr ted baehr founder of movieguide  hero is an excellent movie about god turning a mans heart to his son and a son learning to forgive his father 
dr baehr added the opening is powerful the ending is heartrending the drama the acting the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie this is one of the few movies that movieguide can actually say go see it keith harris and nick edwards as wynn and sammy heller 
hero opens with joe played by burgess jenkins coaching his son davids baseball team the gappers to the state championship seven years later after pursuing his dream job joe returns to town he had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family his wife hannah is stricken with cancer while david is angry that joe left them after hannahs funeral joe moves back into the house but david remains bitter meanwhile david is coaching the now hapless gappers the team loses more than it wins joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners hoping this gesture will help joe reconcile with david unfortunately the league rules have softened dramatically making it nearly impossible to train the team properly practice times are limited coaches cant make players take laps around the field everyone gets a participation trophy the beloved american pastime has become so boring that few parents show up for games let alone practices so joe starts his own league to turns things around 
from the director of isaiah  judgment and the producer of alone not yet alone comes hero a beautiful tale of the significance of the fatherchild relationship thats and set around americas pastime baseball 
one of the fathers joe pursues for the new league is the warden of the local prison mr redding played by gregory alan williams reddings career mirrors that of joe hes been offered a big job in washington dc like joe hes lured by fame and fortune at the expense of his relationship with his son and family in contrast another gapper teammate has a father whos actually a prison inmate under redding unlike many of the absent fathers outside the prison walls the inmate father has a great desire to practice baseball with his son but he cannot due to prison rules justin miles and burgess jenkins as david and joe finn in the film every boy needs a hero 
what makes hero particularly compelling today is that it addresses the growing crisis of absentee fathers and its impact on baseball itself 
watch the trailer 
washington times reporter bradford richardson wrote in his article study blames absent fathers for decline in black baseball players that the austin institute a texasbased think tank focused on family and societal issues has commissioned a study titled called out at home which shows a correlation between the decline of black fatherhood and the drop in black participation in baseball 
from the director of isaiah  judgment and the producer of alone not yet alone comes hero a beautiful tale of the significance of the fatherchild relationship thats and set around americas pastime baseball 
richardson writes 
kevin stuart executive director of the austin institute said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because it takes two to play catch 
there is a longstanding connection between fatherhood and baseball mr stuart said pointing to famous fatherson tandems who have played in the major leagues and the prominence of fatherson relationships in popular baseball movies such as field of dreams 
baseball he said was made to be played by fathers and sons 
baseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle where whats really necessary or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you mr stuart said 
anecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the studys connection between fatherhood and baseball 
famous fatherson tandems  including ken griffey sr and ken griffey jr prince fielder and cecil fielder and tony gwynn sr and tony gwynn jr  have talked about how the game was handed down from one generation to the next 
hero received a powerful endorsement from renowned christian author stormie omartian 
for such a time as this hero is an important movie about the estranged relationship between a father and his son who learn how to reconcile using faith and baseball farah said 
baehr concluded hero is a wonderful faithfilled sports drama it will touch your heart your mind and your soul gapper team dads from the film every boy needs a hero",wnd.com,Real,english,97.12303591710229,90.07139083078093,31,6,5415,919,4.861806311207834,919.0,-0.946579178718867,-0.7657300402589515,0.6445501513337534,0.6627437946416888,-0.224338380577588,0.6898359037078503,0.0021762785636561,0.0,0.001088139281828,0,1,0.0,0.0046221209839099,0.9988,0.183,0.076,0.741,Positive,Very Strong
Beau Albrecht,the sad saga of john walker lindh rebel without a clue,"in an excerpt of a john pilger special interview julian assange says that emails released by wikileaks show that hillary clinton is intentionally misguiding voters about the degree to which us allies are supporting isis and that donald trump will not be allowed into the oval office
assange explains that the same financial interests funding isis are funding clinton he references a  email from john podesta to clinton in which we find the following
while this militaryparamilitary operation is moving forward we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of qatar and saudi arabia which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil and other radical sunni groups in the region

i think this is the most significant email in the whole collection said assange all serious analysts know and even the us government has agreed that some saudi figures have been supporting isis and funding isis but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves but that email says that it is the government of saudi arabia and the government of qatar that have been funding isis
pilger asked assange about the possibility that trump would steal the election with the help of russia as many in the democratic party claim
assange thinks that this is highly unlikely but not because he is unpopular my analysis is that trump would not be permitted to win why do i say that because he has had every establishment off his side trump does not have one establishment maybe with the exception of the evangelicals if you can call them establishment he explained
assange says that hillary is the establishment pick banks intelligence arms companies foreign money etc are all united behind hillary clinton and the media as well media owners and the journalists themselves delivered by the daily sheeple

Roosh Valizadeh,the wisdom books of the old testament," things america can learn from hungarys resistance against the migrant masses  things america can learn from hungarys resistance against the migrant masses 
the paprika plutocrat is a spicy capitalistic hungarian blogger follow his unyielding assaults against cultural marxism on his blog paprikaplutocratcom november   politics 
on the  nd of october hungary has seen a stunning manifestation of national unity as  of votes cast on a referendum regarding the euimposed migrant settlement quotas were declared a strong and undebatable no now the hungarian national parliament works at incorporating the referendum results as an amendment to the countrys constitution while some leftwing news outletslike the guardiancelebrated the supposed inadequacy of the referendum it is beyond dispute that the message of the voting is strong and firm 
here are five lessons we can learn from this monumental stand against globalism  democracies need strong leaders 
wimpy western politicians would have their voters believe that personality does not matter strong witty and masculine politicians are often depicted as exponents of a fascistic personality cult nowadays it seems not much distinction is made between being a macho and being a nazi 
in reality all great western democratic leaders were strong menand sometimes women winston churchill charles de gaulle david bengurion ronald reagan and margaret thatcher were not known for being timid politically correct politicians who would retract and apologize for every past comment that theyve made do you think that todays eu politicians and western leaders could have beaten hitler or won the cold war 
hungarys viktor orbán might have some faults but he is certainly not a shy and weak politician who lacks magnetism even his opponents will grant him that he has a rare political talent and an almost visionary skill for seeing future happenings think of how one year ago hungary was the first european country to build a wall to keep the migrant wave out today most countriesfrom austria to great britainfollow his lead 
just listen to his  th march  speech made on hungarys national holiday commemorating the countrys  freedom fight against the habsburgs look at how he is standing in the rain without some guy holding an umbrella over his head this man has speaking skills grand views and balls 
the idea that western democracies can function with leaders who have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a lowgrade bank clerkto quote nigel farage who has so sharply put it to herman van rompuyis a lie and has no foundation in reality democracy is about the masses the masses need inspiration and leaders democratic leaders therefore have to be strong and need game themselves 
i am personally a friend of monarchies and i have libertarian arguments for it but as long as the western world believes in democracy we cannot have cucks and wimps protecting it  liberty is protected by the rightwing 
anyone who believes in game enjoys the fruits if western liberal capitalism like it or not yes the modern world has its faults but freedom of speech freedom of sex life freedom of entrepreneurship and freedom of travel are all essential parts of our lifestyle of course these are tenets that the left hates today in fact if you want to live free and live a masculine lifestyle the liberalism of today is certainly not your friend 
therefore im going to write about liberty and not liberalism one can debate the difference between these terms in short what i mean is that the left today doesnt want you to be free but wants a politically correct nanny state to control and plan every move you make and punish you if you do not oblige 
the right however still stands for the basic concept of personal liberty that we have grown to love and respect hungary has been criticized a lot by leftwing groups for having curbed some freedoms i will agree that some of these state actions were unnecessary and hardly defensible but hungaryand easterneuropetoday still has more freedom than some corners of the ohsoliberalandtolerant western world 
in hungary universities rarely propagate the debased agenda of social justice wars cultural marxism is regularly attacked and barely tolerated feminism is rare and marginal and the country is overwhelmingly conservative and right wing the governing party with twothirds of parliamentary seats is centreright the largest opposition party is openly farright in the capital city of budapest one of the best and cheapest cities for nightlife and gaming in europe you will certainly not be prosecuted for stopping hot girls and asking for their numberunlike some western cities  minorities are misled 
the hungarian pressmuch outside of the view of the grand world due to our rarely known and complicated languagehas been in throes for the past few months about the migrant crisis like most eastern european countries hungary barely has any immigration or muslims in fact if theres a black person on the street people will often turn their heads 
debates that have been present in the western mediaabout muslim integration terror and islam palestine and israel have only recently surfaced in the hungarian press minorities of course have been misled by the leftwing press into believing that the migrants were refugees poor victims whom he have a responsibility to assist the jewish press meaning official jewish congregation organs not conspiracy theories and lgbt groups voiced their concern for tolerance and nonviolent communication 
it is probably not a grand revelation to most readers of this site that muslim immigration brings little good to minorities as milo yiannopoulos said in a lecture of his the muslims are not on top of the oppression ladder but they want to kill all the others on the oppression ladder minorities have been misled into following the agenda of the political left the sight of hungarys gay public personalities demonstrating for letting in muslims in front the parliament is a clear proof of this  feminists love islam 
feminism in hungary is a rare bird but it does exist one such radical marxistfeminist made the news when she openly argued that there could be no terrorists among muslim refugees this of course was before the paris and brussels attacks many of the perpetrators of which arrived as refugees through hungary a few days ago i stumbled across the facebook page of another fine specimen this hardly attractive girl celebrated the empowerment of the hijab which according to her was a beautiful expression of females voluntary decision to defy the dating market 
describing such violent and shameful oppression of people as voluntary selfempowerment is crazy feminists live in denial of facts and the recent alliance between crazy radical islam and marxist feminism only proves that neither has any love for western culture  eastern europe is still ok 
the western media gleefully celebrated the fact that with a voter turnout of a little more than  the  limit of required turnout was not reached according to hungarian laws however a referendum with  or more electorate turnout is valid even if not politically binding the hungarian government will soon amend the constitution to declare that brussels cannot force the country to take in immigrants without the consent of the people 
such a policy is clear and sound the message is that eastern europewith all its faults economic lagging and sometimes real intoleranceis still a better place to live for masculine men that many a place in the western world here masculine lifestyle is appreciated donald trump has grand supporteven viktor orbán voiced his good wishes for the republican presidentelectand feminism has failed to win any serious ground

las vegas hill also said hell seek his clients release from federal custody pending trial in nevada ammon bundy and his followers took over the oregon bird sanctuary on jan  they objected to prison sentences handed down to dwight and steven hammond two local ranchers convicted of setting fires they demanded the government free the father and son and relinquish control of public lands to local officials the bundys and other key figures were arrested in a jan  traffic stop outside the refuge that ended with police fatally shooting robert lavoy finicum an occupation spokesman most occupiers left after his death but four holdouts remained until feb  when they surrendered following a lengthy negotiation federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case finishing with a display of more than  guns seized after the standoff an fbi agent testified that  live rounds and nearly  spent casings were found during trial bundy testified that the plan was to take ownership of the refuge by occupying it for a period of time and then turn it over to local officials to use as they saw fit bundy also testified that the occupiers carried guns because they would have been arrested immediately otherwise and to protect themselves against possible government attack the bird sanctuary takeover drew sympathizers from around the west it also drew a few protesters who were upset that the armed occupation was preventing others from using the land they included kieran suckling executive director of the center for biological diversity suckling on thursday called the acquittals extremely disturbing for anyone who cares about americas public lands the rights of native people and their heritage and a political system that refuses to be bullied by violence and racism the bundy clan and their followers peddle a dangerous brand of radicalism aimed at taking over lands owned by all of us i worry this verdict only emboldens the kind of intimidation and rightwing violence that underpins their movement suckling said one of ammon bundys attorneys morgan philpot had a different perspective after watching mumford get tackled by marshals his liberty was just assaulted by the very government that was supposed to protect it by the very government that just prosecuted his client  unjustly as the jury found theres another oregon trial coming up over the wildlife refuge

Jason Easley,trump is deadbeating on his campaign debts by refusing to pay his own pollster,"military british defense secretary michael fallon photo by afp 
british defense minister michael fallon says the uk is set to deploy hundreds of troops to the baltic region in europe to support its nato allies in the face of a more assertive russia 
fallon told a nato ministerial meeting in brussels on wednesday that britain would send  soldiers to estonia to fulfill its pledge to deliver one of four battalions to natos enhanced forward presence in eastern europe 
backed by a rising defense budget this deployment of air land and sea forces shows that we will continue to play a leading role in nato supporting the defense and security of our allies from the north to the south of the alliance fallon said 
nato had announced in july that it would deploy on a rotational basis four multinational battalions to poland and the baltic statesestonia latvia and lithuaniato deter what it referred to as any russian incursion 
during his address at the meeting fallon also said that four british typhoon fighter jets would be dispatched to romania under the nato southern air policing mission which is supposed to protect the baltic states airspace against possible attacks from russia 
this is about two things reassurance and that needs to be done with some formidable presence and deterrence fallon had said in an earlier interview this is not simply a tripwirethis is a serious military presence 
the move is likely to draw criticism from moscow which has been angered by natos military buildup on its western borders 
the usled military alliance cut its ties with moscow in  and has been reinforcing its presence near russias borders ever since 
the uk and russia have strong disagreements over a number of issues mainly the conflicts in syria and ukraine 
the two countries military forces have been involved in a series of aerial and naval confrontations with britain sending its jets and warships on several occasions to intercept russian bombers and naval fleets 
the latest of those encounters occurred on thursday when the russian aircraft career admiral kuznetsov and its sevenship task force were shadowed by two british warships on a course to sail through the north sea and english channel on their way to syria loading",politicususa.com,Real,english,100.0,92.2978201200483,78,14,2233,372,4.970430107526882,372.0,0.4904476704060184,0.7374756820870908,-0.1973169010735149,-0.1947775975232092,-0.1171373464172031,-0.1877340022235924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.765,0.086,0.059,0.854,Positive,Very Strong

David G. Brown,airbnb goes full sjw and demands users host deviants of every kind in their home,"as i have repeatedly shown in my articles i am a fan of all aspects of fitnessnot just strength and developing muscular mass but also cardiovascular endurance and flexibility as well you likely knew this already
you are also likely aware that i have done several articles on stretching most recently the relax into stretch technique that i state can be used predominantly for lower body stretching such as the splits which are and will likely always be considered the benchmark of hip and leg flexibility
but what about upper body flexibility most people dont focus on that and that is just as important to train as lower body flexibility namely for purposes of increased athletic performance reduction of joint aches and pains and in some cases increased strength i have taught the readers some basic upper body stretches in the past such as the chest stretch and the door frame stretch but in my opinion if youre going to do any one stretch for upper body flexibility that would have to be the seated twist stretch
how it works this stretch involves crossing your legs in a manner that will be discussed below and twisting the torso while simultaneously locking your arm onto your bent knees this stretch will hit most of your most prominent upper body musclesthe latissimus dorsi the triceps the deltoids the obliques the neck and the pectorals
in addition to those visible muscles the twist stretch will work the deep spinal muscles  and even the muscles of the buttocks the gluteus maximus medius and minimus as well
many athletes perform the twist stretch particularly combat athletes such as wrestlers judokas and mixed martial artists that need great torso flexibility to escape from holds and pinfalls
sounds like something you ought to learn doesnt it but how

as i have happily admitted in the past and will likely do so again paul wades outstanding convict conditioning series has taught me this and many other exercises and i cannot advocate wades writing enough more specifically the twist stretch comes from convict conditioning   the first book deals with the core calisthenic seriespushups squats and the like i have already gone over these in detail in contrast the second book deals with static holds that develop strength and flexibility such as the lsit and todays topic
while the third book deals with explosive movements such as the back and front handsprings that will be a topic for another time instead lets go into the steps of the twist stretch
all of the pictures here are taken directly from the book
the exercises the first twist stretch is the easy twist stretch sit down on the floor with your feet extended take one foot and put it inside the other leg resting that foot next to the opposite knee as shown
now twist your body so the opposite shoulder turns towards the raised kneed ie if the left knee is raised turn the right shoulder and vice versa keep the foot flat on the ground and the knee stationaryjust twist the torso allow your neck to turn as it naturally wants to turn

then lock your torso by placing your elbow against the opposite side of the knee while holding your body up with the other hand
you should immediately begin to feel a stretch all around your torso
hold the stretch for  seconds for each side when this is comfortable for you move on
step  is the simple twist stretch which requires a little bit more flexibility place one foot over the other leg as shown above then take the foot that is not flat on the ground bend the leg back and touch the heel of that foot to the opposing buttock ie the right heel touches the left buttock

this foot position will be used for all twist stretches from henceforth
now as before rotate your torso towards the opposite knee right shoulder to left knee and vice versa locking yourself by placing your elbow on the opposite side of the knee and again supporting your body with the other hand hold for  seconds and move on
stretch  is where things become more difficult assume the position from stretch  but this time you will have to rotate the torso with much more force as the goal of this stretch is to extend your arm and touch the instep of the foot that is flat on the floor your arm wont be able to stretch on its own and i dont advise you try you will have to accomplish this with proper torso rotation

stretch  has the difficulty increase further get a hand towel or some other object that is about a foot long assume the stretching position and rotate the torso while holding said towel remove the supporting hand from the floor and flick the towel through the hole made by your raised leg obviously your hand is not extending down to your instep here wrapping the support hand around your back grab the other end of the towel this begins the stretch

each time you stretch you will assume this position holding the towel in two hands you will work your hands up and down the towel slowly bringing your hands together by gripping greater portions of the towel eventually you will be able to clasp fingers and that is the final level of the twist stretch

this process will be slow and arduouscoach wade himself admits that it took him the better part of a year to accomplish this by moving his fingers together inch by inch i myself am not quite at the final level yeta rough measurement shows that i have about  more inches of towel to go before my fingers touch but i have certainly noticed increased mobility and flexibility already
the towel stretch can be made easier by remembering to worm both hands up the towel not just one actively use both to secure deeper stretches and you will notice progress
doing even the easiest variations of this stretch will make you notice an immediate healing of the spine your back will deliciously crack and youll feel warm and limber afterwards and with practicing the more advanced variants you will make yourself more limber for whatever physical activity you engage in ranging from dancing to getting out of submission holds
or you could be one of millions of americans with bad backs and hips the choice is yours

Natural News Editors,dilbert creator scott adams endorses trump says hillary is a bully,"by sean colarossi on wed oct th  at  pm not even an overwhelming victory by hillary clinton is likely to convince republicans that they should do their job share on twitter print this post 
since republicans have essentially conceded that donald trump is going to lose the general election to hillary clinton theyre already making plans in the event that she decides to do her job and nominate supreme court justices 
according to a report from the huffington post on wednesday one conservative thinker says that john mccains recent suggestion that his party should block any nominee put forward by clinton isnt that farfetched 
the report 
some conservatives certainly seem to be warming up to mccains controversial suggestion last week that senate republicans should dig in their heels and block any and all supreme court nominees put forth by a future president hillary clinton 
who needs a fully functioning supreme court after all 
as a matter of constitutional law the senate is fully within its powers to let the supreme court die out literally wrote the cato institutes ilya shapiro in a column wednesday on the federalist 
shapiro is wellversed in constitutional issues and his argument has a legal if contorted basis nothing in the constitution explicitly stands in the way of senators who would be willing to destroy the nations highest court  if not an entire branch of the federal government  to stop clinton from selecting judges who share her views 
 
to shapiro theres nothing wrong with even more senate obstructionism because the constitution is completely silent on how the upper chamber provides its advice and consent on the presidents nominees 
 
so when you get past the gotcha headlines breathless reportage and inauguration day if hillary clinton is president it would be completely decent honorable and in keeping with the senates constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names he concluded 
the original argument from republicans was that they would block president obamas supreme court appointment until voters had a chance to weigh in via the nov  election forget the fact that this isnt how the constitutional system is meant to operate but that was their reasoning 
now faced with the growing prospect that hillary clinton will be elected the th president of the united states they are beginning to change their tune 
the obstruction that defined the republican party throughout obamas presidency looks like it will be sticking around after he is gone its yet another reason why downballot races are more critical than ever this year",naturalnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,5.169608718030007,66,11,2598,422,5.109004739336493,422.0,0.1235471982890264,0.1737735362073249,-0.1007482416993311,-0.1163935580200193,0.0196222250744066,-0.1075173746247402,0.0047393364928909,0.0,0.0023696682464454,0,1,0.0,0.01006570896733,0.9567,0.105,0.053,0.842,Positive,Very Strong
Daniel Greenfield,obama wont vote with america at the un,"if government can truly alleviate poverty why have leftist policies only made it worse november   thomas sowell 
the political left keeps announcing as if it is a new breakthrough discovery of theirs that life is unfair 
have they never read thomas grays elegy written in a country churchyard more than two and a half centuries ago what about economic historian david s landes statement the world has never been a level playing field 
in the joint autobiography of milton friedman and his wife rose they say everywhere in the world there are gross inequities of income and wealth they offend most of us few can fail to be moved by the contrast between the luxury enjoyed by some and the grinding poverty suffered by others 
moreover professor friedman left behind a foundation dedicated to promoting school choice so that disadvantaged children could get a better education for a better chance in life 
what is it that the political left is saying that they think is so new such a breakthrough and such a necessity for progress more important what test of evidence  if any  have they ever subjected their notions to 
no one has presented the social vision of the left more often than nicholas kristof of the new york times  and no one has been more certain that those who do not happen to share his vision just dont get it as he has repeatedly declared 
mr kristofs essay growing up poor in america in the october th new york times is a classic example of the mindset of the left 
it begins with the story of a poor black teenager in arkansas being raised by a single mom sometimes he goes hungry and his home does not have even one book but it does have television sets with huge screens and apparently there is money enough to buy marijuana 
surely we can all agree that this young fellow has very unpromising future prospects ahead of him and that this is a human tragedy the circumstances of his life are unfair to him and none of us would want to be born into such circumstances moreover he is just one of many who are brought up in a setting that is full of dangers and with a low probability of improvement 
but that is not enough for mr kristof or for the political left in general of such youngsters he says as a society we fail them long before they fail us 
whoa just when did society make the decisions and engage in the actions that have led to this teenager being in the bad situation he is in and just when did society acquire either the omniscience or the omnipotence to prevent it 
when the left says society they usually mean government that is apparently what society means in this case for kristof laments that this teenager is the kind of person whom americas presidential candidates just dont talk about 
if the left chooses to believe that government intervention is the answer to such tragedies that is their right but if they expect the rest of us to share that belief surely they could subject that belief to some empirical test but we can however 
the s were the triumphant decade of those who wanted government intervention to solve what they called social problems how did that work out what were things like before this social vision triumphed and what were things like afterwards 
homicide victimization rates among black males were going down substantially in the s and the s but homicide victimization rates reversed and skyrocketed in the s wiping out all the progress of the two previous decades 
when the s began most black children were born into families with both a mother and a father after the great welfare state expansion during the s most black children were born to a single mother like the youngster in arkansas today 
kristofs essay also mentions a teenage girl who is a single mother and suggests that sex education could have prevented her from getting pregnant teenage pregnancy was going down  repeat down  during the s it reversed and shot up after the s began bringing the sex education vision into schools across the country 
very similar trends occurred in england after very similar visions and policies also triumphed there in the s perhaps it is the left that just doesnt get it  or cannot face the hard fact that its own vision and policies worsened the very things they claimed would be made better",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,38,8,4258,757,4.591809775429327,757.0,-0.7325539033172883,-0.3899286096724409,0.3384407297010665,0.4087795066513533,-0.4907984826547047,0.4299340302875693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.8817,0.122,0.101,0.777,Positive,Very Strong

snip according to misao dean professor of english at the university of victoria the canoe can be a symbol of colonialism imperialism and genocide due to history she also accused the canoers of cultural appropriation because they are primarily white men and have a privileged place in society 
in a radio interview for cbc radio  which wasnt picked up by the internet until several months later she claimed we have a whole set of narratives that make the canoe into a kind of morally untouchable symbol something that seems natural that seems ordinary and seems to promote values that we ascribe to 
but i think if you look a little further that narrative obscures or erases another narrativeand that narrative is about to be blunt its about theft and genocide the professor said 
snip 
its not a coincidence that it was white men of a certain age    certainly the majority of wilderness canoers are people who have a very privileged place in society theyre frequently highly educated people theyre almost completely white she said 
cbc radio host jim brown then asked a question should we look at the canoe as a noncontroversial symbol or should we look at it as a symbol of colonialism 
to which the academic replied absolutely a symbol of colonialism it seems to me that this narrative we tell ourselves about the canoe about how canoeing makes us in touch with nature how canoeing makes us in some way guiltless of the terrible things that the canadian government and canadians in general did to first nations people

Anonymous,no title,"breaking bombshell fbi nypd insiders leak  email scandal about to take a sick and twisted turn    
source victurus libertas  


all of the following information was given to us by our insiders who have specific firsthand knowledge of the hillary clinton email scandal it seems that things are about to heat up we are told that of the  emails lifted from anthony weiners computer  emails are huma abedins and pay to play  including saudis and israelis meaning huma was the one hillary used to communicate with foreign leaders via email for inside information and deals via humas computer 

it has been established through many avenues but mainly through wikileaks that the clinton foundation was just a farce set up in order to perform paytoplay games with multiple entities including foreign nations paytoplay nations include israel saudi arabia turkey qatar kazakhstan and the ukraine 
furthermore we are told by one of our insiders that one email unequivocally confirms isis was created by cia and israeli secret intelligence service  with help from joe lieberman john mccain and lindsey graham an nypd insider said the content they viewed did include state department top secret emails one file was called life insurance a second file was titled  dnc nuclear arsenal  

a third file im sure hillary definitely does not want released was a file labeled intimate  according to this nypd insider this file contained xrated photos of huma and hillary with a teenager  

nypd detectives were sickened by what they saw according to our insider and they had threatened fbi field agents that they would leak this information if the fbi did not step up and take off the kid gloves  at that point  of the fbi agents in nyc were also threatening to leak the information 

as you can imagine the scandal has the entire obama administration in full panic we are told there are emails that could send loretta lynch to prison  as well as bill and hillary the twitter post below our sources sent us verifying it is all true 




even more 

the following information comes straight from an fbi anonymous source who is the senior analyst who posted on chan in early july of this year 

jim comey learned that some of his own investigators were tipping off both loretta lynch and bill clinton thus making his job impossible 

comey sent a letter to congress knowing that ultimately it would expose loretta lynch as a dirty actor and the breadcrumbs would lead directly to obama  the state department is terrified now comey has assembled a small team of  agents whom he has declared the untouchables after the famous federal agent eliot ness 

comey has clamped down on all fbi agents and he expects a fullscale war between the fbi and the department of justice doj the white house and the state department he has confirmed and understands that many sitting senators congressmen lobbyists and power players are going to be indicted and prosecuted  one of the main targets of the probe is the clinton foundation and clinton global initiative among the targets under investigation are john podesta huma cheryl mills cnn abc nbc etc 

as it turns out weiner humas husband had been forwarding humas emails each time she came home and left her computer open huma appears to have been in touch with saudi actors and therefore espionage is strongly suspected 
comey and his   untouchables  are now preparing to take down the largest corruption ever witnessed in american history which is what i think must happen if comey is planning to stay part of the fbi he lost so much respect and so much credibility with the first hillary investigation it would take something of this magnitude to allow him to face the public again the pentagon has internal players and outside players they call  creatives  creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses malcontents extreme hackers or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in other useful areas a pentagon program called cicada   which we have reported on previously was created by several of these talented civilians the program is now used to allow thousands of honest government people to report on their corrupt superiors using what is called a dead box whistleblower encryption method so the noncorrupted government officials can report corruption and still remain safe 

ive heard it said a vagina almost took down bill now will a weiner take down hillary lol 

again thank you to all of the insiders the whistleblowers the good fbi agents the good cia agents the good nypd officers and the noncorrupted government officials who want to see the truth exposed without these brave wonderful and morally erect individuals our country would still be in the corrupted darkness

Alex Ansary,hillary clinton in lead a day before election day," quake near oklahoma oil hub causes substantial damage  
cbs 
a magnitude  earthquake centered near one of the worlds key oil hubs brought down building facades and shattered windows in a central oklahoma city rendering centuryold buildings unsafe and raising concerns about key infrastructure 
as the sun rose monday television news footage showed widespread substantial damage to buildings with piles of bricks and other debris littering the ground following the earthquake the previous evening cushing assistant city manager jeremy frazier told a news conference late sunday that a few minor injuries had been reported he said the damage appeared to be contained downtown 
oklahoma has had thousands of earthquakes in recent years with nearly all traced to the underground injection of wastewater left over from oil and gas production sundays quake was centered  mile west of cushing and about  miles south of where a magnitude  quake forced a shutdown of several wells last week 
fearing aftershocks police cordoned off older parts of the city to keep gawkers away late sunday and geologists confirmed that several small quakes have rumbled the area frazier said an assisted living community had been evacuated after damage was reported the cushing public school district canceled monday classes 
stay out of the area said city manager steve spears who noted that while some damage was superficial compromised foundations and other potential problems would be difficult to assess until daylight in the city of  about  miles northeast of oklahoma city 
the oklahoma department of transportation reported sunday night that no highway or bridge damage was found within a mile radius of the earthquakes epicenter 
the quake struck at  pm sunday and was felt as far away as iowa illinois and texas the us geological survey initially said sundays quake was of magnitude  but later lowered the reading to  
i thought my whole trailer was going to tip over it was shaking it so bad said cushing resident cindy roe  it was loud and all the lights went out and you could hear things falling on the ground 
it was awful and i dont want to have another one 
cushings oil storage terminal is one of the worlds largest as of oct  tank farms in the countryside around cushing held  million barrels of crude oil according to data from the us energy information administration the community bills itself as the pipeline crossroads of the world 
frazier said two pipeline companies had reported no trouble as of late sunday but that the community hadnt heard from all companies gov mary fallin tweeted that no damage was reported at the storage tanks at cushings oil storage terminal 
megan gustafson and jonathan gillespie were working at a cushing mcdonalds when the quake hit 
it felt like a train was going right through the building actually gustafson  said sunday night as she and her coworkers stood behind a police barricade downtown looking for damage i kind of freaked out and was hyperventilating a bit 
gillespie said the building shook for about  seconds but that he wasnt as alarmed as gustafson because he lives in an area that has experienced multiple earthquakes especially in recent years 
i didnt think it was anything new he said 
according to usgs data there have been about two dozen earthquakes in oklahoma in the past week when particularly strong quakes hit the oklahoma corporation commission directs well operators to cease wastewater injections or reduce volume 
a  earthquake  a record for oklahoma  hit pawnee on sept  shortly afterward geologists speculated on whether the temblor occurred on a previously unknown fault

Mike Adams,associated press reporter admits faking news stories for hillary clinton stunning admission reveals how ap prints whatever the clintons want facts be damned,"by sarah jones on fri oct th  at  pm matthew miller self described recovering flack from doj dscc schooled republican fbi director james comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within  days of an election share on twitter print this post 
former doj spokesman for eric holder matthew miller a self described recovering flack from doj dscc schooled republican fbi director james comey for violating his power and lambasted him for commenting on a case within  days of an election 
the department and the fbi have very strict rules about when they can comment on ongoing cases and director comey has violated those rules going back to his original press conference when he closed the case miller said on cnn but this latest example violates a long standing practice which is that the department goes out of its way not to do anything that can be seen as trying to influence an election in the closing days of an election and usually they interpret the closing days to be seen as the last  days let alone the last  days 
watch here 
miller also held school on twitter about comeys abuse of power which has led to hillary clinton having to defend against a negative i wrote a piece in july on why comeys public comments about clinton were such an inappropriate abuse of power  httpstcogcrozqwz 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   he flagrantly violated doj rules with his press conference then went on to break new ground discussing details of the case to congress 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   followed by quickly releasing fbi s something they rarely do and which i doubt they will do for future highprofile cases  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   each time he either violated or seriously stretched doj rule  precedent press conference was the original sin  it begat the rest  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   but todays disclosure might be worst abuse yet doj goes out of its way to avoid publicly discussing investigations close to election  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   not just public discussion either often wont send subpoenas or take other steps that might leak until after an election is over 
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   why because voters have no way to interpret fbidoj activity in a neutral way who is the target of an investigation what conduct  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   this might be totally benign  not even involve clinton but no way for press or voters to know that easy for opponent to make hay over  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   which takes us back to the original rule you dont comment on ongoing investigations then multiply that times ten close to an election  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   for whatever reason  there are many theories comey continues to ignore that but only for clinton  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   fbi is undoubtedly investigating links between the russian hack manafort  the trump campaign but arent commenting on it good  
 matthew miller matthewamiller october   
miller points out this just smells worse and worse the more we learn linking to this emails were not to or from clinton and appeared like info fbi already had wtf httpstcoysjwfwgzi 
 ken gude kengude october   
the problem with comeys actions isnt that he is investigating hillary clinton the problem is he is violating long standing rules that prohibit federal employees from doing anything that could be seen as political near an election it is an established rule that ongoing investigations arent commented on for obvious reasons 
this is quite simply not done comeys reasons for doing this are unclear and perhaps when he provides more information his decision will make more sense but its troubling that we are seeing such a consistent breakdown of tradition and rulesagreements of law surrounding the trump campaign which seems to have lowered the bar all around

living in newark new jersey my parents and i consumed anything and everything that had a face or a mother except for dead rotting pig bodies although we did eat bacon as if all the other decomposing flesh bodies were somehow miraculously clean going through high school and college it was no different in fact my dietary change did not come until i was in my s 
just to put things in perspective after i graduated from weequahic high school and before going to seton hall university i had a parttime job working for a butcher i was the delivery guy and occasionally had to go to the slaughterhouse to pick up products for the store needless to say i had no consciousness nor awareness as change never came then despite the horrors i witnessed on an almost daily basis 
after graduating with a degree in accounting from seton hall i eventually got married and moved to a town called livingston livingston was basically a yuppie community where everyone was judged by the neighborhood they lived in and their income to say it was a plastic community would be an understatement 
livingston and the shallowness finally got to me i told my wife i was fed up and wanted to move she made it clear she had to be near her friends and new york city i finally got my act together and split for colorado 
i was living with a lady in aspen at the end of  when one day she said  lets become vegetarians i have no idea what possessed me to say it but i said okay 
at that point i went to the freezer and took out about  worth of frozen dead body parts and gave them to a welfare mother who lived behind us 
well everything was great for about a week or so and then the chick split with another guy 
so here i was a vegetarian for a couple weeks not really knowing what to do how to cook or basically how to prepare anything for about a month i was getting by on carrot sticks celery sticks and yogurt fortunately when i went vegan in  it was a simple and natural progression anyway as i walked around aspen town i noticed a little vegetarian restaurant called the little kitchen 
let me back up just a little bit it was april of  the snow was melting and the runoff of ajax mountain filled the streets full of kneedeep mud now aspen was great to ski in but was a bummer to walk in when the snow was melting 
i was ready to call it quits and i needed a warmer place ill elaborate on that in a minute 
but right now back to the little kitchen knowing that i was going to leave aspen and basically a new vegetarian i needed help so i cruised into the restaurant and told them my plight and asked them if they would teach me how to cook i told them in return i would wash dishes and empty their trash they then asked me what i did for a living and i told them i was an accountant 
the owner said to me lets make a deal you do our tax return and well feed you as well so for the next couple of weeks i was doing their tax return washing their dishes emptying the trash eating three squares a day and learning as much as i could 
but like i said the mud was getting to me so i picked up a travel book written by a guy named foder the name of the book was hawaii looking through the book i noticed that in lahaina on maui there was a little vegetarian restaurant called mr naturals i decided right then and there that i would go to lahaina and work at mr naturals to make a long story short thats exactly what happened 
so im working at mr naturals and learning everything i can about my new dietary lifestyle  it was great every afternoon we would close for lunch at about  pm and go to the sheraton hotel in kaanapali and play volleyball while somebody stayed behind to prepare dinner 
since i was the new guy and didnt really know how to cook i never thought that i would be asked to stay behind to cook dinner well one afternoon thats exactly what happened it was my turn that posed a problem for me because i was at the point where i finally knew how to boil water 
i was desperate clueless and basically up the creek without a paddle fortunately there was a friend of mine sitting in the gazebo at the restaurant and i asked him if he knew how to cook he said the only thing he knew how to cook was enchiladas he said that his enchiladas were beanless and dairyless i told him that i had no idea what an enchilada was or what he was talking about but i needed him to show me because it was my turn to do the evening meal 
well the guys came back from playing volleyball and im asked what was for dinner i told them enchiladas the owner wasnt thrilled i told him that mine were beanless and dairyless when he tried the enchilada he said it was incredible being the humble guy that i was i smiled and said you expected anything less it apparently was so good that it was the only item on the menu that we served twice a week in fact after about a week we were selling five dozen every night we had them on the menu and people would walk around lahaina broadcasting enchiladas at naturals tonight i never had to cook anything else 
a year later the restaurant closed and somehow i gravitated to a little health food store in wailuku i never told anyone i was an accountant and basically relegated myself to being the truck driver 
the guys who were running the health food store had friends in similar businesses and farms on many of the islands i told them that if they could organize and form one company they could probably lock in the state thats when they found out i was an accountant and down to earth was born down to earth became the largest natural food store chain in the islands and i was their chief financial officer and comanager of their biggest store for  years 
in  i started to do a weekly radio show to try and expose people to a vegetarian diet and get them away from killing innocent creatures i still do that show today i pay for my own airtime and have no sponsors to not compromise my honesty one bit of a hassle was the fact that i was forced to get a masters degree in nutrition to shut up all the mds that would call in asking for my credentials 
my doing this radio show enabled me through endless research to see the corruption that existed within the big food industries the big pharmaceutical companies the biotech industries and the government agencies 
this information unconscionable as it is enabled me to realize how broken our health system is 
i left down to earth in  got nationally certified as a sports injury massage therapist and started traveling the world with a bunch of guys that were making a martial arts movie after doing that for about four years i finally made it back to honolulu and got a job as a massage therapist at the honolulu club one of hawaiis premier fitness clubs 
it was there i met the love of my life who i have been with since  she made me an offer i couldnt refuse she said if you want to be with me youve got to stop working on naked women so i went back into accounting and was the chief financial officer of a large construction company for many years 
going back to my newark days when i was an infant i had no idea what a chicken or egg or fish or pig or cow was my dietary blueprint was thrust upon me by my parents as theirs was thrust upon them by their parents it was by the grace of god that i was able to put things in their proper perspective and improve my health and elevate my consciousness 
the road that i started walking down in  has finally led me to the point of writing my book a sane diet for an insane world hopefully the information contained therein will be enlightening motivating and inspiring to encourage you to make different choices 
doing what we do out of conditioning is not always the best course to follow i am hoping that by the grace of the many friends and personalities i have encountered along my path you will have a better perspective of what road is the best road for you to travel on not only for your health but your consciousness as well

university of california 
dear dr napolitano 
your school purports to promote the values of diversity inclusiveness and tolerance yet provides resources funding and legitimacy to students for justice in palestine students for justice in palestine is a campus organization whose sole purpose is to conduct hateful propaganda against jews and the jewish state for the terrorist organization hamas the explicit goals of hamas are the destruction of the worlds only jewish state and genocide against its jewish population for these reasons among others three campuses of the university of californiairvine los angeles and berkeleyhave been named among the top ten schools supporting terrorists by the david horowitz freedom center you may read the full report here httpwwwstopthejewhatredoncampusorgnewstoptenschoolssupportingterroristsfallreport 
while it masquerades as a typical campus cultural group sjp is an integral part of hamass efforts to annihilate israel through the boycott divestment and sanctions bds campaign this is an insidious effort that attempts to delegitimize israel and smear it as a rogue apartheid nation these claims are ludicrous more than a million palestinians enjoy israeli citizenship including the rights to vote and to sit on the israeli courts and parliament harvard professor alan dershowitz has said of the bds movement it is antisemitic antizionist antihuman rights antiintellectual antiscience antinegotiation antipeace anticompromise and antipalestinian workers when they are denied opportunities to work both larry summers and hillary clinton have denounced bds as antisemitic jew hatred yet your school provides a platform and funding for its sponsors 
with university support sjp also conducts israeli apartheid hate weeks on campus quads these events feature prohamas advocates the construction of apartheid walls featuring prohamas antisemitic propaganda and the creation of mock checkpoints and dieins that disrupt student movements on campus sjp actively disrupts proisrael campus eventsa threat to free speech and a violation of your universitys stated values and rules of conduct 
in addition to being scripted by hamas terrorists sjps proterror campaign is funded and guided through a hamas front called american muslims for palestine in recent testimony before the house foreign affairs committee jonathan schanzer who worked as a terrorism finance analyst for the united states department of the treasury from  described how hamas funnels large sums of money and provides material assistance to students for justice in palestine sjp through the hamas front group american muslims for palestine amp for the purpose of promoting bds campaigns on american campuses amp was created by sjp cofounder hatem bazian a proterrorist lecturer at uc berkeley who called for a suicide bombing intifada inside the united states it employs highranking officials from other muslim charities that were previously shut down for providing material assistance to terrorists 
schanzer described amp as arguably the most important sponsor and organizer for students for justice in palestine sjp which is the most visible arm of the bds campaign on campuses in the united states he detailed how amp provides speakers training printed materials a socalled apartheid wall and grants to sjp activists and even has a campus coordinator on staff whose job is to work directly with sjp and other probds campus groups across the country furthermore according to an email it sent to subscribers amp spent  on campus activities in  alone 
students for justice in palestine continues to accept funding and aid through the hamas front group american muslims for palestine despite its links to terrorist organizations and agendas students for justice in palestine continues to receive campus funds and campus privileges including university offices and the right to hold events preaching the genocidal values of hamas on university property these privileges would normally be denied to groups that preach hatred of any other ethnic group let alone one that supports barbaric terrorists who slaughter men women and children with the goal of cleansing the earth of people who disagree with them 
in light of these facts we ask that you withdraw all university privileges granted to sjp and other campus groups who promote the genocidal hamas agenda and that you put an end to the terrorist influences which have infiltrated your campus and which threaten the security not only of jewish students on your campus but of all americans

Sarah Jones,mike pence is fine with trump sexual assault but offended by voter suppression,"by sean colarossi on mon oct st  at  pm while the media continues to focus on the clinton email nonstory news about donald trumps ties to russia continues to gain steam share on twitter print this post 
while the media continues to focus on what is increasingly becoming a nonstory  fbi director james comeys vague letter regarding more emails related to hillary clinton  news about donald trumps ties to russia continues to gain steam 
not only did nbc just report that the fbi is now in the preliminary stages of investigating trumps excampaign managers connection to russia but slate also reported on monday that a trump server may have repeatedly been communicating with a russian bank 
slate claims that while a group of computer scientists was looking into the russian cyber attack of the dnc they stumbled onto something unexpectedly 
the report 
in late july one of these scientistswho asked to be referred to as tea leaves a pseudonym that would protect his relationship with the networks and banks that employ him to sift their datafound what looked like malware emanating from russia the destination domain had trump in its name which of course attracted tea leaves attention but his discovery of the data was pure happenstancea surprising needle in a large haystack of dns lookups on his screen i have an outlier here that connects to russia in a strange way he wrote in his notes he couldnt quite figure it out at first but what he saw was a bank in moscow that kept irregularly pinging a server registered to the trump organization on fifth avenue 
more data was needed so he began carefully keeping logs of the trump servers dns activity as he collected the logs he would circulate them in periodic batches to colleagues in the cybersecurity world six of them began scrutinizing them for clues 
the researchers quickly dismissed their initial fear that the logs represented a malware attack the communication wasnt the work of bots the irregular pattern of server lookups actually resembled the pattern of human conversationconversations that began during office hours in new york and continued during office hours in moscow it dawned on the researchers that this wasnt an attack but a sustained relationship between a server registered to the trump organization and two servers registered to an entity called alfa bank 
this news doesnt come out of nowhere trump has repeatedly praised vladimir putin as a strong leader all while taking prorussia positions throughout the campaign that come straight off a kremlin wishlist 
the clinton campaign was quick to jump on the report in a statement by clinton senior policy adviser jake sullivan 
this secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of trumps ties to russia it certainly seems the trump organization felt it had something to hide given that it apparently took steps to conceal the link when it was discovered by journalists 
this line of communication may help explain trumps bizarre adoration of vladimir putin and endorsement of so many prokremlin positions throughout this campaign it raises even more troubling questions in light of russias masterminding of hacking efforts that are clearly intended to hurt hillary clintons campaign we can only assume that federal authorities will now explore this direct connection between trump and russia as part of their existing probe into russias meddling in our elections 
trumps prorussia rhetoric and policy positions are not a coincidence the more information that comes out the clearer it is that the republican nominee has connections to russia that he is hiding from voters

No Author,glp forum godlike productions,"disclaimer this is not legal advice if you are charged with a criminal offense or think that you may be contact your attorney 
if you are a western man under  your world view when it comes to sex was forged in the era of internet pornography epic divorce rates hypersexualized television content and a political climate of anything goes sexual identity at virtually any age you could be forgiven for thinking that when you first had sex with your sweetheart back in high school or earlier it wasnt something remarkable and youve both probably forgotten about it years later you could also be one accusation away from defending yourself in a sex offense case
while american culture evolved or as many fairly and convincingly argue de volved into a sexually open environment where there are few if any societal and legal restrictions beyond those involving children and animals statutory rape is still caught in a complex patchwork of state based laws
federal law does not stipulate a universal age of consent instead leaving it to the states to codify though you are safe everywhere in north america by avoiding all girls under  and you may think thats the law of the land federal statutes principally refer to matters surrounding pornographic material and prostitution by the wayyou didnt take any naked selfies or make a homemade porno with her right good thing you didnt because you could have violated that federal law about pornography 
what is the age of consent in america i wouldnt even trust her fake id
the age for private consensual sexual acts in america ranges from  to   sometimes lower in the case of married couples its even lower in some foreign countries by the way say youre an american student overseas with a foreign girlfriend whos legal in her country but still under you might want to check with a knowledgable lawyer before getting down a d dirty
why is this significant for starters the un convention on the rights of the child considers anyone under the age of  to be a child that magic number is also used to prosecute anyone going overseas with the intent to have sex with a minor while us law in this area is aimed at pedophiles and traffickers theres no reason it could not be applied to a young man on a trip to cancun or studying abroad in eastern europe the most likely situation for a young american male will be domestic however
dont take one for the team
for example back when you were  and your girlfriend was  and the age of consent in your state was  you might have both been well aware of what you were doing and done it several timesperhaps even with the knowledge and approval of your parents you may have stayed with her for years and eventually got married but more than likely you and she parted ways and havent looked back since
till one day you get a knock at your door from a policeman who wants to question you about your relationship a few years earlier thinking nothing of it you tell him the basic details admitting to sexual contact and bam you are arrested for statutory rape of a minor any defense of her consenting multiple times or even that you did not know she was underage is irrelevantas a minor she cannot consent and because of this she may have no say in whether or not to press charges
the long arm of the law may reach you 
well thats no bother to me since it was so long ago and the statute of limitations passed anyway right not so fast first if you have amassed any assets years later she could still decide to sue you in civil court for damages although this is not always successful  and either win at trial or eke out a monetary settlement from you even absent a criminal conviction or a civil court judgement against you having to pay a settlement for a sex assault related case is something no man wants on his resume just ask bill clinton 
moreover just because it is now beyond the statute of limitations for prosecuting you do not assume you are in the clear statutes of limitations can be changed  once again including accused offenders even though they were previously beyond the statute of limitations any statements you may have made to law enforcement before this happens would once again be fair game
while the intent of changes to these laws is noblethey want to nail child abusers who got away for decadesthe reality is you can get scooped up into the mix if you as a teenager once had a sexual encounter of any kind with an underage girl perhaps even if you yourself were underage if you think you engaged in a situation where you could be charged the best course of action is to clam up and consult lawyer in your jurisdiction
this applies even more if one day you are approached by anyone and out of the blue they bring up the subject even though youd nearly forgotten about it if you get arrested and charged but the prosecuting attorney decides to not prosecute continue to keep quiet regardless prosecutors come and go and a replacement with a political agenda could perhaps decide to reopen your case and pursue charges
branded for life 
if you get charged but by some miracle are able to cop a plea and get probation with no jail time you will probably still wind up in a sex offender registry  perhaps for life say you get luckier still and serious doubts surface about the veracity of the story and eventually the charges are reduced or dropped completely resulting in no conviction and no sex offender registry requirement for you well guess what you will still have an arrest record for a sex offense on your rap sheetit matters not that there was no conviction
imagine driving down the road years later a cop drives up behind you and automatically scans your license plate as is now common practice a sex offense arrest pops up think you stand a good chance of getting pulled over for further scrutiny what are the chances youre going away with a warning instead of a ticket that day for better or worse cop instinct is to view arrests the same as they would a conviction so its best to keep all arrests completely out of your life as much as possible
you will get no breaks so watch yourself and stfu yes of course you both knew what you were doing back on prom night and yes we know grown women teachers who have sex with minors often are convicted at trial and still receive no jail sentences  but you sir are a heterosexual man acting out on your urges and therefore a prime targetdoubly so if youre white nonislamic and attending college or boarding school particularly a prestigious institution  forewarned is forearmed
young men need to be well aware of the laws in their state before engaging in any sexual contact in situations where they could face a statutory rape accusation and if youve got a story or two from back in your glory days as the high school quarterback with the freshman cheerleader dont tell that story to anyone ever the political climate is not favorable to youand it could stay that way for a while absent a much needed reality check

do not forgive the msm 

the msm turned on hillary the fbi turned on hillary want to know why because in florida where they flipped a huge number of votes trump still had  percent of the vote nationwide they did not have the vote scam machines everywhere and when that got averaged in trump took  percent of the votes nationwide even with the stolen votes subtracted from the average the fbi fox cnn everyone else knew the gig was up and is now only moving to say sorry so they dont go to jail 

well ive got news for you they are still the same lying despicable malfunctioning trash scum they always were they showed their worth and we would be idiots to forgive them no matter how badly they burn hillary 

cnn is despicable trash we all witnessed it never forgive them  because they have proven their worth already no matter what they do they cant recover from what they have done they are garbage a disease bleachworthy filth and i hope trump erases them ditto for all of the rest of the msm including the huffington post snopes abccbsfoxyounameit  all of them are the lowest of filth that is now heading for the darkness of the nearest sewer to get away from the coming bulldozer 

the fbi is a trash agency along with the rest of american intelligence which only works to serve the enemy for as long as it thinks its head will not be cut off all of the fbi must be disbanded and everyone in the fbi should be blackballed and never allowed to work again with the top echelons jailed for life for treason they lied about  and they knew it  and have proven they serve one purpose to protect evil ditto for the cia the nsa the dhs the tsa and all the rest of the trash all of it needs to go there is not one fragment of it that should be salvaged 

so they are all running like rats for cover they know they blew it they know they are going to be bagged for heinous crimes against america now they are putting on the biggest fakest show the world will ever witness as if they cared they never did care and i hope to god trump has a memory longer than the average jarhead and bags every last one of them when he has his day they had better run for the gates and ditch the country just like they said they would if he got elected  because if not they are heading straight to the gates of justice 

i would like to thank everyone in the altmedia who made this happen and i would also like to say that i said it all along as it was and never backed off hillary never had more than  percent national support this is something i said repeatedly that trump was always  percent supported and i never wavered and never once posted bullshit like oh lets rejoice trump is at  percent that was always a trap  a scam to justify stealing the election  and i called it as it was 

our job is not over 

the rot is there it is deeply rooted with fungus roots running all the way through the country one bottle of bleach is not going to do more than spotclean the surface we won this battle and it is not time to sit down the altmedia cannot rest until cnn and all of the rest of the msm is either bankrupted or jailed the altmedia cannot rest for as long as google is allowed to wage war on websites like this one by refusing to allow it ads if this website were allowed ads it would easily selffund with  plus per month and would probably have more than  per month denial of ads just because someone disagrees and has a monopoly established via full control of various ad firms is a flagrant violation of antitrust laws and has to be stopped dead cold 

the altmedia cannot stop until every last criminal in the fbi is jailed by the fbi i am sick of the bait tactics and false flag psyops fronted by that agency heads have got to roll piles of them especially since it has been proven that it was the fbi itself that did the first world trade center bombing with the full intent to bring one of the towers down thats the type of agency that has got to be shuttered  or we are all toast trump or not yeah i know you at the fbi are reading this go to hell 

our job will not be over until the cia is cleaned out our job is not over until the american bar association is disbanded as the criminal bloodsucking hive it is our job is not over until the top executives at the medical companies that produced the tainted autisminflicting vaccines hang with stretched necks our job will not be over until every last liberal arts and womens studies department of all universities have their staffs jailed for treason they gutted the home front in a manner which was horrific beyond belief our job is not over until all of americas great libraries are fully restored after being totally wiped out by the jews and all scientific journals and works once again become fully free and public domain our job will not be over until the childsnatching cps is shut down and their feed for their slave trade is cut off our job will not be over until american corporations begin to fight for america and bring our jobs and american quality back 

the list of what the altmedia needs to accomplish now that it appears the first huge battle has been won is practically endless but i believe the altmedia is up to the task and will succeed as long as one thing is cemented in stone 



julian assange is obviously dead 

consider these facts and then figure the odds of him being alive 

 wikileaks dns server was suddenly pointed elsewhere thats right that night in the wee hours of the morning after pamela was there to poison him police in an armored vehicle showed up at the embassy and that night the dns server pointed to a different ip address for wikileaks and google updated everything instantly so the transfer was completely seamless from the real wikileaks server to the fake wikileaks server that was at a completely different ip address 

 mr assanges subsequent tweets were noticeably more hostile and attacked his most loyal supporters i reported this repeatedly 

 mr assanges tweets regularly misspelled the names of some of his closest friends whom he has known for decades gavin mcfadyen became mcfayden for example mcfadyen  the director of wikileaks was found dead three days after assange started having mystery problems this is something i made a huge issue of here 

 streams of disinformation were spewed 

 themes supported by mr assange for years were then knocked down or discredited by his subsequent tweets and communications very bad timing with that everyone with a brain noticed this and it lit up the forums and blogs 

 body double rumors have been circulated and documented 

 new strange hitherto unknown moderators of wikileaks have suddenly been installed 

 his deadman switch was activated before the armored vehicle even showed up at the embassy which means assange probably manually triggered it after he figured out he was poisoned much of his stored data and secret website pins were to be released in the event of his untimely death i released both deadman switches here one encrypted and one unencrypted 

all of this happened right after pamela anderson showed up with a lunch that was no doubt poisoned and the media talked all about how assange was pale and not feeling well when she left and that he said the food pamela brought him was torture good for a laugh in the inside circles to have this go out on the msm no doubt 

my take assange was poisoned and then removed from the embassy in an armored vehicle this was clearly visible in a live feed someone set up that night because something was amiss and i saw that and stayed up the entire night for it that is why i so strongly stated that he cant possibly still be at the embassy perhaps he got medical care to save him and is now being waterboarded 

if the new wikileak releases are real they are not coming from the wikileaks server  only a redirect to a different server in the name of wikileaks the ip address change proves it and we can only hope it is white hats doing it it seems so but one can only guess

David G. Brown,stockholms feminist snow removal program causes the entire city to shut down,"home  badge abuse  leaked soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police leaked soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police matt agorist august    comments 
memos and documents published by dcleaks continue shedding light on billionaire globalist george soros and his progressive organization open society foundations osf due to their poor digital curation however the leaks are hard to comb through which is leading to the information slowly trickling out the latest of the documents reveals the billionaires attempt to organize a national movement to create a federalized police force 
the document shows that osf saw the killings of mike brown eric garner walter scott and freddie gray as an opportunity to implement this mission of federal police guidelines osf according to the documents then held a meeting titled police reform how to take advantage of the crisis of the moment and drive longterm institutional change in policecommunity practice 
the memo further documents that sorosfinanced groups and personalities influenced a task force on st century policing created by president obama last may the task force released a final report consisting of  recommendations recommending protocol to local departments on how to modify policing practices 
the information is from a page report of an open society us programs board meeting that took place in new york city in may of last year 
states the board meeting document 
the federal government is seeking philanthropic support for a number of its initiatives in addition to seeking support to advance the implementation of the recommendations of the presidential taskforce the white house recently launched the policing data initiative to explore how best to use data and technology to build trust voice and solutions to improve community policing the department of justice recently selected the first six cities to host pilot sites for the national initiative for building community trust and justice which was launched last fall to help repair and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve by exploring strategies intended to enhance procedural justice reduce implicit bias and support racial reconciliation 
we are gaining a better understanding of these efforts in order to determine how best usp can use this moment to create a national movement we have already had a set of preliminary conversations with about a dozen key stakeholders and will undertake a field scan to map the areas of work currently underway to advance police reform including an assessment of the redundancies and gaps in work and opportunities for collaboration as we proceed we will engage the funder network we helped to establish the executive alliance on men and boys of color which now includes forty foundations 
us programs usp is a part of osf with the stated mission of working to further a vibrant democratic society in which all people can meaningfully participate in its civic economic and political life 
according to the above excerpt usp was thinking of ways to capitalize on police killings to create a national movement to implement their agenda 
the think tank also raises the question of how to properly steer the ostensible grassroots organizations such as black lives matter to achieve usp goals 
the events of the past several months have understandably led to a wide range of activities including a variety of advocacy efforts to respond to the significant challenges in policing that have been exposed and the opportunity to promote meaningful and lasting change for example organized under the banner of the civil rights coalition on police reform organizations like the lawyers committee for civil rights under the law lcchr and ldf are advocating for federal reform efforts with a particular emphasis on data collection and transparency and as noted above  effecting federal funding streams a variety of other national advocacy organizations including grantees advancement project policylink the center for popular democracy and the aclu are working to provide advocates with toolkits and resources to help their organizing efforts locally based groups such as the ohio student association the organization for black struggle the asian law caucus and the aclu of new jersey to name a few are advocating for specific reforms at the city and state levels another layer of grassroots and youthoriented groups like freedom side ferguson action black lives matter and million hoodies movement for justice are also advocating for specific reforms the range of efforts underway raises a number of questions and concerns about capacity the need for coordination and the appropriate prioritization of policy objectives among others which we will discuss in the policing portion of the meeting 
while the intentions of reforming police in america seem noble the very idea of a sorosled initiative is chilling 
another memo leaked earlier this month showed the billionaire was potentially funding the black lives matter movement  to the tune of  now as todays memo shows we know why 
as the free thought project has pointed out many times before soros has been exposed literally manipulating the world 
earlier this month in an email found within the wikileaks hillary clinton archive with the subject unrest in albania soros makes clear to clinton that two things need to be done urgently he then directs the secretary of state to bring the full weight of the international community to bear on prime minister berisha and appoint a senior european official as mediator revealing the influence he wields within the corridors of power soros then provides secretary of state clinton with three names from which to choose unsurprisingly clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials recommended by soros  miroslav lajcak 
this is standard operating procedure for soros anyone familiar with the history of the soros open society foundations in eastern europe and around the world since the late s will know that his supposedly philanthropic democracybuilding projects in poland russia or ukraine in the s allowed soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries wealth according to the new eastern outlook  
sorosaffiliated organizations are deeply connected to numerous color revolutions such as the arab spring and a number of other uprisings across the world they have been intimately involved in the coup that took place in ukraine and subsequent ratcheting up of cold war tensions with russia 
as these leaked memos and emails prove the united states is nothing more than one of soros pawns 
while americans remain oblivious and argue over straw men fed to them by the mainstream media the police state is growing  both here and abroad as the citizens are promised reform the only thing that actually changes are the puppets in marble buildings matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world a classtwitterfollowbutton hrefhttpstwittercommattagorist datashowcountfalse datasizelargefollow mattagorist on twittera and now on a hrefhttpssteemitcom share google  real truth stings 
i think its time to end local policing for profit the police force should exist to protect and serve not to fill the county coffers we need direct oversight of the police the end of the power of their union to protect bad cops and the end of corrupt local government the downside is the federal government is so big and spread out that they can barely keep track of our military assets we can count on them to institute a public facing qualifications search for candidates randy pitts 
do you really not understand that what you just said is exactly what this article is exposing 
soros has indoctrinated you fools into favoring a federal police real truth stings 
do you have a better idea we have localized corruption in every state if you have another way to achieve this feel free to discuss it billdeserthills 
right mostly because obama has been doing everything he can to crap on the police by your thinking the tsa is doing a fantastic job huh real truth stings 
you arent looking at the upsides that are possible billdeserthills 
because there are no upsides except for upside yo head when those even stupider federalized cops hit you pto 
replace local corruption with centralized corruption at least now some places arent corrupt billdeserthills 
citizen oversight cole 
soris is not favoring a national police he wabts rules and restrictions put on the police before we devolve into a police state and we already half way there he is funding blm because they are at the forefront of bringing police misconduct to lightt how do you people not see this razedbywolvs 
i dont like police misconduct but i dont burn down the city yelling kill the jews to accomplish it tracy lund 
what a stupid thing to say razedbywolvs 
does that make you pro burring down the city to stop the  who all happen to be ashkenazi jews az patriot 
what are you talking about  what do jews have to do with this  you and some other people are on this are now blaming the jews for the mess we are in how stupid razedbywolvs 
well that kind of happens when you use a lobbys to buy off every politician in a foreign country and are a big contributing factor to what appears to be a  year old blood feud in the me httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkmvhbrqi az patriot 
typical jew hater there really is no hope for you or your soul  why not worry about the people who are willing to blow you up  razedbywolvs 
would being opposed to a special interest group of saudi buying off american politicians make me a arab hater thats stupid i dont hate jews but i really wounder how you all got brainwashed as bad as north koreans i really dont think israel has a problem blowing us up they sure as hell dont care about us enough to give a heads up when they know in advance that  americans are going to die httpsuploadsdisquscdncomimagesbbfbdfbeccfeddcccfbeadabbaebfbjpg httpsuploadsdisquscdncomimagesdaeccfbfdcaecbbddcdbbpng s az patriot 
so you are one of those  crazies who believe the jews knew about this and that the bushes did this to get oil i think you and that other loon rosie odonnell make a one team of nuts razedbywolvs 
are you one of those crazies that doesnt believe official fbi documents i figured you would of been trigged by the brainwashing comment but you skipped right over it and pointed at one the few non jews in hollywood as the problem you have to have a short list for that especially since rosie odonnell hasnt been relevant for  years if ever my tin foil hat is itching the immigrant absorption ministry i think your idf httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoyuoguvb az patriot 
this tape means nothing and you havent shown any shred of fbi evidence you are a crazy  loon razedbywolvs 
i guess the difference between loons and sane people is we read the dam reports you should try it az patriot 
you read into things that arent there go away loser razedbywolvs 
go away from were do you think im inside your computer or something billdeserthills 
sure cause soros is such an honorable guy huh why i bet you think he does this for the good of humanity just so he can get that real special place in heaven that he so richly deserves dont you prince 
local police should not existperiod steve yates 
who will protect us from the criminals prince 
the nd amendment jo 
prince the second amendment doesnt matter if there is no government and police to enforce it duh prince 
duh jo we the people enforce it with guns doodlee pigvirus 
check out  ideas for a copfree world carolyn 
i think you can make a list of crimes in one night that chicago will commit just for a starter carolyn 
mr prince when he gets robbed assaulted in anyway he wants to call razedbywolvs to help him because no one else will get real the constitution states that the states should govern themselves not let the government do it nishi 
i have never been so naive as to think that smart and engaged people refrained from brainstorming solutions together according to their shared beliefs nor have i ever thought that would be a good idea cole 
tell this so called journalist that he cant complain about soros trying to change the direction of our police force before it turns into a police state then at the end of the article try himself to tell us we need to be on the watchout for a police state shusei 
right there is no evil plan in these memos i dont know much about soros if he is evil guy or good guy but least i can say is this article is bs and many people in here have no ability to read understand and think prince 
somebody really needs to put a bullet in soros head despicable rem certified 
dont leave out his son greg geitner 
now its easy to see why soros was paying them to act out ricialove 
as a black woman heres what i want to knowwith all that money that blm receiveswhat the heck do they do anna miller 
george soros is a criminal subversive who has created havoc on a global level and for a long time his crimes are welldocumented he is the billonaire who broke the british pound in  he is responsible for funding numerous revolutions including the coup in ukraine toppling a democratically elected president and moving nato closer to russian borders and funding ngos who were not really charities but subversive infiltrators he is an evil man have you noticed how many billonaire jews are involved in all kinds of evil financial schemes and or hold such high positions in both neoliberal as well as neocon both sides of the fencegovernment positions although they only make up  of the populace why hasnt this criminal been arrested his aim is to deliberately stir up a race war the police are attacking people of all colors and ages yet blm seems to defend black men who were in truth guilty at least they could pick a black man or woman who was actually innocent why doesnt black lives matter defend blacks who have been murdered by other blacks which is usually the case or dont those black lives matter and how about the  of black children born to single mothers with no father in the home often to siblings from multiple fathers these children often grow up to be street thugs the facts bear this out blacks do commit most of the crime in the us and commit more crimes against whites as well the issue should be on the increasing police brutality on all citizens not only focused on black lives the police target them more because blacks commit most of the crime does the truth enter this equation blm detracts from the entire populace of all races focusing together on increased police brutality against the public at large for soros and those who want to increase antiwhite sentiment and race tensions blm is mission accomplished the bastard soros should have been arrested a long time ago and imprisoned and not in one of those cushy hotel prisons either and one can only wonder who is really running this nation when soros remains unfettered dan 
maybe just maybe hitler saw something that the rest of the world still can not see or simply refuses to see az patriot 
what are you saying all jews should have been sent to the gas chamber so that soros wouldnt be around  dan 
oh right your one of those kinds of people huh next you are going to tell me that they really did make lampshades and soap out of jews huh az patriot 
if i were you i wouldnt continue to show your ignorance insensitivity and anti jew sentiment go away dan 
im ignorant bwahahah heres an easy one for ya whats  minus   carolyn 
idiot must run in your family carolyn 
dan you are an atheist who wants the world to believe that hitler did not slaughter millions of jews go to the holocaust museums filled with the pictures and tools the nazis used to experiment on the children pictures taken by the american soldiers when they entered into the prisons so go into a hellnory site and w her with your crap dan 
so explain to me how they had to change the plaque at auschwitz in the s from claiming  million died there to only just over  million and its now believed that its not even  million that died there 
and you dare to call me the idiot keep googling im sure you can find it carolyn 
i did not call you an idiot but i should have auschwitz was only one of many concentration and death camps you check it out dan 
wow you have shown your level of stupid on  levels in the one post good work but i digress ad hominems like yours only exist to show your own lack of a reasonable argument 
auschwitz was well known to have been by far the largest concentration camp during ww with the greatest population compared to all other camps it even boasted a swimming pool inside the camp for its population how do they just lose  million deaths from that camp if auschwitz could not accomodate  million deaths but only closer to  million how did the other much smaller camps process more deaths than alschwitz 
now here is hte real kicker from back in  jews were already claiming the  million  decades into the future its in the damn newspapers and you can freely search and find them for yourself 
care to explain how that happened jew magic i guess httpsuploadsdisquscdncomimagesefadbaaaeddfeefdeedfffebacfbfjpg carolyn 
dan did you read any of the small incomplete articles evidently not m was quoted to show that russia and other countries had that many jews nothing about death these prior years to  were expressing the plight of how the jewish people were being treated now auschwitz was not the only camp that slaughtered jews now does that sign specifically say that auschwitz deaths were just auschwitz murders your damn newspapers need to be read by you before you put that smudge attitude in writing dan 
wow your brain really is broken huh you cant see the connection between claiming the magical  million prophecy which is actually about claiming the heartland in  and using that same exact figure in the lies about ww the same lies that the nazis also made lampshades and soap out of jews 
auschwitz plaque was obviously blatantly lying just like the lampshades and soap myths once the soviets were forced to give up the ledgers iirc in the s it was obvious that they could no longer sustain the lie that  million were killed there and were forced to bring that number down to about  million are you really that stupid that you can not see the pattern here 
there is a hell of a lot more but i get the feeling that im talking to someone to stupid to even grasp the basics 
fun fact anne frank never wrote anne franks diary otto bought the story from another novelist and changed it to reflect his daughter there was even a recent copyright case where they are now claiming that he was the author fun times carolyn 
oh i see your pattern believe that crap instead of what the pictures written accounts by the liberation armies and you did not answer my question on the articles you want to point to that does not say m jews died did you pull all of the articles and read the whole story i would bet you did not you are a typical atheist marxist democrat you can pound your chest again when you check history and find out that the democraps started the kkk group and were the biggest slave owners you people amaze me how you put crap out there that you can not back up kind of like your loving candidate hellnory dan 
show me a single picture of gassed jews or even of the gas chambers themselves or even the several thousand dead jews they would have to have piled up waiting for their several hours in the crematorium it actually took back then to cremate even a single body or you mean i am meant to take the word of the proven lying jews who to this day like in the video i linked above have clung to their fantasies even after they have been busted lying 
as for the liberating armies you do recall that all the gas chambers were in ruins when they came through and there was zero evidence besides the lamp shades and soap of any jew holocaust that account you mean 
and of course it dosnt say that  million died yet only that they were in peril etc but you dont find it a mighty large coincidence you also obviously have no idea how they came up with the  million at the end of ww do you go find out where that number came from the person who made it up even claimed it was completely symbolic and not to be taken literally 
you are a typical atheist marxist democrat and in the face of clear defeat out with the mindless ad hominem once again a clear indicator that you are way outside of your depth you are incorrect on all  counts once again do you ever get anything right 
were the biggest slave owners guess who the biggest slave owners were fucking jews hahaha they owned all the slave ships and were behind every facet of the trade 
kind of like your loving candidate hellnory and thats the funniest go find my twitter feed its full of anti hillary sentiment in fact its the only reason i really began using twitter was during this election cycle to keep track of whats going on because i refuse to engage in the corrupt leftist media once again mostly jew owned for fear of turning into a brainless zombie like yourself 
ill give you this tho you certainly are persistent in your stupidity its no wonder you cant see anything thats going on around you in this world dan 
here is a great classic you really should watch about his explaining away his lies as not really lies httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjswiomiak carolyn 
you really have a real talent referencing things dan 
yea this is how you learn things you take a fairytale lets use santa as an example and you work out when your like  years old how can there be  santas in the same place why are my presents always in the bottom of my parents wardrobe a week before santa apparently brings them to you a week later and slowly you deduce that there is no santa clause and its just a lie that you have been fed while your brain is all still mushy 
or you know you can just blindly have faith that there is still a santa you know like you do even in the face of such a mountain of evidence carolyn 
you need to stop your atheistic info because you do not know what you are talking about m jews killed in all of the auschwitz camps did you know that there were  large camps with  large crematoriums no you did not that is just a drop in the bucket places that murdered experimented on starved gased and shooting of jews k hungary k poland k france k netherlands k greece k boheman  moravia k slovakia k belgium k yugoslavia k itally  norway and k from other countries k jews k poles k gypsies k soviet prisoners k czecks yugoslavs french germans did you know that hitler had built  camps death camps concentration camps holding camps gas camp vans labor camps and detention camps many jews died in ghettos on trains during the death march to evade the oncoming of the russian army and us forces these camps were set up in france russia germany poland and austria one of the camps berkenau killed  thousand jews per day in total m jews killed in killing centers and  jews shot gased experimented on now how do you explain your decision to not believe these totals dan 
of course i knew i obviously know more about the subject than you do like you i came from a place of believing the lies until i started questioning some of the facts i was taught and the advent of the internet and survivors videos where they constantly get busted telling lies made me reconsider the truth about ww 
actually current scholars beleive its somewhere between k and i think its k it might be k died in all of auschwitz while i do not doubt that there was some experimenting america was doing the same thing but on its own people at the time the great majority were simply natural attrition in a time of war considering the allies were bombing supply lines constantly yet never the camps themselves because they also knew they were not death camps in fact lets invoke the story of the holocaust poster child again anne frank if they were really gassing people in some huge manner why would they even keep around a weak sickly girl long enough for her to die from typhus 
and yes of course many people died many of them jews thats what happens when you have wars none of this supports gassing or mass extermination of jews stupid 
but my final question is how do you blindly believe the word of people who have been shown on many occasions to be liars specially in the face of so much verifiable evidence to the contrary ie the lampshades soap diesel gassing vans eye witness stories that completely contradict everything etc specially knowing the fact that many jews chose to escape with their german captors rather than await the soviet armys rescue carolyn 
of course you did not know any of the information i wrote if you profess that you know how many died then go on the holocaust site and you will see that after they checked the records that the germans kept you do know they tattooed the jews to make sure what numbers were dead or alive how would i know why they kept anne franks till she died of typhus they very cruel people the jews were at war with the nazi germans what the hell are you talking about if you go on the site you will see pictures of the gas chambers and crematories what the hell else do you want why dont you go to auschwitz and see for yourself you are so bigoted and i believe you are a lousy democrap despicable rem certified

Hrafnkell Haraldsson,donald trump destroyed as fact checker reveals trump lies  to  times per day,"syria a man receives treatment at a hospital following a daesh chemical attack in the sheikh maqsood neighborhood of syrias aleppo april   photo by rt 
syria has dismissed as baseless recent allegations brought against the damascus government by western countries in connection with chemical attacks in the wartorn arab country 
the syrian arab republic has repeatedly denied all allegations circulated by some western circles and their agents about the use of chemical poisonous materials by syrian sides like chlorine gas during military operations against terrorists syrias foreign ministry said in a statement carried by the official sana news agency on wednesday 
the statement came four days after an international inquiry blamed syrian government forces for a toxic gas attack in qminas in northwestern idlib province on march   
the accusation was made in the fourth report from the monthlong probe by the united nations and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons 
however the syrian foreign ministry statement said that there was no tangible evidence for the inquirys findings 
syria has repeatedly warned against repercussions of politicizing this issue regarding the credibility of the work of international relevant sides the ministry added 
it also stressed that the syrian government remains committed to all its obligations under the chemical weapons convention a multilateral treaty that bans chemical weapons and requires their destruction 
daesh has frequently used chemical weapons in both in syria and iraq where the takfiri terrorist group is mainly active 
a report by the syrianamerican medical society published back in march said that daesh had carried out more than  attacks involving poisonous or asphyxiating agents such as sarin chlorine and mustard gas since the beginning of the conflict in syria the report added that over  people had been killed in the chemical attacks

Roosh Valizadeh,podcast what travel can and cant give a man,"the media doesnt even try to hide its shameless prosocialist bias these days since nobody really pays attention to them anymore you might have missed some of the more entertaining butthurt spouted by shameless propagandists posing as journalists
 election night coverage on the propaganda news channels is a lesson in hilarity when examining the reaction of lamestream media talking heads what is most entertaining about trumps ascendancy to the oval office is that it was totally unexpected catching cocksure marxists at cnn and other alphabet channels completely off guard
lets go over some of the more entertaining reactions last tuesday
 hillary shill martha raddatz breaks down in tears 
over at abc the wrinkled old hillary shill martha raddatz was at a loss for words as she attempted to perform an off the cuff hamster rationalization to fellow clinton operative george staphylococcus explaining why the bitch lost the election

raddatz looked like her mother just died as victory turned into defeat for the criminal hillary clinton shes sure to be moving from a pack of smokes a day to two packs a day as the reality of the election continues to settle into her pea brain over the next  years her tears say more than her boilerplate language ever could
 bernstein plays the race card 
to the mainstream media white people voting in accordance with their own selfinterest is racist in fact white people acting in any other manner than total subservience is racist to cnn washington post journalist carl bernstein even went so far as to say trumps election is tragic and dangerous as despondent and quite possibly drugged cnn propagandists looked on bernstein seemed most upset about trumps immigration policy proposals in which mexico will no longer be able to flagrantly let its citizens violate us immigration law
bernstein completely forgot the racism white people have endured all year long at the hands of black lives matter la raza and other black and brown supremacist groups
 chris matthews goes into hamster rationalization mode 
hamster rationalizations are usually reserved for women but effeminate lowt manlets like chris matthews also have them his first spin of the hamster wheel makes him say hillary won the debates she didnt then he says she had the best ad campaign nobody believes advertising or anything you say anymore chris then matthews says she had the best ground game she might have but she was a terrible candidate the halfman halfalligator james carville looked ready to give chris a hug as the reality of hillarys defeat began to settle in on msnbc
 the racist van jones whines about white people 
van jones looked like he needed a change of underwear as he fell back on tired old leftist talking points from the s about the evil white male especially white males that havent been turned into geldings he then goes on with an emotional overreaction to say families will be afraid to have breakfast the next day because whitey got back into office lmfao really dude
he then says immigrants are afraid now that trump is going to be president no van immigrants arent afraid illegal hordes who figuratively if not literally say fuck you to us immigration law are afraid as they should be
jones then goes on to make a supremely ironic quote as he talks about a socalled whitelash he says trumps campaign was based on throwing away some of us to appeal more deeply to others umm isnt that what the entire platform of the democratic party is van throwing away nay crucifying white men to appeal more deeply to others  your entire career is based on just that mr jones
 cbs does a mea culpa cbs published an article admitting how badly the press is biased
cbs was so stunned it did a full mea culpa on the networks shoddy coverage of the  election this stunning article entitled the unbearable smugness of the press needed to be written  years ago better late than never cbs actually echoed what we in the manosphere and altright have been saying since day one with the oped piece
this is all symptomatic of modern journalisms great moral and intellectual failing its unbearable smugness  had hillary clinton won thered be a winking we did it feeling in the press a sense that we were brave and called trump a liar and saved the republic
the eyeball network even admitted the contempt the network has for men like us
so much for that the audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate it turned out was rather limited this was particularly true when it came to voters the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it trump knew what he was doing when he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him they hate us and have for some time
and can you blame them journalists love mocking trump supporters we insult their appearances we dismiss them as racists and sexists we emote on twitter about how this or that comment or policy makes us feel one way or the other and yet we reject their feelings as invalid
damn at least some people over there know why we hate them that includes this former mainstream media news anchor who defected
shameless activism got marxism its the guiding philosophy of the alphabet channels
anyone who has the capacity to perform an iota of critical thinking knows the mainstream media is not on the side of the average american it hates and seethes at traditionalists and works to tear down every institution of western civilization while attempting to impale the most hated of creatures on this planet the evil white male
the rebuke of a sorry candidate like hillary when the socialist shills thought she was a shoein caught the smug son of a bitches off guard their reactions are priceless and need to be documented and remembered these reactions are undeniable proof that blogs like return of kings and web sites like breitbart and drudge are sorely needed indispensable resources in this day and age
we have not been getting the truth from media for generations and now as alternative voices appear the rift between the two versions of reality grows wider and deeper the once mainstream media have become nothing but shameless activists for new world order socialism the election night horror show only solidifies this point
we should be proud to be activists pushing our own agenda if nothing else to balance the scales the media are not friends of the american public ultimately the tired old socialist media must be dismantled in order for freedom and traditionalism to survive

tasscom 
russia and china need to create an autonomous financial system which would be minimally subject to political risks and external pressure russian prime minister dmitry medvedev said in an interview with the chinese central television cctv 
as i see it what should we be guided with in creating a modern financial system in the peoples republic of china and in the russian federation he said we need to set up a modern protected and simultaneously quite autonomous financial system which would be subject to political risks to a lesser degree nowadays russia and china are considering integration of russias national payment system the mir bank cards and chinas unionpay system he said 
in our view it would help to enhance the reliability of payments medvedev said adding that sometimes some countries were trying to exert all sorts of political pressure european banks had been regularly fined by us financial authorities and financial companies he added 
they say we will take ten billion euros from a french bank and seven billion euros from a german bank our european partners agree with this medvedev said 
i am not speaking about the nature of these disputes but that we must protect our financial systems china must protect its own system and russia must protect its own system therefore this cooperation is very useful as in this situation noone will be capable of blocking the road of financial traffic he emphasized russia looks to predictability of chinas economic growth 
russia expects that chinas economic growth will be predictable and is set to cooperate with chinese partners for the purpose russias prime minister said in an interview 
we are interested in predictability of chinas economy growth and so we are ready to work with our chinese partners medvedev said adding the russian government was implementing a plan aimed to boost the economic growth 
actually everyone needs it our country needs it as recently we have been plunged in a phase of such decline both european and us economies need it since they have not been gaining fast growth to say nothing about japan also the chinese economy needs it since it had been gathering speed in the past years but has slowed down later he said it is closely watched by everyone as chinas economy is the most significant factor of the world economic growth energy and high technology sectors 
russia and china may reach the goal of bln trade by  but energy and high technology sectors along with traditional trade should move up a gear russian prime minister said 
indicators have been improving this year as a result of joint work of the two states including our countries leaders governments ministries agencies and businesses medvedev said russia china intend to develop small satellite for wifi network 
i am convinced that if we move ahead like this by  we will be able to reach the trade of  billion worth however attention should be turned to key aspects of cooperation he said explaining he implied the energy sector with some projects like the power of siberia gas pipeline 
in  construction of an eastern stretch of the gas pipeline was launched he said also it includes oil supplies along the skovorodinomohe oil pipeline extension and construction of large facilities in particular the construction of unit  at the tianwan nuclear power plant 
besides hightech projects should be enhanced he said

thursday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags hospital visits  rising prices  healthcare costs naturalnews when word got out last year that a handful of hospitals throughout florida were massively pricegouging their patients experts predicted that the outrageous bills for services at these care facilities would quickly drop in response but the exact opposite occurred a new investigation has found with many of these same hospitals not only charging the same ridiculous prices but in some cases drastically more researchers from the university of miami looked at hospital prices both before and after the media picked up on the issue evaluating the billing schemes at some  of the priciest florida hospitals to see how they may have changed they looked at these hospitals total billing charges in the quarter of a year before news of the gouging first broke headlines as well as in the quarter postheadlinesin a fiveyear period spanning from  bayfront health dade city topped the list of floridas most expensive hospitals with price increases nearly doubling following were kendall regional medical center heart of florida regional medical center north okaloosa medical center and sebastian river medical centerall of these facilities and many others despite having their names tarnished for taking advantage of patients were found to still be charging the same or even higher prices in  the researchers learned other than a minor setback of temporarily decreased share prices these exploitative care facilities are continuing to get away with jacking their prices  and with no end in sightwe were thinking we would see a drop or lowering of some charges karoline mortensen coauthor of a study published in the journal of health care finance that looked at hospital prices both before and after the publicity told the washington post wp  theres nothing stopping them theyre not being held accountable to anyone the insurance system is utterly broken and uninsured patients are even worse off part of the problem is that hospitals in most states can legally charge whatever they want for medical services because they know that a bulk of their patients insurance companies will simply foot the bill insurance companies are responsible for negotiating rates which they typically do on behalf of patients so in the end prices decrease at least to some degreebut hospital costs are still prohibitively and unnecessarily expensive in many cases  especially for patients who dont have insurance and who thus have nobody to advocate on their behalf for fairer pricing schemes in the end hospitals are raking their uninsured patients over the coals while these patients have little at their disposal to fight this medical target_blankhttpwwwmedicalchoicenewsmedical tyrannyeven government programs like medicare and medicaid negotiate better pricing in order to decrease costs and yet hospitals are still overcharging them at an everaccelerating rate with the exception of maryland and west virginia states have no regulatory functions in place to prevent such pricegouging which is effectively ruining american healthcarethe other major factor is that among the httpwwwnaturalnewscomhospitalshtmlho included in the investigation only one operates as a nonprofit the rest are forprofit companies that apparently care more about making money than they do about caring for patients while charging a fair and appropriate rate for medical servicesas httpsciencenaturalnewscomhospitalshtm target_blankhospital charges continue to rise and the best path forward to address price transparency continues to elude policy makers and stakeholders it is important to recognize that hospitals may not respond quickly to public exposure and these initiatives the researchers concluded in their earlier study which likely reflects trends all across the countrythe primary causes of extremely high markups in httpwwwnaturalnewscomhospitalhtmlhos markets are lack of price transparency and negotiating power of uninsured patients outofnetwork patients and other disadvantaged payers sources for this article include wwwwashingtonpostcomnewstoyourhealthw target_blankwashingtonpostcom",legorafi.fr,Fake,english,16.684927674847486,47.88118811881188,36,6,4246,631,5.713153724247227,631.0,-0.7937039820034537,-0.7657300402589515,0.3352658696668468,0.2112517271033146,0.6158580238965151,0.2277881287384618,0.0015847860538827,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0023931480991974,0.8326,0.09,0.077,0.833,Positive,Very Strong
No Author,episode   sunday wire ticktock usa with guests dr marcus papadopoulos basil valentine,"st century wire says 
over the past months hillary clinton the obama white house and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that  russia is hacking the us election  blaming moscow for the wikileaks emails the dnc leaks and for allegedly hacking us voting systems despite the grand accusations no evidence or proof has been offered by the us government 
it goes without saying how damaging the democratic partys crazed witch hunt has been to usrussian relations where clinton has led the antirussian crusade and demonizing president vladimir putin at every opportunity 
todays stunning presidential victory by donald trump means that all eyes are now on putin to see how moscow and washington will be interfacing going forward 
with such sensitive geopolitical issues like syria and the ukraine currently in play what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward 
in a message to donald trump russian president vladimir putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between moscow and washington in keeping with each others views meets the interests of both russia and the us 
putin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing russianamerican relations out of their current crisis 
the russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some burning issues that are currently on the international agenda and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security ria novosti reported 
on top of it putin has expressed confidence that building a constructive dialogue between moscow and washington based on principles of equality mutual respect and each others positions meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community 
according to many observers usrussia relations are now at their lowest point since the cold war putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of russias relations with the us was not our choice however 
for things to improve between moscow and washington the us should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect russias interests rather than try to dictate terms putin said last month 
we are concerned with the deterioration of russianamerican relations but that was not our choice we never wanted that on the contrary we want to have friendly relations with the us a great country and a leading economy putin said at an economic forum in moscow

George Zapo,cranberry juice does not prevent urinary tract infection new study finds,"a ppp poll of florida found 
candidates who have been vocal in their support for gun violence prevention perform well in florida democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton leads republican donald trump by four points  and democratic us senate candidate patrick murphy is tied with republican incumbent sen marco rubio  by an almost two toone margin  florida voters would be more likely to vote for a candidate for us senate who supports strengthening gun laws suggesting ample room for growth for gun safety candidates before the election next month 
the poll was conducted by ppp the americans for responsible solutions pac and it illustrates the dilemma that the florida senate race has created for democrats democratic leadership is divided on spending more money on expensive florida media but there are polls that suggest that sen marco rubios democratic challenger rep patrick murphy has a chance of winning the seat 
if rep murphy can beat sen rubio the defeat would likely put an end to rubios national political career or at least force the florida republican to put the brakes on his plan to run for president in  and instead focus on a run for governor 
democrats have a real chance to send marco rubio to the unemployment line rubio has been a disinterested senator who just like ted cruz seems only interest in his senate seat as a platform from which to launch his presidential ambitions rubio has provided poor service to his constituents  and doesnt deserve to return to the us senate 
sen rubio has refused to commit to serving his full senate term which should tell voters all they need to know about his commitment to them 
democrats have a chance to solidify their potential senate majority by sending marco rubio home with cash to spend and less than two weeks left in the campaign theyd be foolish not to take it

Rmuse,the media ignores the good news on climate change,"by hrafnkell haraldsson    pm trump sat on the stage looking for all the world like an honored donor to the cause and then got up and left without leaving a donation   
not only is donald trump a liar and a thinskinned crybaby but he is selfish never spending his own money when he can spend somebody elses this behavior was never more in evidence than the washington post s david fahrentholds account of a  a ribboncutting held by the association to benefit children for a nursery school when donald trump showed up sat down to appear to be a great supporter and then left without leaving a donation 
as sopan deb tweeted  
 sopan deb sopandeb october   
frank and kathie lee gifford were big donors and it is no wonder gifford was so shocked by trumps presence what had been exposed is that trumps life is a sham a gigantic show put on by him in which he parades through life pretending to be something he is not 
as fahrenthold explains  
for as long as he has been rich and famous donald trump has also wanted people to believe he is generous he spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public  even nationally televised  promises to give his own money away it was in large part a facade a monthslong investigation by the washington post has not been able to verify many of trumps boasts about his philanthropy 
that philanthropist isnt the real trump the only person trump visibly cares about is donald trump he uses his foundation to buy himself nice things spending other peoples money for luxury items and collectibles when he does make donations it is again because he gives no money to his own foundation with other peoples money 
fahrenthold says that the only donation of trumps own money the paper could find from the period of  to today is a  gift to the police athletic league of new york city in

Gillian,angel messages for november   video,"by wmw_admin on october   sanchez manning  daily mail oct   
the bbc has been accused of acting recklessly after targeting children as young as six with a programme about a schoolboy who takes sexchange drugs 
parents are angry that the show available on the cbbc website features a transgender storyline inappropriate for their children 
and concerned campaigners said it could sow the seeds of confusion in young minds the programme just a girl depicts an yearolds struggle to get hormones that stunt puberty making it easier to have sexchange surgery in the future 
one mother writing on the mumsnet website said her daughter had become worried after seeing the video she said her girl who likes wearing boys clothes and playing football had asked me anxiously if that means she was a boy 
tory mp peter bone said it beggars belief that the bbc is making this programme freely available to children as young as six i entirely share the anger of parents who just want to let children be children 
it is completely inappropriate for such material to be on the cbbc website and i shall be writing to bbc bosses to demand they take it down as soon as possible 
former culture secretary maria miller voiced her concerns over the bbc tackling the subject in an ageappropriate way saying such issues should be raised where children can have support from parents 
and tory mp julian brazier said this programme is very disappointing and inappropriate children are very impressionable and this is going to confuse and worry them 
family campaigner norman wells said it is irresponsible of the bbc to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex 
just a girl is the fictional video diary of a child who calls herself amy and dresses as a girl it is hosted on the cbbc website aimed at children aged between six and  
in the halfhour programme amy  played by an actress  reveals she was born a boy called ben but has already started using pubertyhalting drugs 
such hypothalamic blockers provoked a furore two years ago when the mail on sunday revealed an nhs clinic was willing to give them to children as young as nine 
critics cited research claiming that most teenagers confused about their gender never go through with surgery with many realising they are gay the bbc row comes amid growing controversy over gender issues fuelled by a number of highprofile cases in one a christian couple were threatened with having their yearold daughter taken away because they oppose her plans to become a boy 
in another a sevenyearold boy was ordered to be removed from his mothers care as she was raising him as female causing him a great deal of emotional harm 
in just a girl amy says when i was born mum said dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football but mum knew i was different she realised early on that i was born in the wrong body 
she adds my mum supported me when i did a powerpoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that i wasnt going to come to school in boys clothes any more but girls clothes i wasnt ben i was amy 
later amy is shown telling a friend josh  a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl  that she is on hormone blockers saying it took ages to get them after loads of tests and talks at the clinic once they realised i was trans for real i got them she says in another entry amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called liam but confides liam thinks im just a girl but im not im trans and whats he going to say if he finds out stop being my friend why im still me arent i 
child psychotherapist dr dilys daws said the programme could confuse children she said that while it was natural for youngsters to wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex the bbc was irresponsible to feature the extreme step of gender change for sixyearolds because they were too young to grapple with such issues 
the programme generated hundreds of comments on mumsnet 
one mother who said her sevenyearold had watched the show asked am i being unreasonable to think this is an inappropriate topic for a young age group 
another replied dont think this is remotely suitable for a sevenyearold to start suggesting that children can be transgender when theyre far too young to actually have a gender is reckless and damaging a small boy who is told that he can become a girl may take this as meaning that sex changes are possible that sometime in the future hell wake up with a girls body 
another user added i dont think hormone therapy should be normalised any more than yearolds drinking or doing recreational drugs should be normalised 
other critics slammed the bbc mr wells director of the family education trust said the more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girls body and a girl can be born into a boys body and that drugs and surgery can put things right the more children will become utterly confused respecting and preserving a childs birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue 
but some parents on mumsnet were more positive one wrote i dont believe there is too young for stuff like this the earlier you teach your children that everyone is different and that nobody is normal the better 
dr polly carmichael a clinical psychologist specialising in transgender children said raising awareness of these issues is the best way to challenge stigma and discrimination associated with identity issues programmes like just a girl can contribute to a healthy and informed public discussion 
the bbc said just a girl is about a fictional transgender character trying to make sense of the world deal with bullying and work out how to keep her friends which are universal themes that many children relate to and which has had a positive response from our audience

Roosh Valizadeh,what donald trumps victory means for men,leave a reply aa michael  when you are attuned to the midthdimensional frequencies of light you relinquish the idea of being human as you have known it in the past it is a time of the emergence of your soul consciousness as you allow it to become the reigning influence within your life this means you begin to listen to the wisdom of your body elemental and the signals it sends as to what is appropriate for your physical and emotional wellbeing your dna and the cells of your body begin to integrate the higher frequencies of light and gradually you begin to vibrate and attune to the refined energy of the new age this period of the transformation process could be likened to a death of your old selfconsciousness which is really the process of removing the veils of illusion as you integrate each new level of your oversoulhigher self you absorb the wisdom and illumination of that facet of your vaster being you are in the process of shedding the multiple layers of density which you have absorbed within your auric field down through the many ages of earthly experience the saying the light shall set you free is a true statement for the light is dissolving the layers upon layers of negativity that you have carried for such a very long time you begin to function within an auric field of refined light of your own creation as you turn inward and learn to stay focused and centered within your sacred heart in the power of the now moment over time you as light transformers begin to draw forth and integrate the maximum amount of adamantine particles of creator light and you then consciously radiate forth the remainder out to humanity and to the world when you achieve a certain level of harmony within you open the physical body gateways or portals to the higher dimensions the ascension chakra or the medulla oblongata and the vagus nerve at the base of the skull and also the back portal of your sacred heart and your sacred mind these are major steps in the ascension process when this process is complete you are well on your way to gaining access to the first sublevel of the fifth dimension where your entrylevel sacred triad is waiting to welcome you the adameve kadmon body is your original individualized seed atom godself in a fully conscious light body form created by the elohim lords of lightbuilders of as the archetype of humanity the adam kadmon embodies the original complete divine and spiritual nature of manwoman it is not the same as your personal oversoul body of light which is itself evolving towards divine consciousness your higher selves your spiritualoversoul body and your sacred triads are refracted facets of your god self your original light body the kadmon light body has the ability to take on any form necessary to create and experience all forms of creation in your fathermother gods plan for this universe the adameve kadmon is a spiritualphysical creation which incarnates in the planetary worlds during all cycles of divine creation physical body  in the beginning awakening process there is a desire to turn inward and to listen to the inner wisdom of the soul this soul awareness includes your body elemental the memory seed atom which contains the perfect blueprint for your original adameve kadmon light form emotional body  first you become aware that your emotions control you through your wants needs and desires which in the long run do not bring you a sense of happiness or satisfaction you begin to turn inward and to question your life choices asking awhat have been the results of your actions you begin to seek answers for the pain and dissatisfaction in your life the voice of your superconscious mind becomes stronger as you gradually take heed and follow your souls guidance as you become comfortable and begin to rely on this voice of higher wisdom the egodesire body gradually relinquishes control and the soulself becomes the director and guiding influence in your life you begin to align your will with the will of your higher self for you have gradually learned to trust the inspirational and intuitive thoughts from your sacred mind eventually you begin to view all interactive events in your life from a higher vantage point you develop emotional detachment through a more refined view of human interactions having experienced most of the important tests of the emotions you develop a better understanding of the human emotional nature again you learn to go with the flow and you view your tests and challenges as gifts and opportunities for growth you have learned to make peace with the past and to script your future as you endeavor to live and focus on the now moment gradually over time the vibrational patterns of the emotional body are lifted above the magnetic pull of the physical realm the mental body  you begin to realize the limitations of your subconscious and conscious minds and you see how rigid limited and stuck you have been in the mass consciousness belief structure you willingly begin a selfanalysis process whereby you reevaluate your attitudes judgment and programmed concepts you begin to feel a burning desire to expand your knowledge beyond your physical reality as you seek to learn why you are here on earth and the greater meaning of life your instinctive mind gives way to your higher intellectual mind and gradually you gain access to your sacredintuitive mind as your soulself becomes the director of your destiny your life begins to change dramatically for the better then faith and trust become an inborn certainty that all is happening in divine order you also know with certainty that you are on an upward spiraling path to a more refined harmonious and loving reality all you have to do is stay in the moment and take one step at a time as the way is opened before you a selfmaster is selfdetermined  selfconditioned  selfaware  soulconscious a selfmaster is responsive to the surrounding environment while being the observer of mundane life experiences from a higher vantage point being in the world but not of it a most profound event is when you first experience the abounding loving energy and joy radiating forth from within your sacred heart and soul the souls nature is love and while residing within the limitations of the rdthdimensional environment it is through the soul self that you connect with the love essence of your motherfather god a selfmaster stands firmly centered within the sacred heart within the midst of chaos and change holding fast to

path of light and whose point of focus is from within the sacred mind and the sacred heart heshe has balanced harmonized and integrated all the facets of the soul self from within the rdthdimensional planes of consciousness heshe is now directly connected to hisher overlighting sacred triad which resides at least within the entry level of the th dimension in order to reach this stage an aspirant must have completed the first four stages of enlightenment and have attained selfmastery of the first four dimensions this is the level of ascension open to humanity at this time and it can and will be accomplished by many brave souls while in the physical vessel a disciple a disciple is a person who has heeded the whisperings of the soul self and who is actively seeking enlightenment wisdom

Troy Francis,habits all successful seducers share,"one of the foundations of living a good life in todays times is having a good place to call home whether you want a solid comfortable place with which to pursue your hobbies recover from the days tribulations and just to be or whether you want a bachelor pad for your romantic pursuits or both a good home is essential to the modern man
i purchased a home and i decided to be my own general contractor for the renovations my home was an asoriginallyfurnished home of the s and i brought its multicolor painted green shag carpeted datedness up to a sharply trimmed hardwoodfloored modernity while being of a somewhat timeless style a general contractor is a person hired by the architect or engineer to run the job site source the labor follow the schedule get the materials and execute the vision of the plan here are ten things i learned as my own general contractor
 there are good contractors and there are bad contractors 
you will run into both good and bad contractors out there a good contractor does good work at good value follows the schedule and is honest and doesnt lie to you a bad contractor will do any or all of the above i fired a contractor who had good value but did poor work could not follow the schedule and lied to me i paid more for a later contractor who did excellent work hit the schedule on time and was a perfectionist give a bad contractor a second chance mainly to see how he corrects it and if he fails to shape up cut him loose
a good contractor has the correct amount of paperwork but no more some firms i turned down did things by hand and had no contractors license and that is too little whereas a firm that gives you fifteen pages of legalese allowing them to take out an uncontested mechanics lien on your home if you do not pay is too much
a lot has to do with the presentation of the representative tradesmen are naturally rough people who work with their hands but a man that does not have a good handshake good eye contact and is evasive on important details is shady
 good contractors cost more and they are busy the best indicator of a good contractor is that they have a busy schedule and i mean they are booked often a month or so in advance the guy i fired kept trying to work me in on the weekends and at night which while it seems like hes busy hes actually operating in the red and trying to use your funds to cover his other jobs
a good contractor will negotiate terms up front and not change them and he will when awarded the job put you in his schedule at an agreedupon time my best contractor was so busy that i had to do other things first before i could get his firm to bid my work and they did what good contractors do when they are too busy they turned down my work until later
 you need to establish a reputation 
general contractors in an area have a reputation amongst their customers and the contractors they subcontract to and the only difference between those that do it for a living and you is that you have no reputation
a busy contractor will work with a gc who will give them work in the future over one who will not i was an unknown so the busy guys during the busy season fall and preholidays would pass on me and work with ones they knew
however word got around to the others that i gave jobs of good scope and paid on time i hired a sub contractor for a set of jobs and once they found out who i used as my electrician it was who they subbed their own electrical jobs to they called and the electricians vouched that i was picky as all hell but paid on time and let them run their own schedule and have the run of the house at that point i was in
 good contractors know other good contractors 
reputation works the other way too a good roofer who i only turned down because he was too busy and wouldnt meet my timetable has a brother who runs the electrical shop mentioned above although you should always get multiple competing quotes bid to three two will generally respond and pick the better one the deciding factor was that his brother the roofer ran a good shop and it stood to reason he would too
my plumbers knew my ac guys and my chimney guy my flooring guys knew my kitchen cabinets guys everyone works with and around everyone else and i saved all my paperwork and contact info for all my vendors so that on any future projects i know who to call for what and even if i dont know i know who to ask for recommendations
 it will take more money than you think it will 
home renovation is expensive and its mainly for the nasty reason that once you commit to action you can get hit with extra costs you can mitigate this with good bid scopes that you give to your contractors so all parties know what is what but you will find that the home will need things you didnt think about or that the hourly rate of the laborers is higher than you budgeted or materials will simply cost more
part of the balancing act that is required is you will learn what to spend money on now and what to spend money on later right now i live in the place finally but i still have construction paper down on my floors as i have not yet bought furniture pads or rugs for the high traffic areas my bathrooms have plumbing in but no mirrors cabinets towel racks or toilet paper holders entire rooms are without furniture all of these can and should be taken care of later but things like flooring and painting needed to happen earlier
 it will take more time than you think it will you may not need something this complicated but a gantt chart shows dependency of one job on others
contractors have their own schedules and there is also the time outside the work time where they have to arrange a site visit you have to juggle quotes they have to then write you in then they do the work then theres followups and punchlists and then finally that job is done and you pay them
you cant do some other jobs before you finish the first one this is where having a master schedule and knowing who is doing what and affecting whom matters my floor guys had to have the run of the place when they were finishing the floors but they did not when they were laying subfloor and i was able to have plumbers in that day as well contrariwise i could not start the kitchen install until after the floors were done
 some of your ideas are wrong some are right i had my own thoughts about what to do with the place sometimes i was wrong it was stupid to try to reuse the baseboard that was over the carpet and put it over the hardwood even though it was the same color and i listened to my contractor and used new sometimes i was right my backsplash behind my sink was supposed to match the countertops colors and the ratio of white i wanted was correct but i was persuaded to add more by my contractor
know what is important in your vision and be able to explain your intent but the contractor might have a better way of how to do it in mind than if you had told them the how instead of the what i have a rather creative way of running the drains on my basement fixtures they did what i wanted but did it in a better way than i would have suggested and they got it almost completely right to my intent in the process
 there will be gaps in your manpower coverage 
the one thing a professional general contractor does that you as a private operator will not is do all the basic stuff themselves a gc will hire an electrician to wire fan boxes for mounting fans but he will install the boxes and hang the fans himself my electricians did install and hang them for me anyway
this was for two reasons and this is how you can mitigate having little shit jobs that no one will want to do as a single job the first is to provide all the materials yourself which also allows you to pick out what you want i had a pile of fixtures fans and bulbs laid out for them with a plan of what went where and this helped them just throw them up after the technical wiring part was done
the second reason is to provide a good scope of work will a plumber come install a single faucet maybe will he come install five and a garbage disposal certainly thats a good days work so if you have little jobs have a lot of little jobs and youll get more interest
 there are things with which you will not be satisfied good enough is good enough 
this house is old but renovated some things simply cannot be fixed without massive upheaval i cannot have perfectly flat ceilings because the drywall is  years old and it had popcorn texture on it some things i did not address i have new baseboard and new window trim but the door trim is original and has the nicks and stains of time
some things were done but were not perfect the drywall where my kitchen cabinets bulkhead used to hang from the ceiling has one spot where even after two reworks still has a hairline paint crack some of the window film has pull away lines and theres a couple things trapped under the film in places one of the toilets will top itself off for a few seconds signifying a small seal issue you cannot have perfection but you can go for reasonable excellence
 code enforcement sucks the man sucks someone called code enforcement on me and i had to go get a permit of a cost of x of the renovations cost mainly so they can jack my taxes up
i got the permit and i expect my taxes to go up the inspector was a real schmuck as most appointed officials are but the jokes on him as i only got the permit on what i had left to do and i omitted some things that would still happen but werent too noticeable
with code enforcement and county ordinances the idea is reasonable cooperation and being able to explain things away with saying you were mistaken instead of flouting the law i went and got the permit when i was busted for it but they only know a third of the story had i gotten a permit earlier perhaps whatever nosy neighbor that ratted me out might not have called at all another tactic which i will do on a future project i have planned is to get the permit months ahead of time then hit it hard over a few days and be done before anyone notices
conclusion if you have the time the patience and the skill to know exactly what you want who to get for it and how to juggle a massive schedule running your own home renovation is a lot of fun and very educational if you want it done faster and just want to deal with one person for everything then hiring a professional general contractor might be the way to go instead

Max Roscoe,how influential french author alain soral become red pilled,"the celebrations have ended and weve all come to absorb the fact that donald trump is our next president an outcome that many of us have aggressively worked for in the past several months now that weve gotten what we wanted its time to describe exactly how a trump presidency will improve our standing
if the president can say it then you can say it 
the biggest effect well see is the death of political correctness we now have a shitlord for president who has insulted ugly women as fat pigs and whose private macho talk which all masculine men have done was relentlessly attacked by the press but not punished in the voter booth this means that when you talk like trump the first thought your listener will have is he sounds like the president of the united states
what excuse will they now have for limiting your speech if one man was able to gain the highest office in the land because of it either trump was elected because voters liked a person who makes those kinds of statements or they didnt care enough that he made them whichever explanation you accept means that the will of the american people has stated that you can exercise your free speech your opinions and your desire to flirt with attractive women without having to obey a speech police force that evaluates everything you do based on how offensive it is to a kaleidoscope of races and loony identities you can begin removing your politically correct filter
im in a state of exuberance that we now have a president who rates women on a  scale in the same way that we do and evaluates women by their appearance and feminine attitude we may have to institute a new feature called would trump bang to signify the importance of feminine beauty ideals that cultivate effort and class above sloth and vulgarity simply look at his wife and the beautiful women he has surrounded himself with to remind yourself of what men everywhere prefer and not the beauty at every size sewage that has been pushed down our throats by gender studies professors and corporations trying to market their product to feminist fatsoes  the president of the united states does not see the value in fat women who dont take care of themselves and neither should you
liberals will be forced to tolerate us in a way they didnt have to before 
there are so many of us that we can ease out of the closet and not be afraid of persecution like before what are they going to do fire everyone who supports trump accuse every man who voted for him of rape the way the establishment has been able to marginalize us is to corner men individually and apply intense pressure but now we have natural allies in all men who back trump even if they dont subscribe to our particular interpretation of masculinity 
liberals will not be able to point and shriek to get you to withdraw like before they will not have easy victories by using labels like racist or sexist they will have to endure us in their midst and bite their lip when we offend their degenerate ideals knowing that the price of attacking us is becoming too costly it may be as simple as whipping out your maga hat as if its a bat signal and having fellow trump supporters come to your aid i know that if i see a trump supporter in trouble i will help him regardless of his race or station liberals will be forced to share space with those whom they hate instead of trying to exile them like in the past
it will be easier to find a fellow traveler 
men who hold our beliefs have long ago learned that we cant go around sharing them in public to those who are not vetted if youre like me you first test a new man you meet with a masculine comment to see how he responds such as remarking on the attractiveness of a woman or how youve heard of a community online that trolls liberals without mercy weve even had to devise a special pet shop code to know if a man is aware of the teachings that are found on rok or the forum  we now have a easier shortcut in trump
if a man tells you that he voted for trump its safe to say that he is favorable to strong borders nationalism  masculinity and beautiful women on a basic level you will be able to get along with this man and build a bond it also works the other way around where you bring up trump to screen out those who are offended by him its fine if someone is politically indifferent but if a man opposes trump then i have to anticipate him attacking or sabotaging me in the future i will distance myself from him for my own wellbeing
the cultural decline will halt 
we now have a president who will not encourage antimale propaganda rape culture and female victimhood while i do have minor concerns on the influence of his feministminded daughter ivanka trump will not continue the attack on men that has been institutionalized since the sexual revolution and accelerated during the eight years of obama because our current cultural dystopia is the result of intense longterm manipulation it is more than enough for trump to simply not touch the gender issue to allow the culture to return to a more patriarchal order stop feeding the rot and it will die off allowing biology to naturally reassert itself
weve experienced so many changes in the past decade that we havent had a chance to understand whats going on and adapt instead weve been reacting from one blow to the next whether its the loss of our jobs through witch hunts or the rape culture horror that has turned a banal consensual hookup into possible incarceration trumps victory gives us room to begin pushing back against the fictions that have put men in harms way
conclusion paradoxically the benefits of a trump presidency will not involve specific actions from trump his presence automatically legitimizes masculine behaviors that were previously labeled sexist and misogynist while we may still get heat for them it will be less severe and well be less likely to sustain serious damage liberals will have no choice but to silently stew on our words and we can more effortlessly connect with men not only for male bonding but also to push back against a demoralized and fractured left victories will be far easier to achieve under trump than obama
this is our moment the door is opening for a renaissance of masculinity where men can take pride in being men and the best part of it is that we dont need to wait for trump to do anything his victory is more than enough for us to apply our own individual strength in seizing the bulls horns where we can come out of the politically incorrect closet and assert our beliefs and behaviors it would be icing on the cake if trump rolled back antimasculine laws and policies but its not required because the power to change ourselves and our country is within our hands return of kings opened in  and the only surprise for me is how quickly the name is being fulfilled

Daniel Greenfield,david frum hillary is a patriot who will protect the constitution,"european media jihad against geert wilders as they lose their grip the political and media elites are getting desperate november   robert spencer 
the mainstream media in western europe and north america isnt even pretending to be an objective news source anymore instead journalists are working openly to quell what looks increasingly on both sides of the atlantic like a popular revolution against the hegemony of the selfappointed political and media aristocracy that seems hellbent on driving western civilization over the cliff and so its time for another round of their twominutes hate against dutch politician and freedom fighter geert wilders 
wilders has yet again gone on trial in the netherlands for hate speech and this time the case against him is especially flimsy as europe is roiled by the criminal activity of muslim migrants he is being accused of hate speech for saying that the massive influx of immigrants from morocco from which most of the muslim migrants in the netherlands come has to be stopped 
this trial could very easily backfire on the dutch inquisitors and make wilders more popular than ever with the people of the netherlands and europe in general as they are increasingly fed up with the political and media elites forcing them to accept a massive influx of muslim migrants that ensures a future only of civil strife bloodshed and sharia oppression 
consequently those elites are trying desperately to shore up their position wilders chanted no more moroccans at a rally the horror to any sane person this means stop the influx of moroccan immigrants who only inflate crime rates and welfare rolls to the media which at this point is quite insane insofar as insanity means an inability or refusal to accept reality this means genocide 
and so in this deutsche welle dw piece by freelance journalist teri schultz were told that european parliament lawmaker cecile kyenge who was born in congo had numerous racial slurs  not to mention bananas literally  thrown at her along with suggestions she go back to her country does this have anything to do with the crime and civil strife that are the foundations for wilders position of course not but wilders schultz tells us is of course farright that allpurpose and meaningless semaphore that serves only to signal to rightthinking deutsche welle readers that wilders is as far as the media elites are concerned unsavory and must be opposed and shunned his positions left unexamined 
schultz contacted me to serve as the villain of her piece being sure to tell her hapless readers that i am known for extreme antiislam views to make sure that if any of them are foolish enough to find themselves agreeing with me they will immediately reverse themselves and get their minds right the term extreme also since the western governing class unanimously refers to jihad terrorists as extremists also implies that i am a terrorist 
after the article came out i challenged schultz on this she replied i dont think even you would consider your views mainstream do you i responded absolutely yes my views were the broad mainstream in the western world from  ad until the s what changed not islamic teaching to that she said okay youd have to argue it with another expert which i am not but thanks again for contributing indeed she is just a mouthpiece for the views the political and media elites want us to hold 
in any case schultzs article merely reveals the desperation of the ruling class and the selfappointed opinionshapers they can call those of us who wish to defend the people and culture of europe and north america farright and extreme every day and they do but the public can see with their eyes what is happening wilders popularity isnt growing because he is a charming fellow which is of course not to say that he isnt its growing because he speaks the truths that the political and media elites are in a frenzy to obscure 
and its only going to get worse for them the brexit vote and the trump candidacy whether he wins or loses shows that their hegemony is beginning to be challenged those challenges will continue and grow they will before too long be decisively voted out and repudiated",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,65,11,4174,712,4.844101123595506,712.0,0.0929721589459437,0.1737735362073249,0.3162167094615283,0.3382338710984824,-0.2418116643916655,0.3577390654486023,0.0028089887640449,0.0,0.0014044943820224,0,0,0.0,0.0046079199761344,-0.9851,0.071,0.117,0.811,Negative,Very Strong

Seapost,no title,the best mix of hardhitting real news  cuttingedge alternative news on the web all original stories all the time share this november   readers enraged by msm election reporting  you misled your readers blinded by journalistic bigotry  boycott all mainstream media and their lies in their efforts to initiate the overthrow of our republic and their continuing provocations in stirring up civil strife  let the new battle cry for truth be turn them off and tune them out by susan duclos  all news pipeline progressive liberals george soros and his merry band of paid protesters and the mainstream media are certainly giving new meaning to william shakespeares  fight to the last gasp  quote but what none of them seem to realize yet as they cry scream riot and offer their mea culpas is that the fight is over the election is finished their opponents have gone home to celebrate and they are doing nothing but flailing in the wind while grunting incoherentlywhile anyone can see the headlines about the third day of protests and riots and how those that are incapable of understanding quite how elections work and are holding out for a pipedream that maybe they can make electors of the electoral college change their vote what many are missing is how the mainstream media is attempting to suck more air out oxygen tanks that have gone empty and they have no one to blame but themselves the ultimate losers in the  election  the msm for the last year and a half we have witnessed and reported on the mainstream medias unrelenting and unapologetic campaign against donald trump where  percent of the reporting since the partys convention where he was named the gop nominee has been studied and found to have been negative but even before that they treated trump as if he didnt stand a chance to win that nominationwe have noted and reported via wikileaks releases how that very same msm had colluded with the dnc and the clinton campaign in order to influence the public to elect hillary clintonwe have also observed and reported how trump supporters were constantly labeled and portrayed as racist sexist xenophobic islamophobic uneducated uninformed white nationalist deplorables just to name a few of the colorful descriptorshow did that work out for themdespite their biased reporting and throwing everything including the kitchen sink at trump we now have presidentelect donald trump headed for the white house to be sworn in on january   while hillary clinton will fade into obscurity and the protesters will eventually go home just to criticize everything trump does for the next four maybe  years and progressives will get over their sworn revolution within the party between liberals and moderate democrats the ultimate losers are not clinton supporters celebrities that swore to leave the country if trump won nor democrats as a party it is the mainstream media that was rendered irrelevant crushed by a wave of deplorables and alternative media bypassing their onceinfluential status to communicate without their fasle prism of truth msms last gasp now they are offering their mea culpas dedicating countless hours and ink to explaining and justifying how they were so wrong in their predictions that they knew ahead of time were based on a false premise and taking their last gasp by swearing to rededicate themselves to reporting honestly while at the same time claiming they reported on both candidates fairlyi kid you notbelow is a letter by arthur o sulzberger jr and dean baquet the publisher and editor of the new york timesfirst point is that if they had been reporting fairly as claimed in the letter above they would not need to rededicate themselves to honesty secondly they did not strive to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences of trump supporters rather they maligned criticized belittled and mocked anybody that did not agree with their superior and smug political opinionwhile it is to be expected that trump supporters verbally abused on a regular basis will not forget nor forgive media outlets such as the times the public editor liz spayd who works independently with the job of examining the times with an eye to protecting journalistic integrity and good practices describes the reaction from other members of the public to their reporting readers are sending letters of complaint at a rapid rate heres one that summed up the feelings succinctly from kathleen casey of houston now that the world has been upended and you are all to a person in a state of surprise and shock you may want to consider whether you should change your focus from telling the reader what and how to think and instead devote yourselves to finding out what the reader and nonreaders actually think another letter from nick crawford of plymouth mich made a similar point perhaps the election result would not be such a surprise if your reporting had acknowledged what ordinary americans care about rather than pushing the limited agenda of your editors he wrote please come down from your new york city skyscraper and join the rest of us what ms spayd does not acknowledge is that their reporting will not and cannot change as long as their publisher and editor the ones that wrote the letter in the image above continue to insist their reporting during the campaign season was in any way fair or to even pretend they attempted to understand and reflect all political perspectives what ms spayd also does not address is the fact that five different new york times reporters accepted the invitations for the offtherecord gatherings to frame the hrc message with the clinton campaign staff before her campaign launched including gail collins jonathan martin maggie haberman patrick healy and amy chozick all of which consistently penned hit pieces against trumpit is heartening to see that outlets like the new york times are being called to the carpet by their own readers as well as admitting they are losing subscribers because while trump supporters were maligned and lied about their readers were misinformed and lied to  the countrys major news organizations as surprised as anybody by donald j trumps ascension to the presidency faced a question from their audiences on wednesday that was laced with a sense of betrayal and anger how did you get it so wrong the question came in letters to editors and writers of the nyt one reader wrote you were so wrong for so long you misled your readers and were blinded by your own journalistic bigotry it came in facebook posts you were in a bubble and werent paying attention to your fellow americans the filmmaker michael moore wrote in a post shared more than  times most ominously it came in the form of canceled subscriptions something that will surely be monitored former times reporter michael goodwin offers the times some free advice  using an outside law firm or even inhouse reporters he must assess how and why baquet made the decision to sever the paper from its roots he must assess the impact on reporters and editors and whether they felt pressure to conform their stories to baquets political bias whatever the findings the publisher must insist that the standards of fairness again become a fundamental tenet in the news room as an added guarantee he must insist that the paper enlarge its thinking about diversity to include journalists who disagree with the times embedded liberal slant there has to be a difference of perspective to judge where fairness lies readers and former readers should be part of the process many already know that the paper must get its head out of parochial new york and into the hearts and minds of americans everywhere this is about survival if it doesnt change now the gray ladys days surely are numbered bottom line frankly i believe traditional medias days are numbered whatever they do and they are on their last gasp there are too many independent journalists and alternative news sites from both sides of the political aisle that are rendering them irrelevant while alternative media has its own set of biases the majority always provide links documents when available video clips and other methods for readers to verify research and come to their own conclusions something mainstream media doesnt want readers to do because they feel they have the right to

Daniel Greenfield,jewish pirates of the caribbean,"search election law violation was hillarys idea orders to use donald duck to foment violence at trump rallies came straight from the top october   matthew vadum 
democrat hillary clinton personally authorized illegal dirty tricks operations against republican donald trumps campaign according to top democrats appearing in undercover video 
in the third hillaryrelated video released by acorn slayer james okeefe and his project veritas action fund this past sunday oct  clinton is directly implicated in a scheme to use donald duck to mock trump and troll his supporters at trump campaign rallies 
among disney cartoon characters donald duck was a natural choice after all his name used to appear regularly on voter registration documents when bill and hillary clintons favorite community organizing group the nowdefunct acorn hired hobos and felons to go on voterregistration drives 
earlier this year democrats in donald duck costumes started appearing at trump events across america costumed individuals would walk around carrying signs one said trump ducks releasing his tax return 
this cutesy publicity stunt isnt necessarily the problem though the problem is that hillary clinton ordered it and apparently broke the law by coordinating with a taxexempt nonprofit group 
prominent in the video is political organizer robert creamer who is very high up in the democratic partys hierarchy he has reportedly visited the obama white house  times including  meetings with obama personally 
one of the visits took place in obamas personal living quarters 
its a very big deal that creamer visited the presidents residence in the white house a former senior white house employee told frontpage in an interview white house employees can work there for years and never visit the residence 
creamer a practitioner of the agitation arts taught by marxist community organizing guru saul alinsky is husband tof rep jan schakowsky dill a socialist and advocate of singlepayer health care creamer is considered by many to be the legislative architect of obamacare he also wrote a series of bad checks to cover his salary at a nonprofit and went to prison prosecutors wanted to send him up the river for  months but he got off with merely five months and  months of home confinement from a friendly democrat judge 
creamer is a founder of the unsavory political consulting firm democracy partners  the list of partners on the companys website is a whos who of elite democratic party power players 
in addition to creamer the partners are 
midwest academy founder heather booth  website developer marc cerabona  organizer wyatt closs  seiu veteran mac dalessandro  maccabee group founder brett c di resta  crosscurrents foundation cofounder ken grossinger  former media matters for america online organizer david grossman  former seiu national field director for politics john hennelly  strategic communications advisor marilyn katz  organizer jackie kendall  strategist lupe lopez  political consultant mike lux  strategic advisor josie mooney  consultant patrick pannett  organizer christine pelosi her mother is house minority leader nancy pelosi usaction president khalid pitts  former dnc general counsel joe sandler  consultant linda saucedo  fundraiser renee schaeffer  former new organizing institute senior fellow joel silberman  and organizer cheri whiteman  
listed as associates are lauren windsor  executive director of american family voices and aaron black  who appears in the undercover videos black describes himself in the footage as basically deputy rapid response director for the dnc on the ground at trump events adding nobodys supposed to know about me 
frontpage published an article yesterday examining democracy partners 
for a master practitioner of fascistic tactics creamer is amazingly lacking in selfawareness or just plain dishonest he wrote a fatuous ahistorical oped in the huffington post earlier this year titled can fascism triumph in america 
like other fascist movements trump says out loud  and legitimates  the kind of hateful violent language that was previously whispered only in the privacy of peoples living rooms 
bear in mind that quite apart from his mischaracterization of trumps public statements creamer is shown in the videos masterminding an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents 
fomenting and carrying out acts of violence against political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteiling or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers ditto for mussolinis squadristi black shirts maos red guards irans basij  and haitis tonton macoute  
creamer explains the donald duck action in the third video 
in the end it was the candidate hillary clinton the future president of the united states who wanted ducks on the ground creamer says in one of several exchanges so by god we would get ducks on the ground 
creamer makes it clear he knows that this coordination between his consulting firm democracy partners and the campaign was a huge legal landmine when he said dont repeat that to anybody 
the whole duck thing that came about the reason we moved it from dnc to americans united for change was to just do a hopscotch but the actual idea was hatched way back in may creamer associate scott foval said making a pun 
the duck has to be an americans united for change entity creamer said this had to do only with some problem between now acting dnc chief donna brazile and abc which is owned by disney because they were worried about a trademark issue thats why its really silly 
we originally launched this duck because hillary clinton wants the duck in any case so she really wanted this duck figure out there doing stuff so that was fine so we put all these ducks out there and got a lot of coverage and trump taxes and then abcdisney went crazy because they thought our original slogan was donald ducks his taxes releasing his tax returns 
creamer is shown in the video hoping disney would file a lawsuit against democrats for using donald duck in the campaign likely because such a thing would generate publicity 
let them sue us please god he says looking to the heavens and clasping his hands together as if in prayer i doubt they will because were paying to rent or buy the suits thats where they get their license fees were not using it for commercial purposes 
the wall street journal reported aug  that donald ducks was the creation of the democratic national committee then on sept  the paper reported the dnc is no longer associated with the duck  americans united for change is now managing the duck  
but out of public view the dnc and the clinton campaign were still controlling the duck operation breaking federal campaign coordination laws okeefe says in narrating the third video 
we kind of divvy up responsibilities so sometimes it will be like campaign owned said jenna price assistant press secretary at the dnc so sometimes you will see that they advised something or they are taking credit for things so like we arent taking credit for the duck anymore thats like random ally groups but its still something that were involved in 
brad woodhouse president of americans united for change expected the presence of the duck at events would spark violence i think this duck is going to get roughed up somewhere 
in one segment foval says i almost got punched on monday morning i mean i was in a duck costume 
the nations campaign coordination laws were enacted after president richard nixons watergate scandal okeefe notes 
for an activity to violate the law it must meet a threepart test he explains 
first there must be payment by someone other than the candidate for electionrelated activity second a campaign has to be materially involved in shaping communications for a third party group and third electoral advocacy has to take place close to an election 
okeefe continues 
the payment prong of the test is complicated but just the fact that foval a paid employee of americans united for change was the duck at some events constitutes payment by aufc conduct based on their own admission the campaign creamer their agent and aufc coordinated the duck activities and finally content donald ducks is undeniably political content directed against one candidate for the sole purpose of helping another 
the fourth video released yesterday isnt so much an expose of wrongdoing but it does provide ample evidence of creamers ties to the clinton campaign and to president obama himself 
in a phone call creamer says i spend most of my time overseeing the trump events around the country i mean thats what i do for the clinton campaign uh so thats interesting as well 
in another scene when an undercover reporter phones saying he needs an immigration lawyer with powerful connections for a wealthy client in syria creamer makes it clear he is happy to help by reaching out to obamas inner circle 
i just need to i will try and find a couple of good referrals to you and get back to you pretty quick then okay  on the first well ill just talk the guy im going to talk to first to see if this is up his alley the first thing is up his alley its the guy who ran the campaign for president obama he has a firm thats pretty well connected 
in another setting creamer says 
heres what i do for the clinton campaign by the way im a consultant to the clinton campaign wherever trump or pence go in the country we make sure that there are press events in the tv market or whatever  whether theyre big turnouts or little turnouts whatever that drive our message wherever the candidate goes to drive his message so that on any given day they will be between them probably in six places so our team makes sure there are events in all those six places every day so it is a lot of events and we try and help define the other candidate 
every morning i am on a call at  that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters added creamer 
he continued 
im in this campaign mainly to deal with what you know earned media with the television radio with earned media and social media not with paid media not with advertising there would be a whole different advertising  everybody is driven on the same tracks though so then there are a couple a bunch of people in the brooklyn office of the clinton campaign that are responsible for possible aspects of communication like we do rapid response and there is a guy there i work with heavily is the guy that i was just communicating with on that kind of stuff for instance we just found i just sent him a note beforehand when we came here that said my understanding is there might be another revelation of another woman talking about trump this afternoon 
creamer bragged again about his ties to president obama 
oh barack obamas was the best campaign in the history of american politics i mean the second one i mean the first was good too i was a consultant to both the second one was everything hit on every level and every aspect 
obama is a pro creamer said ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago 
i was just at an event with him in chicago actually on friday last he is just as good as ever i do a lot of work with the white house on their issues helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in i mean for immigration reform for the the health care bill trying to make america more like britain when it comes to gun violence issues 
the second video  released oct  was a primer on how democrats get away with massive voter fraud 
its a very easy thing for republicans to say well theyre bussing people in said scott foval then national field director for americans united for change 
well you know what weve been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin assholes for  years and were not going to stop now  were just going to find a different way to do it so i mean i grew up with that idea they used to bus people out to iowa if we needed people out there wed bus people out to iowa 
in a discussion okeefe described as focusing on bringing people from one state to another state to vote illegally foval who also worked as deputy political director at george sorosfunded people for the american way pfaw explains how to get away with voter fraud 
instead of bussing people in it is better to have them travel in their own personal vehicles he said 
would they charge each individual of voter fraud or are they going to go after the facilitator for conspiracy which they could prove its one thing if all these people drive up in their personal cars if theres a bus involved that changes the dynamic 
its the legality because you can prove conspiracy if theres a bus he said if there are cars its much harder to prove  if theres enough money you have people drive their povs personally owned vehicles or you can have them drive rentals 
foval says its easy to keep the voter fraud operation a secret so you use shells use shell companies 
democrats are untouchable he said the question is whether when you get caught by a reporter does that matter because does it turn into an investigation or not in this case this state the answer is no because they dont have any power to do anything 
foval explained in the first video how proclinton super pacs communicate with each other and how their information finds its way to the dnc presumably a violation of federal law 
i guarandamntee you that the people who run the super pacs all talk to each other and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication 
were consultants foval says so were not the official entity and so those conversations can be had between consultants who are working for different parts 
he adds 
the thing that we have to watch is making sure there is a double blind between the actual campaign and the actual dnc and what were doing theres a double blind there so they can plausibly deny that they knew anything about it 
the clinton campaign is fully in it veteran leftwing strategist robert creamer confirms on hidden camera hillary knows through the chain of command whats going on 
okeefes group project veritas action fund filed a formal complaint against the clinton campaign with the federal election commission last week 
the complaint states that project veritas 
uncovered a criminal conspiracy where in the words of scott foval the way it works is the hillary for america campaign pays dnc dnc pays democracy partners democracy partners pays the foval group the foval group goes and executes  on the ground this has been done in a manner to evade federal election law and violating coordinated expenditures rules 
the complaint also accuses priorities usa action alliance for retired americans americans united for change and the democratic national committee of accepting prohibited and excessive contributions in the form of coordinated expenditures contrary to federal law and regulations 
the first undercover video okeefe released sent shock waves through the political community 
in that video  released oct  we learned that the frequent outbursts of violence at republican candidate trumps campaign rallies have been orchestrated and paid for by clintons campaign 
the idea was to foment violent at trump rallies in order to create the false impression that his campaign and supporters were violent crazy people and at the same time provide evidence to support the lefts predetermined narrative that the billionaire businessman is a dangerous fascist 
such behavior constitutes terrorism austin bay writes at the observer  
creamer ran what amounts to a domestic us political terror and propaganda operation dedicated to undermining the  us presidential electionrigging the election to use the current term  
the election rigging scheme he commanded relies on street thuggery that means physical fearterroris a core component of americans united for changes crooked enterprise street thuggery is very lowlevel terrorism but it is a type of terrorism nonetheless and it is wrong to call it otherwise hardboy muscle bottles and two by fours are street thuggerys kinetics bottles and baseball bats are not al qaedas high explosivesbut they incite fear and when they crack heads they cause casualties people bleed street thuggery as an arm of politics is violent criminalized politics on an ugly downward slope to much worse the worse including lynchings and pogroms if you dont think street thuggery is terror then consider kristalnacht

Alex Ansary,comey investigation a red herring to cover up wikileaks dump,"russiaus plutonium deal no longer in effect  
russia today president vladimir putin has signed an act suspending a  agreement between the us and russia on reprocessing weaponsgrade plutonium extracted from decommissioned warheads 
the bill has already been published on russias official legal information website meaning its now in force 
it mentions that a decision to restore the agreement can only be made by russias president 
the deal between moscow and washington was ratified in  as a means to safely utilize weaponsgrade plutonium it suggested a specific procedure to turn it into nuclear plant fuel starting from  it was planned to reprocess  tons  pounds of plutonium which would have been enough to produce thousands of nuclear weapons ria novosti reported 
yet while russia has prepared the infrastructure necessary for the process the us said it found the procedure too costly and instead opted for mixing plutonium with special dilutants to store it indefinitely 
russia suspended the deal  due to drastic changes of circumstances the rise of threat to strategic stability as a result of hostile actions of the us towards the russian federation and the inability of the us to provide for the accepted obligations to utilize the excess weaponsgrade plutonium in accordance with the agreement  the new bill read 
for the agreement to be resumed washington should reduce the us military presence on the territory of nato members that joined the bloc after  cancel its magnitsky act which bans entry to the us to a list of russian citizens as well as lift other antirussian sanctions and compensate the loss moscow suffered as a result of such policy 
the bill on suspension  which is a  forced measure  according to russian foreign minister sergey lavrov  was first submitted by the presidents office earlier this month and then approved by parliament

 i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system  
 hillary clinton 
the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy 
those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition ms clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however was representative of this tactic 
while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president and the lgbt community accounts for less than  percent of the american population clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress 
womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion even lateterm abortion which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values primarily christians leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the us at least not at present however judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result 
let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties rather than allowing it to perform its designated function the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see despite being conveniently ignored by the press 
clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization citizens united was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy clinton is quite wealthy and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark unaccountable money the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america someone with whom the clintons also have a long association 
one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power are fundamentally malignant 
in recent days weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign the democratic national committee and the white house 
the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality what all americans  not just voters and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and yes even vote for their candidates 
the burning question is this in the end are we to be governed by the will of the people or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government

when the dust settled on the nov  election we learned that a completely unpredictable egomaniacal narcissistic buffoon would inherit the white house and the vast powers that go along with it this deeply offended many people who see donald trumps racist and misogynistic rhetoric as unpresidential liberal new york times columnist charles blow summed up this view i respect the presidency i do not respect this presidentelect that the presidentelect should not be respected is a given but why should we respect the presidency
the imperial presidency of the united states has evolved over the last century to the point that the executive holds certain powers that can be considered dictatorial arguably the most consequential decision in politics is to wage war the constitution specifically reserves this right for congress the president as commanderinchief directs the wars that congress declares however starting with trumans intervention in the korean war in  and continuing with invasions of vietnam grenada iraq and afghanistan and the bombings of dozens more countries the presidents ability to unilaterally initiate war with a sovereign nation has been normalized congress has not declared war since  despite the fact the us military has intervened in nearly every corner of the world
in recent years george w bush assumed the power to kidnap torture and assassinate any individual anywhere in the world at any time without even a pretense of due process upon replacing bush barack obama legitimized bushs kidnapping and torture by refusing to prosecute the perpetrators or provide recourse to the victims while enthusiastically embracing the power to assassinate at will noam chomsky said obama has trashed the yearold magna carta which king john of england would have approved of
can there be anything more dictatorial than the power of a single individual to kill and make war at will while american presidents thankfully do not have the power to unilaterally impose taxes pass legislation or incarcerate without charges inside us borders the illegitimate authority they do possess to carry out unrestrained violence across the world is unquestionably one feature of a dictator
there has not been a single american president since world war ii that has not exceeded his constitutional authority by committing crimes that would meet the standard by which officials were convicted and executed at the nuremberg trials
roosevelts executive order  to imprison japanese americans in concentration camps was a flagrant violation of the fifth amendment right not to be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law
more wayne madsen the cia has always served the interests of wall street trump won now what will america survive the next  years defeating white liberalism in the age of trump trumans firebombing of tokyo nuclear bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki and invasion of korea violated provisions of multiple treaties that are considered the supreme law of the land per article vi of the us constitution
eisenhowers use of the cia to overthrow democratically elected presidents in iran and guatemala as well as the initiation of a terrorist campaign against cuba violated the un charter another international treaty that the constitution regards as the supreme law of the land
kennedy was guilty of approving the creation of a mercenary army to invade cuba as well as covert warfare in vietnam johnson massively escalated us military involvement in vietnam with the introduction of ground troops which he fraudulently justified to the public through misrepresentation of the gulf of tonkin incident
succeeding johnson nixon waged a nearly genocidal air campaign against not only vietnam but cambodia and laos killing hundreds of thousands of people destroying ecosystems across indochina and leaving an unfathomable amount of unexploded ordnance  which continues to kill and maim hundreds of people each year
ford covertly supported the south african invasion of angola and overtly supported the indonesian invasion of east timor carter continued support of the indonesian occupation of east timor as well as providing military support to military dictatorships in guatemala and el salvador reagan oversaw the creation and operation of a terrorist army in nicaragua sponsored military dictatorships throughout central america and directly invaded grenada
bush the elder invaded panama and iraq clinton oversaw sanctions in iraq that killed as many as  million people carried out an air war from  feet against serbia and bombed a pharmaceutical plant in sudan that produced medications for half the country bush the lesser invaded and occupied afghanistan and iraq obama continued both of those wars as well as dramatically expanding the drone assassination program in as many as seven countries
so i beg to differ with blow and anyone else who claims the presidency deserves respect any institution or position that permits such illegal and immoral actions unchecked should be eradicated and replaced with some alternative that does not allow such concentration of power in the hands of a single person
liberal clinton defender matt yglesias argues that from a historical perspective trump is uniquely dangerous past presidents yglesias writes have simply been restrained by restraint  by a belief that there are certain things one simply cannot try or do
it is hard to take such vacuous proclamations with a straight face as we have seen every single american president since at least wwii has engaged in serious violations of international and domestic law to cause death destruction and misery across the world from murdering individuals without due process to unleashing two nuclear bombs on civilian populations in a defeated country that was seeking to surrender
when trump assumes the presidency he will inherit a frightening surveillancemilitaryincarceration apparatus that includes a targeted killing program a vast nsa domestic and international spying network a death squad the joint special operations command and an extralegal system for indefinite kidnapping and imprisonment at guantanamo bay
partisans see a problem only when the presidency is in the wrong hands if obama is at the helm liberals are fine with unconstitutional mass surveillance or killing an american citizen without charge or trial every now and then conservatives trusted bush to warrantlessly surveill americans but were outraged at the snowden revelations
principled opponents recognize that no one should be trusted with illegitimate authority the handwringing and hyperventilation by liberals about the dangers of a trump presidency ring hollow and hypocritical

Admin,hillary is finished  as the fbi reopens their case into her latest crimes video,"with a supplemantry note by lasha darkmoon on the transhumanist depopulation agenda we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january   their plan is far worse than just cloning hitler and making him president and commander in chief the day of reckoning has arrived  vid rebel i never said i supported donald trump because i liked where he wanted us to go i did say i was interested in the anger of the bernie sanders and donald trump voters on election night a bbc reporter tried to explain how hillary lost that state which has a huge black vote and lots of technically advanced people from out of state in what americans call researchtriangle park obama went there in a last ditch effort to get out the vote he was popular there amongst the college students they had voted for him in  but not so much for hillary in  the bbc reporter told us the people who lived there said they were all bernie voters they had zero enthusiasm for hillary 
i previously quoted mike rivero who had said that if hillary clinton were running in november against godzilla the lizard would have his vote we have seen the hillary koolaid drinkers go crazy after donald won they all live in bubbles where it would have been career suicide to say you voted against hillarys pay for pay corruption 
i have seen a lot of domestic antitrump propaganda from the far right because donald is a zionist i agree with donald that we should stop funding isis and let vladimir putin take them down it was obama who armed isis and let a small band become an international menace overnight by allowing them to take mosul in  and refusing to let the usaf take them out on that highway from syria but i do disagree with donalds intention to confront iran for what resisting zionism 
but fortunately for iran what trump and americas rulers want will soon become irrelevant of course that is not good news for americans who blindly follow the people who think they own the government of the united states 
i have just now seen from europe sheer postelection idiocy some are claiming that donald trump is the puppet of the fourth reich and is backed by the same industrialists and money men that had elevated adolf hitler to the chancellorship in  
it is silly to think that the rockefellers and the rothschilds backed trump 
i do admit that america is run by a criminal elite i had written that catherine austin fitts said the us military and intelligence services had given donald a green light to dish out dirt on hillary these men were on the inside of the vile mechanism that runs america but even they thought hillary was one witch too far to go 
i have reported on the elite end game many times before their plan is far worse than just cloning hitler and making him president and commander in chief far worse 
the people who had owned the governments in the west until recently were the  families and their  minions that is according to david rothkopf the former ceo of kissinger associates and author of superclass 
fortunately for us the people of the us and europe are learning to resist 
i voted once in a presidential election where the democrat was a member of the trilateral commission headed by david rockefeller in north america and sir evelyn de rothschild in europe the republican was a member of the bilderberg society headed by sir evelyn de rothschild in europe and headed by david rockefeller in north america you never read that in our corporate media 
please do not call those people who run hollywood and our tv news nazis they are either jewish or work for jewish companiesthe direct ties of those who thought they were born to rule over us are more to banking than to industry they are not nazis    the transhumanist depopulation agenda ld  in a breakthrough interview on the transhumanist agenda and the  presidential election catherine austin fitts former us assistant housing secretary and publisher of the solari report spoke of the engineered rise of autism gmo proliferation the expansion of entrainment technology the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics and the dumbing down of american students with common core see here  these were all she argued part of an overarching conspiracy to promote a massive transhumanist depopulation agenda this would be achieved by an engineered economic armageddon leading to mass starvation food riots and race wars that would wipe billions of people off the face of the planet how soon this apocalyptic scenario is likely to unfold is anyones guess any moment now many doomsayers declare the coming of donald trump is regarded by many as an omen of the end days ld vid rebel continues 
catherine austin fitts said the bankers stole  trillion from us i think they stole a lot more 
the bankers gave themselves the right to charge us interest on money they created out of nothing in  when they founded the bank of england america copied the bank of england and the german central bank when they drafted the legislation for the federal reserve in  it became law in  just in time for america to create enough unpayable debt at interest to fund ww i 
the united states entered ww i because the elite did not want the allies to accept germanys offer to stop the fighting in  the elite wanted the war to last long enough to bankrupt britain and france to set up a jewish communist dictatorship in russia and to make palestine a british colony for the jews none of that benefited voters in europe or america and the bought and paid for media cannot understand why we despise both them and the  families that sent them 
we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january   
the elite stole all of our pensions and savings they sold hundreds of trillions in bad bets otherwise known as credit default swaps just so they could pocket tens of trillions of dollars in premiums dont cry for them they made people like you ie taxpayers liable for the inevitable consequences for their actions just add another few hundred trillion dollars onto the pile of unpayable debts to be taken out of your pension fund your savings your bank account and your paycheck their malfeasance will become your obligation in the very near future at least that is what they are planning 
the bankers gave you a system in which you cannot have money unless you go into debt the federal reserve will not issue paper money until the treasury gives them a bond obligating us to pay them interest on money they created out of nothing you cannot have checking account money until someone takes out a loan and is willing to pay the bankers interest on money they created out of nothing 
if we had lincolns noninterest bearing greenbacks we would not have  trillion in national debt and be paying  billion a year in taxes to pay the resulting interest 
the recent sharp rise in the interest rate on  year treasury bonds means our financial system is near collapse 
a depression is a period in time when unpayable debts are cancelled en masse since we foolishly have a debt based system that means money vanishes every time a debt is discharged in foreclosure or in bankruptcy court it is this sudden sharp contraction in the money supply that creates all the unemployment 
i have quoted dr steve keen many times before we are headed to the worst financial crisis in the past five centuries because we have more unpayable debts to cancel than at any time in the past  years 
so what is worse than the fourth reich tens of millions of americans starving to death or killing their neighbors because they have nothing to eat 
in short a race war to end all wars 
of course this is what americas elite had planned for them they stole all of the pension funds and the savings they created the trade deals that closed  manufacturing plants and sent millions of jobs overseas they added  million people to the countrys population through legal and illegal immigration they papered over unemployment by using funny money to hire  million federal state and local workers making it appear like everyone was engaged in productive work they used funny money to give out unearned benefits to tens of million of people to minimize starvation until the day of reckoning 
the day of reckoning has arrived 
the  year treasury bonds interest rate at  is at record highs for recent years that means the crash and the nationwide food riots and the race wars will soon be upon us it was only zero interest rates that kept the ponzi scheme going this long 
the only exit path i see is for the us military to be asked to stop the food riots as soon as they begin to ravage the country 
and the junior officers in the military must respond by arresting bankers and seizing their assets to fund debt cancellation 
only debt cancellation will provide a painless way out of the coming financial collapse",darkmoon.me,Fake,english,9.978439716109564,7.981665512530776,79,14,8858,1562,4.632522407170295,1562.0,0.5210227097491011,0.7374756820870908,1.555470409485301,1.6707625426527115,-0.450619107840704,1.7214217346290892,0.0012804097311139,0.0,0.0006402048655569,0,1,0.0,0.0027194168913017,-0.999,0.082,0.142,0.776,Negative,Very Strong

Hrafnkell Haraldsson,it turns out trump put off investigators for  months while he destroyed emails,"interviews syria should be able to choose its allies in the battle against daesh says american political analyst james petras 
the pentagons plan to launch an offensive against the daesh isil terrorist group in syria is only aimed at undermining a successful attempt by the syrian government and its allies to defeat the terror group says james petras an american political commentator 
us defense secretary ashton carter told nbc news on wednesday that the pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust daesh from the syrian city of raqqah the terror groups stronghold in the country 
carter who was in iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of mosul from daesh said the raqqah offensive would begin when iraqs second largest city is cleared 
he claimed that us forces wont be directly involved in any of the operations 
this is a ploy to have the us in northern syria petras said arguing that the us was seeking to undermine international efforts to defeat daesh in a bid to reinforce its own foothold in the conflictridden country 
i dont believe that the attack on raqqah is a positive move because i think it brings the us closer to its policy of establishing a nofly zone in northern syria which will directly affect the efforts of the syrian government and its alliesiran and russiato defend the country 
the analyst noted that raqqah is a problem for the syrian people and damascus should be allowed to choose its allies in the battle 
petras went on to note that carters remarks bear similarities to us democratic presidential candidate hillary clintons plans for a conflagration in the middle east 
the ongoing western efforts in syria have a different nature washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove president bashar alassad from power

USA Today,california national guard members wont have to pay back bonuses,"will china trigger the next global recession current debt level causes grave concern jing jin  misesorg   
chinas debt growth rate has become the focus of some discussions and fair enough from comparing the outright levels it may seem that china can collapse at any moment 
daniel fernandez suggested this in his article  has china reached its debt limit  in mises wire  in response to the governments monetary expansion stimulus plan after the  financial crisis chinas corporate sector did indeed leverage up quickly followed by an equally fast pace of leveraging in the household sector however in order to avoid comparing apples with oranges we need to take a closer look by putting these numbers into perspective using the same data source as used by fernandez we find that chinas total debt as a percentage of gdp was  percent by the end of  debttogdp ratio of corporate government and household sectors stood at  percent  percent and  percent respectively 
for government and household sectors both started from considerably low levels until the last administration kicked in a fourtrillion yuan rmb stimulus plan in  government debttogdp ratio which was kept in the mid s in the first decade of this millennium now stood at  percent by the end of  households debttogdp ratio was at  percent in  and almost doubled to  percent in  and then doubled again to  percent by the end of  the leveraging up of households happened exactly as the chinese society was undergoing rapid urbanization as well as when the government launched its  stimulus 
apart from the demand for urban housing chinese households with their high savings rate and extra cash in hands invested in in real estate as a hedge against future inflation furthermore as the stimulus package allowed for easier lending household debt increased dramatically however we must note that although the debt growth rate was high the absolute debt level of household is still considerably low versus global peers 
the most disturbing trend is found in the corporate sector with the debttogdp ratio increased from approximately  percent prior to  to  percent by the end of  first of all the level of corporate debt mostly in the form of bank loans was high to start with but is by no means out of the norm for a financial system dominated by the banking sector whose funding source is mostly deposits two figures from jonathan andersons how to think about china series provide some insights  
an international comparison of assets of banking system vs domestic saving rate 
breakdown of assets of chinas financial system 
this point can be further demonstrated by comparing financial asset structures for example between the us and china obviously bank loans are the dominant funding source of the corporate sector in china whereas in the us the role of bank loans is far from prominent in comparison with its enormous capital markets where the corporates can raise both equities and bond financing easily 
financial asset structure us vs china  
data source the world bank federal reserve bank shanghai stock exchange shenzhen stock exchange china central deposit and clearing co ltd ccdc sifma 
it is therefore not surprising that the leveraging up as a response to governments stimulus plan manifested itself mostly in the credit extension through the banking system chinas flat yield curve 
the large role of the banks can also be seen in chinas bond market yields and one manifestation of this is a flat yield curve  the reason for this is simple deposits when banks have more deposits to manage than they can lend out they invest these deposits into the bond market and usually on the long end to boost yields this investment strategy or assetliability management scheme bids up the bond prices on the long end hence pushing down the longterm yields 
in addition between allocating deposits to these two types of assets bonds vs loans banks sometimes have incentives to invest in bonds rather than lending due to the balancing considerations of corporate demand credit risks market liquidity and yields that are also subject to interest rate controls that are at final stage of liberalization and the lending rate was completely liberalized only in early  so the yield spread at current stage reflects more of the combination of chinas financial structure and capital flows rather than being a good indicator of economic fundamentals as the government flooded the market with four trillion rmb from the stimulus plan in  bond yields faced downward pressure more so at the longterm end please see the yields of chinese government treasury bonds at maturity  years vs  year and the spread thereof in the below figure wealth management products channel a considerable amount of deposits out of the banking system to capture higher yields outside of bankingsector supervision in form of trusts for example but the amount is still not pivotal enough to change the above explained pattern in a fundamental manner

china didnt open up to the outside world until the very late s now china provides half of the manufacturing goods and close to half of electronic products in the world and the economy is still growing at around  percent obviously a good part of chinas production structure has been configured to export mostly to the developed economies which are dominated by the service sector as the global demand in the developed economies lost its momentum china faces the necessity of reconfiguring its economic structure to better serve its domestic consumers which stands at  times the number of us consumers this reconfiguration process is surely painful as demonstrated by the empty factories in the traditional export production oriented cities but to me this is more of a textbook case of austrian economics at work capital and labor have to be freed up for those productions currently being demanded by the market and this takes time moreover quick capital formation in the past three decades lifted labor productivity with which the manufacturing sector needs to be upgraded and the tertiary sector needs to be expanded to serve a more affluent society comparing with more than  years ago so that chinese consumers dont have to go to japan to buy hitech toilet lids  a healthier skepticism of stimulus 
needless to say the current debt level causes concern and the deeper concern is whether debt growth trajectory will continue ultimately whether or not the debt will grow at the rate of post  stimulus phase is a function of how fast the chinese government runs the money printing press a recent article on the peoples daily  the mouthpiece of china communist party ccp  quoted the diagnosis from an authoritative figure on the chinese economy and its cure this authoritative figure suggested there should be no more money printing to stimulate the economy and that the chinese should be prepared for a lower growth rate comparing with its own historical average of  percent anyone with an understanding of chinas political messaging system would not be mistake it for anything but an opinion handed down from the very top of chinese leadership this can be considered a concluding remark on the policy swings for the past several years 
the xinhua news agency the mainstream media group recently followed with a commentary suggesting resistance to the use of stimulus plans in the face of slowing growth xinhua also warned of a disastrous result if its advice is not followed messages like these are refreshing to hear nowadays among the mantra of the stimulus chorus around the world how chinas policy direction is to be implemented remains to be seen but at least the insidious effects of stimulus is well recognized by those at the top of the regime and openly represented by mainstream media in addition a series of measures to lower tax burdens for corporate and households alike are also being introduced and the central government is pushing hard for businessfriendly deregulations and increasing economic freedom 
china has its problems tons of them china may or may not be the first to blow up in the coming wave of crises as many people say no matter whichever the case i am more convinced that china will be among the first ones to revive  because it has high savings to invest it has a welltrained labor force with one of the most vibrant if not the most complete manufacturing chain and the manufacturing sector still contributes to over  percent of its gdp it is still in the middle of a rapid urbanization process it is not yet a welfare state chinese people are fully aware of the fact that their safety net is the result of their own frugality rather than government promises china has the biggest potential market of  billion people with a rising middleclass that is still increasing in numbers and share in population serving them well is one of the biggest business opportunities in the st century

EdJenner,watch traffic reporters savage message to those who threatened to leave us if trump won," thoughts on steve bannon as white house chief strategist by ben shapiro november   
so in a notunexpected move donald trump has elevated former breitbart news ceo steve bannon to chief strategist of the white house 
when i left breitbart back in march i accused bannon of turning breitbart news into trump pravda  as i wrote indeed breitbart news under the chairmanship of steve bannon has put a stake through the heart of andrews legacy in my opinion steve bannon is a bully and has sold out andrews mission in order to back another bully donald trump he has shaped the company into trumps personal pravda to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter 
that decision paid off for bannon  in august he became trumps campaign ceo at that point i wrote this piece describing who bannon was  and this one for the washington post describing his probable impact on the campaign  
with bannons accession to a top white house role its time to answer some brief questions about the man and what hes likely to do 
is bannon antisemitic and racist i have no evidence that bannons a racist or that hes an antisemite the huffington posts blaring headline white nationalist in the white house is overstated at the very least with that said as i wrote at the washington post in august bannon has openly embraced the racist and antisemitic altright  he called his breitbart  the platform of the altright  milo yiannopoulos the star writer at the site is an altright popularizer  even as he continuously declares with a wink that hes not a member the lefts opposition to trump and their attempts to declare all trump support the altright have obfuscated what the movement is the movement isnt all trump supporters its not conservatives unsatisfied with paul ryan nor is it people angry at the media bannon knows that hes a smart man not an ignorant one the altright in a nutshell believes that western culture is inseparable from european ethnicity  i have no evidence bannon believes that personally but hes happy to pander to those people and make common cause with them in order to transform conservatism into european farright nationalist populism that means that the altright will cheer bannon along as he marbles trumps speeches with talk of globalism  and that bannon wont be pushing trump to dump the racists and antisemites who support trump anytime soon after all they love bannon  actual white supremacists like peter brimelow called his august appointment great news and richard spencer explained breitbart has elective affinities with the alt right and the alt right has clearly influenced breitbart in this way breitbart has acted as a gateway to alt right ideas and writers i dont think it has done this deliberately again its a matter of elective affinities that doesnt mean bannon will push racist or antisemitic policy or that hell be antiisrael himself  unless it serves his interests 
what does bannons accession mean bannon has goals one of those goals is maximization of personal power which is why he spent the last decade and a half glomming onto powerful rightwing personalities bachmann morris palin kissing their asses and then moving on up the chain with breitbart and trump he picked two winners in a row  and that means hes now at the pinnacle of american power 
so what will he do with that power hell target enemies bannon is one of the most vicious people in politics which is why ive been joking for months that should trump win id be expecting my irs audit any moment that wasnt completely a joke he likes to destroy people 
but more importantly bannons interested in turning the republican party into a farright european party because republicans will like some of the policy that comes with that it could happen heres what i wrote in march about the trump movement  
trump is a europeanstyle response to the europeanstyle leftism of barack obama hes a soft europeanstyle populist from his interventionist economics to his closedborders foreign policy as i wrote in december compare trumps platform with that of marine le pen whose french national front poses a significant threat to the national political establishment she calls for harsher penalties for criminals significant restrictions on muslim immigration to france protectionism on trade a restoration of the franc as the national currency rather than the euro and big government in terms of health care this sounds a lot like trump but the european right is not the american right the american right believes in constitutional ideas about checks and balances and federalism and negative rights from government the european right doesnt believe any of these things should trump win we could watch american conservatism lose the only party it has ever had 
thats the plan yesterday the daily beast reported that bannon reached out to le pen for global ultraright coalition over the weekend le pen met with nigel farage of the uk independent party and trump met with farage shortly after being elected bannon has always wanted to burn down the gop thats still his goal he wants it replaced with an american national front party in fact if not in name 
which war will bannon lead bannon considers himself a wartime consigliore  always at war always so the only question left is this what will bannons actual role be its difficult to tell since trump announced the bannon hire at the same time he announced that former rnc chairman reince priebus as his chief of staff what will their relationship be like ed morrissey of hotair thinks that bannon will lead the antimedia fight and reince will coordinate with congress that would be the best possible scenario 
others have speculated that bannon has been added to the team as a sop to the populist base which would be angry at trump hopping into bed with the most establishmenty fellow in washington that too would be fine 
its hard to tell from the outside whats happening but heres a third theory reince is the bagman for trump and bannons whispering in trumps ear that would fit the fact pattern here given reinces outsized praise for bannon this morning wise and smartvery very smart very temperate bannon is anything but temperate to those who disagree hes a consummate bully to anyone who disagrees hes actually malevolent priebus may not have seen a lot of disagreement because hes the one catering to bannons agenda 
if bannons leading and reince is following that bodes ill for the republican agenda bannon opposes the republican party hates paul ryan  minutes after the joint bannonpriebus announcement breitbart news approvingly tweeted about a congressional rebellion against speaker ryan  and wants to watch it all burn bannon loves the firefight the only question is which direction hell turn his fire tags",dailywire.com,Real,english,99.09687615386632,93.82490884357614,87,15,6762,1142,4.892294220665499,1142.0,0.7656230244937624,0.9253763973803462,1.0009281901749194,1.012336610825916,-0.1942498039120281,1.047602062798731,0.0017513134851138,0.0,0.0,0,2,0.0,0.0043379450294205,0.7155,0.116,0.11,0.774,Positive,Strong
No Author,hillarys russian hack hoax the biggest lie of this election season,"november   by shawn helton  comment 
shawn helton st century wire 
the cozy relationship between goldman sachs and the clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years giving the democratic party nominee hillary clinton an immensely influential partner on wall street 
as the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened fbi probe into the hillary clinton s email server case  the global investment banking firm goldman sachs quietly endorsed the democratic presidential candidate this past week 
the financial ties that bind the clintons and wall street banks like goldman sachs are nothing new but never before have the connections been so exposed lets take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago 
money changers wall streets goldman sachs are inextricably linked to the clintons and the clinton foundation photo illustration wire 
the clintons  goldman sachs 
while campaigning for his first term in the white house former president bill clinton received an enormous amount of support from washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on wall street 
at the top of the pile sat goldman sachs 
in  the la times reported that presidential nominee bill clinton received the largest share of his financial supportat least  millionfrom lawyers and lobbyists and that clinton also received additional support from big securities firms such as goldman sachs  co in new york and stephens inc in his hometown of little rock ark in fact goldman sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm  
for decades the clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth goldman sachs and in the process a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold something that even the ny times admits 
over plus years goldman provided the clintons with some of their most influential advisers millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees and financial support for the family foundations charitable programs 
by now there should be little doubt that the clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the wall street banking cartel their relationship was built over three decades 
the real watershed moment came here 
blank check bill clinton laughs with wall street elites after signing the financial services modernization act in  
key to the kingdom 
in one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era the clinton presidency gave big banks like goldman sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely 
the clintongoldman sachswall street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the glasssteagall act  which banking luminaries cynically named the  financial services modernization act of  officially titled the gramm leachbliley act  the original glasssteagall was a depressionage fourpart provision under the bank act of  that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors  the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the great depression  in fact the grammleachbliley act which repealed glasssteagall opened the door for the shadow banking realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk as banks became more interlinked 
simply put clintons repeal of glasssteagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking  which exposed everyone to toxic subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite  which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in  all that can be laid at the feet of one william jefferson clinton and hillary still claims that my husband did so well with the economy really 
in a crossposted article featured at huffington post  nomi prins underscored the complicit nature of wall street and washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the clinton administration during the s 
to grasp the dangers that the big six banks jpmorgan chase citigroup bank of america wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world you need to understand their history in washington starting with the clinton years of the s alliances established then not exclusively with democrats since bankers are bipartisan by nature enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital rest assured of one thing their past and present ceos will prove as critical in backing a hillary clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husbands years in office 
prins herself was a former managing director at goldman sachs senior managing director at bear stearns as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm lehman brothers following the financial crash in  prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled  it takes a pillage  behind the bonuses bailouts and backroom deals from washington to wall street 
prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the glasssteagall act since departing from the investment banking world 
the media outlet common dreams described the merger between citicorp and travelers group becoming citigroup which was dubbed the cititravelers act on capitol hill it was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the clinton administrations influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of glasssteagall 
then in  in an act of corporate civil disobedience citicorp and travelers group announced they were merging such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the bank holding company act  but was excused due to a loophole that provided a twoyear review period of proposed mergers the merger was premised on the expectation that glasssteagall would be repealed citigroups cochairs sandy weill and john reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of congress to make sure a deal was cut 
at the time it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal  as stated by the former bankers of america ceo kenneth guenther  in   after  attempts in  years congress passed the financial services modernization act  which led to the repeal of glasssteagall 
the repeal of glasssteagall was pushed heavily by citigroups coceo sanford weill and lobbyist roger levy and according to a report by the nation  
they laid out more than  million for lobbying in  according to the center for responsive politics and donated more than  million in the  election cyclea figure sure to be topped in  
how much of those contributions made their way to the clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the white house 
in  bill clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private goldman events 
in  after stepping down from her position as secretary of state hillary clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at goldman sachs events to the tune of  dollars in which one attendee said s he sounded more like a goldman sachs managing director according to a quote obtained by politico  indeed clinton gave a glowing speech to the goldman gang and in the process as wikileaks released in early october  the democratic nominee believes in both a public and a private position on wall street reform and that it is an  oversimplification to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis 
that clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics but its only the tip of a much larger iceberg 
in  the washington post reported that hillary rodham clinton and former president bill clinton earned in excess of  million for delivering  speeches since the beginning of  a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid

goldman sachs will pay  billion to settle federal and state probes into the banks sale of mortgagebacked securities before the financial crisis the justice department announced monday 
authorities said goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and  crisis the settlement includes a  billion civil penalty  billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and  million to resolve various other claims 
this resolution holds goldman sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail acting associate attorney general stuart delery said in a statement  
in  a bloomberg article questioned how goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the  economic crisis 
whether goldman could have gone the way of lehman brothers or merrill lynch remains the subject of much debate goldman maintains that it did not need or want the  billion bailout that hank paulson  former goldman alum pushed on it and other firms in october  but the fact remains that when the federal reserve allowed goldman and morgan stanleybut not lehman brothersto become bank holding companies on sept   goldman was able three days later to raise  billion in equity  billion from the public and another  billion from investor warren buffett that would probably not have happened without the feds expedited decision and support a week later morgan stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a  billion equity investment from mitsubishi ufj financial group

the clinton connection to goldman sachs emerged in the early s as robert rubin  a former senior partner with goldman with a year tenure with the firm joined former president clintons economic policy team later becoming secretary of the treasury in  around that time the clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the rubinomics banner aka clintonomics the plan raised taxes on most americans specifically the middle class  in what was said to be the largest increase in american history at the time 
according to congressional record  vol part   in  the economy grew at a sickly   clintons vetoes of spending cuts insured continued deficits well into the st century 
in a multinational monitor report entitled wall streets best investment ten deregulatory steps to financial meltdown by robert weissman and james donahue  a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the s under the clinton administration was revealed 
during the clinton administration treasury secretary robert rubin who had run goldman sachs enthusiastically promoted the legislation in a  testimony before the house banking committee for example rubin argued that the banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago let alone in   us banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically even domestically the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by glasssteagall has eroded significantly 
with a pedigree that included goldman sachs the council on foreign relations cfr the brookings institution and the bilderberg group  robert rubin emerged in  as the vice chairman at citigroup  after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of glasssteagall while serving as secretary of treasury rubin made a fortune with citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the  crash heres a passage from bloomberg regarding rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse 
when it collapsed due in part to bankfriendly policies that rubin advocated he made more than  million while others lost everything you have to view people in a fair light says phil angelides cochair of the financial crisis inquiry commission who credits rubin for much of the clintonera prosperity but on the other side of the ledger are key acts such as the deregulation of derivatives or stopping the commodities futures trading commission from regulating derivatives that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster 
sworn fbi director james comey sworn in by former doj head eric holder image source thewhitehousespin  
under the microscope 
over the summer wire observed some curious connections between the clinton foundation and fbi director james comey  as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the clinton family heres the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the clinton investigation 
many will also be unaware that before comey was installed by the obama administration as fbi director he was on the board of director at hsbc bank  a bank implicated in international money laundering  including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels forbes also points out where comey was also at the key chokepoint during the case involving dodgy auditor kpmg which followed on by the hsbc criminal case 
if comey and his boss attorney general alberto gonzalez had made a different decision about kpmg back in  kpmg would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts hsbc and standard chartered scbff  were committing on its watch bloomberg reported in  that back in june of  comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether kpmg would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations 
in  the guardian discussed the financial relationship between hsbc and the clinton foundation receiving a startling  million in donations from clients of the large bank 
the charitable foundation run by hillary clinton and her family has received as much as m from wealthy international donors who were clients of hsbcs controversial swiss bank 
leaked files from hsbcs swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation with accounts in geneva 
a new update on the fbi investigation into the clinton foundation was announced over the last  hours in addition the recently reopened clinton email probe from last week it remains to be seen how indepth this new investigation will be 
to call it collusion would be an understatement when looking back at the financial affairs of the clintons goldman sachs and others on wall street  its clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate

the fourth high criminal court of bahrain has sentenced  political opponents to long jail terms and also revoked the citizenship of all of them while several international rights groups have criticized the al khalifa regimes harsh crackdown on the bahraini opposition the western powers turn a blind eye to the arab states violations of human rights 
edward corrigan an international human rights lawyer told press tvs top  program that the western powers are trying to whitewash the crimes committed by the arab dictatorships in the persian gulf region because such regimes are considered the wests lap dogs 
there is a double standard corrigan said explaining that western powers say if you are a friend of ours and do what we want and give us oil and invest your money into european or american economy we wont question your human rights violations 
according to the analyst there is hypocrisy double standards and this is really a big political game our dictatorships and allies are ok but somebody else that we dont like for whatever reason we magnify their crimes and even create false flags and do other things to try to discredit them 
elsewhere in his remarks corrigan said the definition of terrorism in bahrain covers any kind of opposition because the regime does not want to allow any sort of political movements there to try to reform the system to redress this massive discrimination against the shia population and to have any sort of voice for democracy so all of that is terrorism 
he added it is against the international law to remove peoples nationality from them and this is an extreme sort of punishment very draconian as theyre condemned by the international human rights organizations and other organizations

the mainstream media is pushing the narrative that the protests spreading throughout the country are peaceful and represent the widespread hatred for presidentelect donald trump unfortunately the media is pushing a false narrative 
fact is theses are not protests according to the law the events taking place are riots under federal law a riot is a public disturbance involving an act of violence by one or more persons assembled in a group of at least three people inciting a riot applies to a person who organizes encourages or participates in a riot it can apply to one who urges or instigates others to riot according to  uscs   to incite a riot or  to organize promote encourage participate in or carry on a riot includes but is not limited to urging or instigating other persons to riot

ever since the telling of biblical fairy tales few stories have lived up to the hype around the mismatch between the shepherd boy david and the giant goliath in the biblical encounter david prevailed by keeping his foe goliath at a distance with a formidable weapon his sling
today a modernday version of david and goliath is playing out
although granted political asylum by ecuador a target of us empire finds himself ensconced under a form of arbitrary detention in ecuadors london embassy under constant surveillance by british police the fully weaponized us empire which boasts of its fullspectrum dominance has arrayed itself and its allies against one unarmed as in having no conventional weaponry man who heads a publishing organization
this uppity publisher has had the temerity to expose the secret machinations and war crimes of the militaryeconomic albeit faltering on both fronts behemoth to the worlds public the protransparency publisher wikileaks its founder and de facto political prisoner julian assange and antisecrecy collaborators infuriated the united states establishment with a slew of documents emails and graphic exposes like the  collateral murder  video that demonstrated a us military engaged in war crimes
nations states are adamant and fastidious about keeping their internal workings under wraps but it is a oneway street as many nation states seek to gather and store any and all information about the citizenry without seeking court approval or the approval of the citizenry in question
more swedish government implicated in charges against assange un body to rule on arbitrary detention of wikileaks founder websavvy wikileaks objects to this double standard and it welcomes vets and publishes troves of secret information premised on the principle of the publics right to be informed about what their government is up to
evidence makes it clear that the violent american establishment engages in browbeating inciting socalled color revolutions to destabilize and overthrow disobedient governments military encirclement and saber rattling this selfdescribed indispensable nation which preens its might before major nation states such as china and russia was not about to have its fullspectrum dominance challenged by punk computer hackers
leaning on its allies the us enacted a financing squeeze on wikileaks many nation states have been severely crippled and devastated by us sanctions but tiny wikileaks proved more resilient and cleverer than the washington schemers
in an attempt to topple wikileaks the us establishment has sought to lop off the head of wikileaks it has kept close tabs on julian assange and is purportedly behind a scheme to bring assange down in sweden we have been warned that the pentagon for example is thinking of deploying dirty tricks to ruin us
in sweden consensual sex has been parlayed as rape in selfdefense assange spoke to the facts of the situation 
here we have a case the swedish case where i have never been charged with a crime where i have already been cleared by the stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent where the woman herself said that the police made it up where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum those are the facts but what is the rhetoric
 the un formally found that the whole thing is illegal never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes i am subject to persecution by the united states
disinformation and distraction are among the underhanded tactics of empire
while in britain assange was eventually placed under house arrest sweden played out the drama while refusing to press charges or interview assange in britain on the allegations it insisted he come to sweden which assange was unwilling to do without an assurance that he would not be deported elsewhere knowing full well that the us department of justice was preparing a case against him sweden refused to give such an assurance which speaks strongly about swedens intent to seek justice for any alleged crimes committed against its citizens
despite all this intrigue wikileaks has continued to publish and assange has continued to give interviews assange did not cower instead he chose to fight back against hillary clinton and the democrats this is because hillary clinton and the democrats are the principals in power and the grand jury investigation into himself and wikileaks has been occurring during their time in government
clinton and the democrats are victims of their own zeal and hubris along the way many outs presented themselves to the democrats they could have dropped the grand jury investigation they could have provided an assurance that there would be no request for assanges deportation from sweden the us could even have given a presidential pardon to assange extremely telling about the caliber of man that assange is is that he offered himself as a prisoner in exchange for the release of another political prisoner chelsea manning
but empire and its minions were dismissive as is the way of empire empire does not negotiate deals it takes what it wants because it believes it can
the result
the corruption in the democratic party has come to light wikileaks revealed that the democratic national committee conspired against party aspirant bernie sanders and heads fell clinton tellingly hired the subsequently fallen dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz
clintons emails were leaked as were those of her campaign chair john podesta revelations include payforplay as they call it giving access in exchange for money to states individuals and corporations a  direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism of isil in the middle east libya more than anyone elses war was hillary clintons war and banks buying cabinet positions
the clinton campaign has predictably been thrown into disarray
the clintonites could not refute what was in their own emails instead they sought to deflect attention elsewhere the clintonites blamed russian hacking for interfering in the us presidential race finally julian assange felt compelled to state 
the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neomccarthy hysteria that russia is responsible for everything hilary clinton stated multiple times falsely that seventeen us intelligence agencies had assessed that russia was the source of our publications that is false we can say that the russian government is not the source
neither is wikileaks complicit with russia
we have published about  documents of various kinds that relate to russia most of those are critical and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia most of which are critical our russiadocuments have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia which they use our documents to back up
graciously toward clinton assange said he feels sorry for the woman who wanted to  drone  him imagine what the response would have been if assange had discussed the possibility of a drone attack against clinton
presently assange downplays the damage from the barrage of leaks to the clinton campaign for the presidency
trump would not be permitted to win why do i say that because hes had every establishment off side trump doesnt have one establishment maybe with the exception of the evangelicals if you can call them an establishment but banks intelligence agencies arms companies big foreign money  are all united behind hillary clinton and the media as well media owners and even journalists themselves
however a counter coup was announced against the coup by clinton cronyism it is said to include fbi cia military intelligence other security organizations through julian assange that have promised to stop clinton from becoming president and to convict and indict her and her cronies
a revolution

Mike Rivero,party corruption clinton campaign directly tied to disgraced dnc consultant,"november   by wire  comments 
patrick henningsen st century wire 
the longer this soap opera drags on its becoming more and more evident that the russian government did not hack into the dnc and moscow is not feeding john podestas emails to wikileaks for those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory this might be a hard pill to swallow 
the white house and the hillary clinton campaign are now married to the idea that putin is hacking the us elections in response the president is weighing his options  tougher economic sanctions revoking diplomatic status to russian envoys in the us or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyberactivity tools 
even vp joe biden wants in on the action threatening moscow by sayingwere sending a message we have the capacity to do it 
it seems that where ever you turn nowadays someone in washington is issuing a threat against russia are usrussian relations really that bad or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the us 
what was previously a stance reserved for rightwing neoconservative hawks and cold war holdouts has now infected americas leftwing and is a firm plank in the democratic party platform as evidenced by hillary clintons constant antirussian rhetoric throughout this  election cycle along with the white house clinton has now transformed the democrats into the vanguard of washingtons new antirussia movement 
on july th josh rogin from the washington post wrote the clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on russia after trump suggested wednesday that if russia had indeed hacked clintons private email server it should release the emails the clinton campaign sent out its democratic surrogates to bash russia and trump in a manner traditionally reserved for republicans 
anyone who was paying attention back then knew this russian hack talking point was purely political but then again whos really paying attention these days certainly not the us media 
you can trace the genesis of the democratic partys hardcore antirussian strategy back to when president vladimir putin made a mild passing remark about donald trumps gop primary success from that point on trumps political opponents saw this as an open target in their words comparing one dictator to another 
never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points president obama got in on the act intensifying the trumpputin narrative to the level of bromance  if youve made a career out of idealizing ronald reagan then where were you when your own partys nominee for president was kissing up to vladimir putin said obama on oct th at a clinton rally in miami 
backed by the obama white house clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming russia  not only for the controversial dnc leaks but also for hacking into us election systems in arizona  a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation the medias coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset in a leading news release entitled  russian hackers targeted arizona election system  we can see how after the cocksure headline the first paragraph would always sound definitive 
hackers targeted voter registration systems in illinois and arizona and the fbi alerted arizona officials in june that russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state 
but then by the time you advanced down the story the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty 
the bureau described the threat as credible and significant an eight on a scale of one to  matt roberts a spokesman for arizona secretary of state michele reagan r said monday as a result reagan shut down the states voter registration system for nearly a week 
and then down to almost nothing 
it turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system they had however stolen the username and password of a single election official in gila county 
at no point was any evidence ever given only ambiguous statements like cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a russian governmentdirected hack 
are american politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their shortterm political ambitions better yet has american political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac translated in french bottom of the bag where politicians in power are so insecure as to makeup and propagate wild international conspiracy theories  in the middle a national election cycle its a very depressing prospect and yet this is exactly what we are seeing in this  presidential election 
behind clintons wild hyperbolic rants about the kremlin and wikileaks you will find the white house 
on october th the obama administration formally accused the russian government of stealing emails from the democratic national committee and other highprofile individuals including hillary clintons campaign manager john podesta  giving them to wikileaks 
soon there was a queue of national security politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon senator ben sasse ner a member of the homeland security committee spouted out russia must face serious consequences moscow orchestrated these hacks because russian president vladimir putin believes sovietstyle aggression is worth it the united states must upend putins calculus with a strong diplomatic political cyber and economic response 
according to a washington post report by technology editor ellen nakashima  the only evidence that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged russian government hacks provided by a us cyber security company called crowdstrike  no actual specifics are given so we are meant to take private firm crowdstrikes word for it 
image crowdstrike cyber security 
the posts nakashima then added 
the administration also blamed moscow for the hack of the democratic congressional campaign committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of democratic lawmakers 
an online persona calling himself guccifer  has claimed responsibility for posting the material those sites and that persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts the joint statement said  we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities 
moscows press secretarys reply this is some sort of nonsense said dmitry peskov 
despite the constant repetition by democrat media surrogates and as cnns maria cardona said last night no us national intelligence agency has really confirmed that russia was behind the email hacks  and still no evidence  other than speculative guesswork has been presented 
likewise us intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that russia did it thus leaving the door open to walkback the accusation at a later date standard washington procedure of ambiguity this little detail doesnt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though it seems that the white house hillary clinton and media operatives like cardona  are quite happy living in what john kerry recent dubbed as a  parallel universe  
still during the final presidential debate hillary clinton proudly crowed how   us intelligence agencies  aka the intelligence community all agreed that russia did it 
the announcement albeit vague actually originated from the office of the director of national intelligence 
we have  intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the kremlin and they are designed to influence our election said clinton i find that deeply disturbing 
whats even more disturbing is the fact that clinton is lying in front of a national audience the highest levels of the kremlin here are clintons  agencies 
air force intelligence army intelligence central intelligence agency coast guard intelligence defense intelligence agency energy department homeland security department state department treasury department drug enforcement administration federal bureau of investigation marine corps intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency national reconnaissance office national security agency navy intelligence and the office of the director of national intelligence 
what does the coast guard intelligence national geospatial intelligence agency or the drug enforcement administration know about john podestas emails answer nothing 
the exact same thing happened following wikileaks first trove of dnc emails back in july   the us government issued a vague accusatory statement but would not actually name the culprit some might call that propaganda 
in both instances the obama administration refused to present any evidence translated there was no evidence if there had been the white house would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the un over washingtons flagging efforts in syria both obama administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for democrats and journalists working for hopelessly partisan outlets like new york times and cnn  none of whom have bothered to press the white house for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the partys decree that russian is hacking the us election process if you actually look at the joint dnidhs statement issued on the matter it contains no definitive statement  the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of russiandirected efforts these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process such activity is not new to moscow  the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia for example to influence public opinion there we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russias seniormost officials could have authorized these activities according to nsa intelligence workerturned whistleblower william binney  when asked about wikileaks and whether the russians are hacking us elections he concluded that the cyber efforts against the dnc were more likely to be the work of a  disgruntled us intelligence worker  
under partisan pressure from senior democrat senator harry reid  the fbi also initiated another investigation into people linked to the trump team with russia reid was unset about the dnc hacks and the podesta emails and demanded the fbi do something about the trump campaign to date the fbi havent come up with anything 
to be fair hillary would have every reason to believe that the kremlin is behind the hack  because her staff read it to her from the campaigns daily intelligence briefings presumably supplied from the us governments much vaunted intelligence community  of course thats the same intelligence community that briefed george w bush about saddams nonexistent nuclear weapons program and who also briefed colin powell about iraqs imaginary winnebagos of death aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior doublewide camper vans so of course they would know if putin directed the dnc leaks and podesta email hacks 
for those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as washington intelligence i can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now no that was iraq that was bush were not like that no this time its different this time we are sure the russians did it 
in  obama claimed that kims notorious bureau  hacked into sony pictures 
this isnt the first time that president obama has cried wolf on a foreign hack and then tried to sell it for political purposes back in december  obama claimed that north korea had hacked sony pictures in hollywood pentagoncia media proxy cnn quickly chimed in to support washingtons conspiracy theory floating a colorful story that kim jingun had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  bureau   just like with todays russian hack theory no member of the mainstream press dared to question the white houses ridiculous north korean claim and like the russian hack claims the only source cited for sony hack was analysis provided by us firm crowdstrike  
jumping the shark 
after their democratic party convention on july th the clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their putin narrative 
soon after a cadre of top clinton national security surrogates then accused trump of emboldening russia in their evil plot to destabilize and dominate the west tom donilon a former national security adviser then accused russia of interfering with elections all over europe and then accused trump is helping russia directly at that point they were in too deep to turn back the biggest impact of wikileaks  shining a spotlight on russias attempt to undermine american democracy and trumps refusal to condemn it httpstcoalzpymbb 
 josh schwerin joshschwerin october   
clinton spin doctors josh schwerin and michael fallon would stoop even lower by accusing rt of having possession of the podesta emails even before wikileaks did their only evidence seemed to be twitter posts by rt news which clinton held up as proof that the kremlin was frontrunning wikileaks email dumps the clinton braintrust failed to note that the podesta emails were posted on wikileaks own website well before rt news had tweeted about them at that point it became obvious that the clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on we then watched as one rt reporter after another dismantled the clinton campaigns desperate claims it was embarrassing 
they could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was wikileaks head julian assange who chose the timing of the release of the dnc and podesta emails rather than attack assange himself who happens to be popular with millennials the very group clinton struggles to connect with her operatives opted to target russia and trump instead 
either way the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger  the clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rearguard mode because based on the content of both the dnc leaks wikileaks files and project veritas video  their own democratic party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization 
their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from democrats and their mainstream media surrogates none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity the results speak for themselves the initial dnc leak of  emails resulted in the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz  they revealed the unthinkable the democratic national committee actively worked to undermine the presidential campaign of bernie sanders in favor of the establishment choice in hillary clinton sanders never had a chance honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process while party insiders and clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened 
to prove this point both president obama and hillary clinton then gave wassermanschultz a glowing endorsement on the way out for the last eight years chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz has had my back this afternoon i called her to let her know that i am grateful said obama not surprisingly clinton thanked wasserman schultz presumably for helping to knock her only competitor sanders out of the democrat primary race i am grateful to debbie for getting the democratic party to this years historic convention in philadelphia and i know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership said clinton 
the party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it 
party meltdown 
wasserman schultzs replacement didnt fair much better dnc vice chairwoman donna brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election but brazile was soon skewered by subsequent wikileaks batches  showing how on more than one occasion she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives  straight to hillary clinton 
 a march  email exchange shows brazile stating that she received a town hall question from roland martin a tv one host who comoderated a march  town hall with cnns jake tapper 
 a march  email shows that she shared a question with clinton campaign chairman john podesta and communications director jennifer palmieri that was to be asked in a march  debate hosted by cnn in flint mich source daily caller  
braziles audacious fraud also helped contribute to her partys planned sabotage of democrat challenger bernie sanders watch brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here 
 completely corrupt and still brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on fox news last week braziles reputation is so bad now that even cnn has severed ties with her  and thats saying a lot 
in addition it was also revealed how cnns head political commentator gloria borger  was named by podesta as one of a shortlist of journalists the clinton campaign would work with to gain favorable coverage youd think that cnn would have dropped borger after this was revealed but no amazingly borger is still leading cnns election coverage 
clearly cnn cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with hillary clinton and the democratic party everunbiased cnns gloria borger refers to being in gop hell and says shell reach out soon to podesta heartwarming podestaemails pictwittercomcqfdcjq 
 lb hacker owens nubianawakening october   
worse than watergate 
perhaps a bigger scandal which the obama white house and clinton campaign operatives would like to bury  is the fbis investigation into the clinton foundation yesterday the wall street journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the fbi and the justice department over whether or not to pursue an investigation into clinton issue 
some investigators grew frustrated viewing fbi leadership as uninterested in probing the charity these people said others involved disagreed sharply defending fbi bosses and saying mr mccabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the justice department and fbi agents pursuing the clinton foundation case it isnt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited but the internal debates about the clinton foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president 
theres more it was also revealed last week how jill mccabe the wife of fbi deputy director andrew mccabe  received  in campaign funds in late  for her virginia state senate run this unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by virginia govterry mcauliffe  a clinton foundation board member after the funds were donated andrew mccabe was then put in charge of the clinton email case in normal times this one scandal would be bigger than watergate but these are not normal times  
so why is washington going all out to deflect to russia  and coverup the clinton scandals and the wikileaks document dumps one reason is because the clinton email issue goes all the way to the top  to the president himself 
what wire reported on oct st is how president obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of hillarys unauthorized private server obama told cbs news on march   that he only found out about clintons server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports the presidents lie was confirmed when newly released fbi documents showed that 
obama used a pseudonym bobamaameritechnet when communicating with thensecretary of state hillary clinton by email and at least one of those emails ended up on clintons private email server 
so not only did obama lie on national tv but he also broke strict white house security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails off grid with hillary clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server  maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system who knows why he did it 
sure hes not the first us president to lie but like richard nixon and bill clinton obama just joined that exclusive liars club  caught out lying to the american people 
on top of this any communications made by the president of the united states are de facto labeled as  born classified  the same goes for any state department communications with other foreign ministers 
coverup john podesta and huma abedin on the hillary campaign jet image abc news  
it should be well known by now after watching both attorney generals eric holder and loretta lynch in action  that the obama justice department doj is one of the most politicized in history bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the hillary email case 
on friday fbi director james comey set the election alight after announcing that the fbi would be reopening the clinton email case  currently examining  emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former us congressman anthony weiner estranged husband of top clinton aid and longtime confidant huma abedin who was snared in a sexting scandal allegedly involving a underaged female so which doj person is in charge of this investigation none other than assistant attorney general peter j kadzik  who is kadzik zero hedge reports 
oh yes recall our post from last week  clinton campaign chair had dinner with top doj official one day after hillarys benghazi hearing  in which we reported that john podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked doj officials the very day after hillary clintons benghazi testimony it was peter kadzik 
oh and if that wasnt good enough kadzik was also podestas lawyer back in  when ken starr was investigating podesta over his role in helping bill clinton internmistress monica lewinsky land a job at the united nations the two were described as best friends fox news confirms 
fantastic lawyer kept me out of jail podesta wrote on sept   to obama aide cassandra butts according to emails hacked from podestas gmail account and posted by wikileaks 
to call the clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement and on the whole americans are sick of it 
russia  the party scapegoat 
former democratic party leader howard dean was so incensed about the fbi reopening the case he accused the fbi director of being in league with russia tweeting ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin ironically comey put himself on the same side as putin 
 howard dean govhowarddean october   
another veteran party operative and lifetime clinton defender james carville  was so upset by the fbi announcement that he accused the kgb working with republicans to hijack the election during his wild rant on msnbc  
i think this an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for comey thats what i think said carville 
maybe someone can remind carville that there is no kgb  and that the soviet union actually dissolved in  
these are just a few scandals surrounding the democratic party and the clinton campaign along with the many exposés revealed through wikileaks and the podesta email batches those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence  unlike the russians hacking the dnc and john podesta and passing those to wikileaks 
suffice to say the democratic party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning wikileaks material and also blame donald trump in the process it should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised hillary clinton over the finish line on november th the washington establishment has concocted the story that putin is trying to influence our electoral process in the us theyve tried to lay this at the feet of donald trump who obama and clinton claim has some secret special relationship with vladimir putin the liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point and antirussian war hawks on the republican side love it too for the white house and the clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep  a perfect double entendre  
the geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold first this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against russia secondly the us could continue to lean on russia in the un over syria previously wire reported how washingtons state dept and un delegations led by the dynamic trio of john kerry  samantha power  and john kirby  already lied when levelling charges against russia for war crimes in aleppo and again while accusing russia and syria of conducting an airstrike on a un aid convoy in syria as we have already shown  that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of usbacked rebels al nusra front or nour aldin alzenki 
with so much at stake geopolitically why would washington lie about a potential world war iii trigger event if they are prepared to lie about this what else are they prepared to lie about 
the demonization of all things russian has definitely accelerated since late  when the us engineered a coup detat in kiev ukraine ever since that its been a goto talking point for ginningup and new transaltlantic arms race as with republican war hawks  and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection like clinton and the democrats when the new year rang in  the newly appointed head of the us broadcasting board of governors andrew lack announced the new challenges facing americas own staterun media arm that includes us overseas propaganda assets including voice of america radio free europeradio liberty the middle east broadcasting networks and radio free asia lack said  we are facing a number of challenges from entities like russia today which is out there pushing a point of view the islamic state in the middle east and groups like boko haram he was forced to resign shortly after that 
whats clear is that when it comes to all things russian there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this us administration the list is too long to chronicle here although  russianbacked rebles shootting down mh  and  assad regime sarin attack in damascus in   certainly comes to mind 
that said its hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the russia government a world nuclear power and member of the unsc of hacking into the us electoral process when you examine history however what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the us government and the cia have altered and flipped  foreign elections throughout history the attempted assassination of over  foreign leaders  knowing all this one might find it hard to take seriously washingtons claims that putin and trump are trying manipulate the  election 
on oct   russian foreign minister sergei lavrov laid it all on the table 
we have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive russophobia that now lies at the heart of us policy towards russia its not just a rhetorical russophobia but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security 
selfserving career political operatives in washington are playing a dangerous game history will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the obamaclinton era 
knowing what we now know about the nsa and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone anywhere  if washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from maybe they could start there far be it from anyone in washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry 
still were waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in washington  before its too late

russia says it has cancelled plans for a fleet of its warships to refuel at a spanish port on their way to syria 
vasily nioradze a spokesman at the russian embassy in madrid said on wednesday that the request was canceled without giving further details the associated press reported 
the spanish foreign ministry also confirmed that russia had withdrawn its request for the warships to refuel in the spanish port of ceuta 
the russian embassy in madrid has just told us that it is withdrawing its demand for permission to stop over for the boats which means that the stopovers have been cancelled the ministry said in a statement on wednesday 
the development came after spain a nato member state said it was reviewing russias request to refuel its naval fleet at ceuta after passing through the straits of gibraltar en route to syria where russian forces are engaged in an antiterror campaign in support of the syrian government 
in a statement released on wednesday the spanish foreign ministry said that spain had been allowing russian navy ships to dock in spanish ports for years but that it treated such requests on a case by case basis 
the naval group which passed through the english channel on friday is made up of russian aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov as well as a nuclearpowered battle cruiser two antisubmarine warships and four support vessels escorted by submarines 
the fleet will join around  other russian vessels already off the syrian coast 
ceuta sits on the tip of africas north coast across the straits of gibraltar from mainland spain and bordering morocco the port is part of the eu but its nato status is unclear since  at least  russian warships have docked in ceuta 
nato irked by spains announcement 
nato secretary general jens stoltenberg claimed that the western military alliance was concerned by the deployment of the russian warships 
it is each up to each nation to decide as has been nato policy for many years but we are concerned about the potential use of this carrier group to increase attacks in aleppo stoltenberg said adding all allies are aware of our concerns 
britain echoes natos stance 
british defense secretary michael fallon also said on wednesday that london would be extremely concerned if spain refueled the russian carrier group heading through the mediterranean towards syria 
nato should be standing together he added 
since march  syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some western states and their regional allies russia has been conducting air raids against daesh and other terrorist groups in the middle eastern country at the damascus governments request for more than a year now 
russia boosts baltic fleet 
in another development on wednesday a report said that russia was reinforcing its baltic fleet in kaliningrad with two small warships armed with longrange cruise missiles to counter a worrying nato buildup in the region 
the report by russias daily izvestia quoted an unidentified military source as saying that the vessels the serpukhov and the zeleny dol had already entered the baltic sea and would soon become part of a newly formed division

EdJenner,report new york times profit plummets,"desperate obama rips comey we dont operate on innuendo by november   
barack obama must be pretty worried 
earlier this week white house press secretary josh earnest told the media that fbi director james comeys decision to reopen an investigation into hillary clinton didnt spring from bias or politics he explained  
director comey is a man of integrity and principle and well regarded by officials in both parties and served as a senior position in the bush administration and got bipartisan support when his nomination to be director of the fbi was considered by the united states senate they speak to his good character and the presidents assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed for example the president doesnt believe that director comey is trying to influence the outcome of the election and the president doesnt believe hes secretly supporting a candidate or political party hes in a tough spot hes the one who will be in the position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including officials who served in senior justice position for presidents led by both parties 
now with the polls closing to within the margin of error president obama has had second thoughts he told nowthisnews  
i do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we dont operate on innuendo and we dont operate on incomplete information and we dont operate on leaks we operate based on concrete decisions that are made when this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the fbi the conclusion of the justice department the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasnt anything there that was prosecutable 
its worthwhile pointing out the hypocrisy here  obamas entire administration has been built on innuendo his department of justice has destroyed police departments around the country with unsubstantiated innuendo about systemic racism his irs used innuendo to destroy conservative cs his entire  campaign was rooted in innuendo about mitt romneys supposed secret evils 
but more than anything the obama flip here shows serious desperation what changed the polls on monday it looked like the fbi scandal would detract from hillarys polling numbers but wouldnt kill her now it looks like she might go down in flames this shows how faithless obama is  comey was wonderful just up until the point he threatened hillarys chances at which point he became a slanderer trafficking in innuendo 
if comey has any stones he should resign in protest at obamas accusations hes already been thrown under the bus by his commanderinchief for not playing dead for him long enough to move hillary into the white house hes got no future in his position no matter what he does it would be a final redeeming move of honor to tell obama and his cronies to stuff it now tags",dailywire.com,Real,english,99.09687615386632,93.82490884357614,37,6,2904,484,4.971074380165289,484.0,-0.763128942660371,-0.7657300402589515,-0.0197893108267277,-0.0191973490360637,-0.1165015125073328,-0.0080487564021635,0.0041322314049586,0.0,0.0,0,2,0.0,0.0102353992223103,-0.0439,0.121,0.111,0.768,Neutral,Neutral

gop nominee donald trump who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him shot out a tweet thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines flipping to register votes for hillary clinton when voters choose trump 
a lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in texas trump tweeted 
people are not happy big lines what is going on a lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in texas people are not happy big lines what is going on 
 donald j trump realdonaldtrump october   
as infowars has highlighted  there have already been numerous reports of early voters in texas seeing their ballots flipped from donald trump to hillary clinton a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
while election officials have dismissed the reports suggesting user error is to blame tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time 
larry norden a voting technology expert told npr that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed 
over time as people vote that calibration becomes less and less accurate norden noted 
during elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines flipping indeed the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as the simpsons drew attention to it 
meanwhile the washington post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering trumps rigged election claims 
callum borchers author at the washington post blog the fix writes since the final presidential debate last week many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to donald trump supporters your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election nov  a day later the timess upshot blog increased clintons chances of winning to  percent  an alltime high on monday politicos ben schreckinger wrote that  donald trumps path to an election night win is almost entirely closed  here at the fix chris cillizza and aaron blake wrote that  donald trumps chances of winning are approaching zero  these are accurate statistically sound statements but they are something else too declarations that trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the republican nominees warning that the rigged election could be  stolen from us  
the latest polls which trump insists are rigged due to oversampling show clinton with a double digit lead 
however hillary clintons campaign manager robby mook has warned that trumps suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are absolutely right 
weve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before election day mook said urging clinton supporters to vote 
make no mistake with only  percent of votes cast donald trump could win this election mook said   ",prisonplanet.com,Fake,english,20.8,12.500754447675927,57,10,2937,489,4.936605316973415,489.0,-0.1516281557987176,-0.0141271790859303,-0.0110584457326234,-0.0113589450857447,-0.1505190974742158,-2.7093642278320917e-05,0.0061349693251533,0.0,0.0040899795501022,0,0,0.0,0.0103304736102696,-0.7047,0.075,0.09,0.835,Negative,Strong

remington researchs summary of the polling data asserted that the race has become increasingly competitive 
last week we found a presidential race where hillary clinton held a clear advantage this week we find an increasingly competitive race with just eight days to go trump appears to be holding strong in his mustwin states and colorado remains within the margin of error the data also show that pennsylvania has moved into the margin of error category 
the presidential race remains very competitive as we move into the final stretch hillary maintains an advantage leading in colorado and pennsylvania but at this point anything can happen said titus bond director of remington research group 
other state polling data came out on sunday that also showed a closerace between trump and clinton although the polls were surveyed before fbi director james comeys announcement that they were reopening their investigation against clinton  via realclearpolitics  florida new york timessiena trump  percent clinton  percent nbcwall street journalmarist clinton  percent trump  percent gravis clinton  percent trump  percent colorado cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent arizona cbsyougov trump  percent clinton  percent north carolina nbcwall street journalmarist clinton  percent trump  percent gravis clinton  percent trump  percent cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent pennsylvania cbs newsyougov clinton  percent trump  percent 
the fact that some of these polls were close even before the comey announcement led to this observation from fivethirtyeights nate silver both things can be true  comey impact overblown  nate silver natesilver october   
radio host steve deace writes at conservative review that while early voting has been overwhelmingly in favor of clinton the renewed fbi investigation could have a potentially huge impact on election day 
trump was on defense on the election map as he had to defend states like arizona georgia utah indiana and alaska that rarely go blue on election day its quite conceivable that yet another reminder of the stench of corruption that has long surrounded the clintons could sway the bulk of republicanleaning undecideds trumps way but thats provided of course that he can withstand his compulsion to negatively influence a favorable news cycle as hes been prone to do then theres the matter of trumps emerging evan mcmullin headache in utah 
if trump can be disciplined this final week his campaign may have the freedom to focus its efforts on iowa nevada florida ohio and north carolina those five states would get him within striking distance to  electoral college votes and then you hope you can pull an upset in colorado pennsylvania or new mexico where trump is visiting during the campaigns final week the hope is that theres enough voters in those states wearier of clintons corruption than worried about whether trumps fit for office

Harun Yahya,gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters by shooting in their heads,"bill clinton and his cabinet members pursued antiindia activities and as secretary of state hillary did the same as president she will no doubt continue to bully india  shares
   
there are only weeks left until we find out if we have a president trump or a president clinton donald trump is perceived as the candidate who is against the corrupt establishment while hillary clinton is seen as part and fabric of the establishment and as the most corrupt candidate to run for president in the history of the country
a president clinton in a few weeks would return us to the hostile climate towards india that we saw in the s overseen by her husband after he took office in  the us relationship with india went on a considerable downslide for nearly a year clinton did not bother appointing an ambassador to india even as he went about opposing india on multiple fronts leading to anger in the indian establishment initially he was intent on disarming and weakening india by preventing access to technology and also mounted a sustained attack on the indian economy by imposing several economic sanctions
in  senator joe biden who is now the vice president under barack obama introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to russia making the aid conditional on the fact that russia could not sell cryogenic engines for indias space programme the clinton administration was hellbent on hurting the development of indias space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of cray supercomputers that had been approved under the ronald reagan administration india was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the super  clause of the american trade law
these economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way mr clinton attacked the indian textile and carpet industries throughout the s the terms dunkel draft super  wto and patent laws became synonyms for the us attempts to retard the indian economy and led to many protests in india
by  india was justified in believing that indous relations had hit the lowest point but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during bill clintons second term in office madeleine albright became the new secretary of state and she was increasingly hostile to india especially through her pseudoracist television outbursts in fact she loved attacking india so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in kashmir justifying the actions of violent groups in the process
more clintons policies look like a death sentence for americans  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital remember this is the same bloodsoaked albright who advocated bombing yugoslavia and then got her investment firm to attempt a takeover of mines in that country like the clintons she also knows how to abuse her power lest we forget albright also justified the deaths of half a million iraqi children and claimed that the deaths were worth it and the icing on the cake for this particularly nasty woman albright has already threatened women in america and claimed that there was a special place in hell reserved for them if they did not vote for hillary clinton
there is already talk of joe biden in the frame as secretary of state under hillary clinton biden would continue his antiindia agenda and try to thwart the development of indias space programme and other technological advancements then of course there is hillarys closest confidante a duplicitous lady called huma abedin who is of pakistani descent and whose family has links to radical elements in pakistan and saudi arabia abedin could end up playing an important role in determining american foreign policy and would be certainly antimodi
another point against hillary clinton is that the hawkish henry kissinger has supports her and her oeuvre as secretary of state this is the same kissinger who is so hostile against india many of his racist statements are even on tape to that end
it is in the light of this setting that many indianamericans have opposed the candidacy of hillary clinton and have come out in support of donald trump in contrast to the policies of the clintons trump has promised to make india the best friend of the us and has stated that he looks forward to working with prime minister narendra modi trump has also reached out to hindus in us while there is always a risk of the unknown and it is not clear if trump can make the change he wants to a hillary presidency will certainly be a major step back for india
in order for india to build a constructive relationship with us it requires people in both countries to have good intentions it is clear that india cannot have a strong and forward looking relationship with the us if hillary clinton is running the corridors of power on the other hand donald trump has articulated the right intent and his stance holds promise for india",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,3.528806933996037,100,15,4978,848,4.8584905660377355,848.0,1.163098535953837,0.9253763973803462,0.528932331754251,0.551438458547159,-0.2276106958831851,0.5759282925174802,0.0011792452830188,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0029209511931593,-0.9006,0.088,0.101,0.811,Negative,Very Strong

the more things change the more they stay the same the house freedom caucus is planning a secret meeting which in typical republican fashion was leaked to the press to discuss ousting paul ryan and demanding more ransom from gop leadership 
politico reported  one of the most pressing questions preoccupying washington is what the group will do about paul ryan the wisconsin republican has said he intends to seek another term as house speaker but has rankled members of the group of several dozen republican lawmakers that drove john boehner out of the speakership last year the freedom caucus is also weighing proposals meant to empower its members some at the expense of gop leaderships authority 
there have been early rumblings that speaker ryan may be open to making a few deals on policies like tax reform with hillary clinton if she wins the election one of the reasons why these deals may never happen is because of the ability of far right republicans to cause trouble 
if ryans republican majority shrinks he will be an even bigger hostage to the farright wing of his caucus the dysfunctional dynamic in the house is going to continue even if hillary clinton wins the election ryan has run into the same hurdles that john boehner faced house republicans are deeply divided and unable to agree on much of anything 
the fact that the freedom caucus is holding a secret meeting is a sign that nothing is going to change if paul ryan doesnt cave to their demands they will force ryan out of the speaker position 
a group of house republicans is plotting new ways to keep the house from working properly before a new president has even been elected

wayne madsen it is classic sorosfunded color revolution soros is financing moveonorg black lives matter demos and other of his groups to turn out protesters and is even running ads in papers looking for paid drivers and protest coordinators
in your very relevant books devoted to george soros soros quantum of chaos you reveal the true face of this figure who is the spearhead of several destabilization operations in the world from where does all the power come that this criminal holds and why is he untouchable
soros is very wealthy and actually a frontman for an even more powerful and wealthy person evelyn de rothschild along with his family they are all the true puppet masters of the world
soros remains a major element in the antitrump device can trump resist him
more disrespecting the american imperial presidency trump won now what will america survive the next  years defeating white liberalism in the age of trump trump is actually now being surrounded by people who will serve in his administration who will be loyal to the sorosrothschild puppet masters and certainly not to trump
can we say that the occult world is more powerful than legal institutions
secret societies with their crazy rituals have been the bane of human existence since the time of the sanhedrin and pharisees in palestine and the dionysian cults of the nile valley and the mediterranean region
in your book  isis is us  the shocking truth behind the army of terror you detail the relations between the usa and isisdaesh what is the triggering element that has put you on this trail
trumps national security adviser retired lt gen michael flynn revealed that the us was supporting isis and then he was forced to resign my own sources in the middle east confirmed this long before flynn made his public statement and was fired as defense intelligence agency chief by obama
you mention western sahara and the involvement of the clintons in a deal with the kingdom of morocco while this case is under the authority of un arent the clintons outlaws such bonnie and clyde by supporting morocco against the sahrawi people and the uns resolutions
the clintons received at least  million from the moroccan government in return for buying their loyalty to moroccos agenda which includes permanently annexing western sahara as the southern province morocco and israel share the same policy on annexing illegallyoccupied territories

before i was an fbinavy whistleblower in  and helped to uncover a major pedophile ring in the us navy that reached into the reaganbush white house and was ultimately exposed in the washington times in  my whistleblowing cost me my navy career however and a subsequent series of fairly bad jobs
in the recent us election we saw the mass media bankruptcy despite their manipulations and their fake polls didnt one of the pillars of world oligarchy collapse under our eyes dont we witness a historic moment announcing the end of the new world order and its purely capitalist product globalization
 percent of major newspapers endorsed clinton many alternative news sources supported trump we are seeing a massive shift away from newspapers and corporate tv and websites to the alternative media of which waynemadsenreportcom has been prominent since its founding in 
snowden has denounced the prism program and you have denounced echelon both of which serve the interests of the worlds oligarchic caste what is known is not only the immersed part of the iceberg
what is still relatively unknown is the close cooperation between nsa and private companies like microsoft apple google facebook and major telecommunications companies it is much greater than even snowdens documents describe
the quantity and especially the quality of your reports reveal to us a world unknown by millions of human beings how all these truths have been hidden
the major media cooperates with the government in covering up news events
i advise everyone to read the wayne madsen report as well as your books and follow your various interventions in the alternative media how do you explain that we who are resisting to what i call the fascist oligarchic caste are called conspiracy theorists is this concept the only weapon of the fascist imperialists to reduce to silence all those who resist them and to reinforce the ranks of those whose who have been brainwashed
the term conspiracy theorist was developed by the cia in the mids to ridicule those who believed there was a wide government role in the assassination of president kennedy it has been used ever since to describe legitimate researchers into irancontra  and other deep state crimes
your book  the star and the sword  is one of the few to talk about intimate and opaque links between the zionist entity of israel and saudi arabia you claim that they organize false flag attacks including the  what is the origin and nature of this israelisaudi strategic alliance do you think that the jasta law will succeed or will it be countered by the zionist allies of saudi arabia do the fact that the usa and the westerners turn a blind eye on the criminal war led by the saudis to yemen isnt due to the weight of the lobby zionist
the zionistwahhabisaudi alliance goes back to ibn saud who wrote the british and zionist leaders that he did not oppose a jewish homeland in palestine so long as it did not lay claim to saudi territory on the eastern shore of the gulf of aqaba the relationship has always been close except for the time of king faisal who was conveniently shot in the face and killed by a relative
do you undergo pressure or threats in relation to the remarkable work you do if so how do you live it

the fbi entered my apartment in washington at least twice and ive had three visits by them at my new home in florida
i was informed of  personal threats in washington
i ignore all these pressures and continue to exercise the freedom of the press

she continued so much so in fact that im proud to say that no important people were lost through it all and when i say that i say it with the utmost respect for all those who had to give their lives on both sides so that libyans could be freed from the iron fist of gaddafi it would have been unrealistic to expect  casualties however the overall toll did not exceed expectations with the greater amount of damage being on the side of the enemy 
politics can be a cruel line of work that being said i stand before you here today and i am proud to say that giving democracy to a people that have not had any contact with it for generations is a wonderful thing that makes all of the sacrifices worth it and while were on the subject of sacrifices thank god they did not include anyone important from the american delegation including yours truly she said jokingly causing the auditorium to laugh 
she said but all jokes aside i have to pay homage to the cia who has once again performed outstandingly and saved the day its agents work in the field is an immeasurable contribution and an asset that we would be wise to treasure for generations to come if it hadnt been for them we would not have been able to perform the operation so cleanly and with such little impact to the surrounding nations i am proud that the united states of america has an intelligence agency such as the cia 
im sure many here among you disagree with my position that one embassy is a small price to pay a bargain if you will when it comes to ridding the world of another dictator and a terrorist i would also like to remind everyone here that that price would have gone up immeasurably if we had sat idly by and allowed gaddafi to rage on and cause death and destruction throughout the region for better of worse we acted and i am convinced no other dictator will ever again think about cheating the cia out of a deal because in the words of a personal friend of mine who is a former cia spook  shutting down arms dealers is easy finding trustworthy partners among nation heads is the hard part she concluded",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,74,13,2877,526,4.448669201520913,526.0,0.3681475130336877,0.5495749667938356,-0.0269327459037221,0.0466452441466157,-0.6320641912129149,0.0593332107808722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9925,0.187,0.116,0.697,Positive,Very Strong

Adalia Woodbury,trump thug chants jews s a at arizona rally,"interviews us democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton stands with president barack obama during an election eve rally on november   in philadelphia pennsylvania 
the american people have repudiated the foreign policy of president barack obama and former secretary of state hillary clinton which was a complete disgrace for the united states according to james fetzer an american scholar and political analyst 
professor fetzer made the remarks in a phone interview with press tv on monday days after republican presidential nominee donald trump stunned the world by defeating the heavilyfavored democratic candidate hillary clinton in the november  election 
during the election campaign trump repeatedly expressed his willingness to work with russian president vladimir putin and other leaders in order to resolve global problems including the issue of daesh terrorism which he has blamed on the policies of the obama administration 
on the other hand clinton has shown eagerness to confront russia and continue the interventionist policies us administrations have practiced since  
professor fetzer said that clinton was behind the massacre of libya the butchery of benghazi the transfer of weapons to rebels in syria 
more than five years after the overthrow of muammar gaddafi libya has become a failed state with the central government holding no sway over the country and africas wealthiest nation has become a haven for terrorist organizations 
and since  the united states and its allies have been sponsoring terrorists wreaking havoc in syria 
professor fetzer stated that clinton was being advised by israeli intelligence telling her how to conduct american foreign policy it was a complete disgrace 
the american people have repudiated the foreign policy of barack obama and hillary clinton the scholar said 
donald trump is going to restore a measure of sanity he is going to end the wars in the middle east he is going to restore the reputation of the united states for integrity and dealing with the international community he noted 
he respects russia as should any president of the united states where barack obama and hillary clinton fell miserably short the analyst pointed out 
i believe we are already seeing signs that the situation for the world community is going to vastly dramatically improve that the united states is going to conduct itself in accordance with international law and restrain from regime change and hopefully we will no longer be the greatest aggressor nation in the world fetzer said in his concluding remarks loading",politicususa.com,Real,english,100.0,83.52880693399604,43,9,2568,402,5.348258706467662,402.0,-0.579678706601875,-0.2020278943791856,-0.1086853917848804,-0.1477471738212953,0.2557424268403475,-0.1396040256642811,0.0024875621890547,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0039799432444499,-0.7964,0.108,0.121,0.771,Negative,Very Strong

Roosh Valizadeh,watch how i make my own bread at home with a bread machine,"as feminism erodes down to its tattooed lesbian core we should stop and take a moment to wonder what the point of the third wave part of feminism was although it ultimately proves destructive to western societies to give women equality at least the first and second wave had something legitimate to bitch about third wave feminism not so much and today well talk about the underlying motives and the end game of it all
when one looks at modern feminism you see women who have flipped the script to use their term and rewired life so that men are not necessary for them a modern feminist has her own job that can meet her needs but maybe not all her wants and has her own small place with her cats and netflix when she wants the company of men she goes out and sluts it up and is always successful due to the biological imperative of men
on the surface a feminist woman may appear to be the analog of a red pill man yet upon closer examination she is actually an imperfect copy a man works harder more dangerous jobs and makes more money because of it thus he has money for anything he wants and more a proper man has interesting hobbies and a healthy fit lifestyle and he must do this to fulfill his potential and inner drive but also because he realizes that normal men do not get laid due to hypergamy and he must be the best he can be if he wants to be successful with women
however the most crucial difference lies in the outcome women who outlast their shelf lives while still being single are miserable and i fully expect the suicide rate of women of my generation to skyrocket in about  years from now men whose value is based on their production and can enjoy a later in life peak than women also can live for other things than companionship and family and can be quite happy on their own even if they did want a family at one time or still do
so the question is if women despite their feminist pandering to the contrary actually do want a man to live with and grow old with why is third wave feminism devoted to stopping that in every which way the answer like most things lies in the red pill philosophy women including feminists only want the best men modern feminism is nothing more than a nuclearlevel shit test
a woman needs an alpha man like a fish needs water sjw society today tells us that men are not supposed to hit on women in the grocery store in the bookstore or at the coffee shop because thats a precursor to stalking or some shit at night youre not supposed to hit on girls at the bar or club because they are there with the friends and not looking for that at work youre not even supposed to talk to women about anything other than workrelated topics because thats harassment
if you are wondering where is a guy supposed to meet girls then you get the point and the answer is that youre not feminists and women in general know that any man who actually allows them to regulate his behavior is not a man worth having in the first place so they are only interested in men that see that the answer to feminisms constraints is to ignore them in the first place

combining the above shit test with hypergamy will result in a winning combo if a man is successful good looking and alpha enough he has a good chance of pulling another mans wife directly out of their marriage and family and taking her away women are ultimately interested only in their own self interest and that means when confronted with the best man she has ever beheld she will go against feminism because it is not in her own best self interest at the time and instead be receptive to the man in hopes of snaring him
ultimately women do still need and want men they just dont want to be bothered by inferior men and third wave feminism does a good job of convincing the betas to stay away until they are wanted for their paychecks by postwall nascarstyle wrecks of women
when is enough enough when you look at feminism logically which is hard you can come up with the premise that women have been disadvantaged over history and feminism is an effort to balance the scales they will disguise it in selfdepreciating irony feminism is the radical notion that men and women are equal but what they really men is that men and women should be equal over the balance of history and since women have been so disadvantaged men had better get ready for some suck to square the accounts
i bet shes been in  rok articles by now
the question then follows if men owe women how much are we talking can it ever be paid off or have women been so heinously treated over the entirety of our existence that there will never be enough atonement to make up for it i have three theories
it could be that men have apparently treated women so badly for all time that it can never be paid off because its an absolute the problem with absolutes is they lack scope the worst atrocities in history have been borne by both men and women alike and it could be said that men have borne the heavier half as they are usually expected to die before defeat in war whereas women although they get raped by the conquerors at least get to live i doubt most women have been treated that badly though on the balance so there is probably some finite amount of penance men would do to restore equality
the other two theories center on the idea that eventually men will atone for all faults perceived by feminism and the only difference lies in what happens then my second idea is not a noble one but it is probably the most accurate feminists you see are not for equality they are for female supremacy and once equality is reached women will get to be on top for millennia some would say we are already at that point and this is why anyone who is not a feminist can see why the movement has faltered and lost whatever relevance it ever had when you already have it all shouldnt you stop and try to actually make things equal that is if you actually have moral integrity
thats the third idea the concept of once all debts are paid true equality would rule i doubt this one would ever happen as our victimhoodempowerment culture makes it advantageous to be a victim and you cant be a victim if your demographic is on top plus being feelers not thinkers the average woman lacks the intellectual capacity to be honest with themselves
conclusion combining the idea of feminism being a massive shit test to guys and a scam to win money and prizes from society just because you have a vagina one can see that the only solution is to treat it like the cult bullshit it is while that is nothing new for those of us here at return of kings  and nothing new for those our message reaches the reason we must treat it like that has hopefully been a little more exposed to the light here
the reason that feminism makes no sense and makes it seem like all men have no way to succeed and must lose everything is because that is precisely the point there is no way to win there is no equality there is only female superiority males that go along with it and men that do not

Harry Abrams,no title," shares
   
i grew up in a working class family and have experienced the deep racism of a society that views vietnamese americans as the targets of war ive lived through successive democratic party administrations with little to celebrate the bill clinton era brought nafta which outsourced my aunts union job and forced her into the lowwage service sector my mother never found a living wage job and relied on my fathers public sector union position to meet our familys needs in the st century obama expanded bushs war on terror which merged my fathers job with into the department of homeland security
downward pressure on wages and working conditions forced my father to refinance our home multiple times to pay college expenses for my sister and i even then my sister and i graduated with large sums of student debt i have worked four jobs in three years and only one has paid a truly living wage another four years of a democratic party president was not going to make anything better for my family that is not to say that donald trump was the answer to the structural problems of exploitation but trumps victory is not the end of the world either
trumps victory is the product of global capitalisms decay millions of people voted for trump for a variety of reasons namely because he clearly labeled problems and outlined solutions to them i dont agree with all of his solutions white nationalism stains his domestic and international agenda trumps call to further militarize the usmexico border yet make peace with russia is a contradiction in and of itself a white nationalist billionaire who speaks the language of racism on the one hand and the interests of peace on the other is not exactly a model of consistency
however trumps consistency is not the most important aspect of this election millions of people have shown their disgust with the twoparty system of the capitalist class a number of mostly white workers and whites from the petty business class voted for trump trump also received more votes than expected from the black and latino electorate meanwhile the elections produced a low turnout for clinton from the historic democratic party bases of black voters latino voters and women voters clinton may have won the electoral vote but the balance of forces ensured the ruling class would gamble on trump trumps base of white workers and petty business elites angered by thirty years of monopoly capitalist assault are more of a threat at the moment than the millions of democratic party voters who are now without a home the round table of elites called the electoral college could not afford any more damage to the democratic party than what transpired during the election
so the democratic party is now on its deathbed and there is only one class of people willing to resurrect it white liberals a large section of the democratic party base wanted bernie sanders to be their next president they did not hold their nose for clinton the legitimate concerns that immigrants and oppressed people possess with trumps racism should not be led into the bowels of the democratic party yet for white liberals this is the ultimate mission
more brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired the significance of the gops attempted purge of donald trump trumps victory has energized the white liberal section of the united states to fight back white liberals began the process in a deep state of mourning over clintons loss they then placed blame for trumps victory on russia lowvoter turnout and the white working class white liberals have blamed everyone except hillary clinton and the democratic party now white liberals in the us hope to wage a crusade against trump in hopes of a democratic party recovery it is all too clear that their primary intention is to get ahead of the genuine forces that rejected both trump and clinton and lead them into the democratic party graveyard
white liberals love to hide their own racism and ruling class sensibilities through a process of appeal and betrayal they speak with the authority of moral righteousness on the one hand and the knife of oppression on the other they talk down to the struggle of peoples oppressed by white supremacy and attempt to steer it in a way that benefits their class interests white liberals despise the working class because they understand that there will come a day when it destroys the system that they profit so handsomely from
white liberals usually originate from the ruling class the managerial class and various stripes of the professionalized sector their class has ordained themselves the true leaders of human rights based on race gender and sexual equality however white liberals speak of human rights on the basis of a complete abandonment of the material struggle for liberation in other words the white liberal is the ultimate counterrevolutionary force in us society it has wielded the socalled struggle for human rights as a weapon to prevent the emergence of classconsciousness among the oppressed and its genuine leaders
the  elections have shown that the broad class arrangement of white liberals is indeed in crisis and only has itself to blame white liberals cannot acknowledge that it was their brand of politics that led to the trump moment their dominance over the left in the us ensured that no organized force existed strong enough to challenge the ills of capitalist decline millions of people voted for sanders based on his demands for material relief millions of people voted for trump for the similar reasons his racism and sexism notwithstanding whatever racism and sexism existed in his rhetoric could not trump the fact that the trade deals and wars he spoke out against in part drove ordinary people to vote for him if the trump base wanted racism and sexism primarily they would of voted for ted cruz or jeb bush in the primaries
so white liberal anger about trumps victory is not directed at sexism racism or any other aspect of trumps politics white liberals are afraid of the sharpening contradictions of us society that threaten to squeeze them out of their privileged position under the racist and capitalist order millions of people are now asking where white liberalism was during the massive loss in working class income and wealth that occurred over the last forty years where were the white liberals during the endless wars that have been waged even more fervently by democratic party administrations where were the white liberals during the erection of the largest police and prison state in the world the institutions that murder and incarcerate black americans in record numbers and deport undocumented peoples at historic rates
the answer is that white liberals were supporting the us capitalist systems assault on the oppressed every step of the way this is what they are trying to hide with their anger over trump we cannot defeat trumps white nationalism if the white liberal is not defeated with just as much vigor white liberal ideology has a history of infecting social movements as it spreads it breeds the germs of democratic party control over these movements but the democratic party made its own bed by acting as the more effective evil of the ruling class if a powerful movement of the working class is to emerge in the age of trump then we must fight hard against the white liberal forces working hard to resuscitate the democratic party and build an independent party of our own",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,3.528806933996037,8,2,7677,1306,4.873660030627871,1306.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,1.2430112677841747,1.2694362603963791,-0.2126399220120025,1.310712601322966,0.001531393568147,0.0,0.0,0,2,0.0,0.003793210737824,-0.9964,0.127,0.16,0.713,Negative,Very Strong

the cannabis party is calling on john key to explain why he gave over  million of new zealand taxpayers money to the clinton foundation

 october  

wikileaks raised serious ethical concerns about the clinton foundation when it published a hacked email send to clinton campaign chairman john podesta revealing blurred lines between the foundation and the personal financial interests of bill and hillary clinton 

cannabis party leader julian crawford said if john key was serious about hiv prevention one of the clinton foundations supposed goals he should legalise medical cannabis in new zealand 

hundreds of researchers have reported that thc was able to destroy the riv virus in monkeys that virus is nearly identical to the hiv virus found in humans he said 

john key has a lot of explaining to do if the wikileaks revelations about the clinton foundation are true 

former assistant director of the fbi thomas fuentes confirmed that the fbi has an intensive investigation ongoing into the clinton foundation 

new zealands national business review has reported that john key will continue giving millions of dollars of taxpayers money to the foundation in the future despite the criminal investigation of hillary clinton 

ive met her on lots of occasions had dinner with her at premier house a few times john key said 

as secretary of state she was great very engaged with new zealand broadcaster duncan garner yesterday raised serious concerns about the ongoing payments to the clinton foundation known as paytoplay 

we also give money to the clinton foundation yes we did gosh who didnt get a handout garner said

No Author,i dont rent to n s smoking gun proves trump family racism video  addicting info  the knowledge you crave,"on november    pm  
gop presidential nominee donald trump has taken a ridiculously hardline  and even bigoted  stance on immigration he has promised to build a wall and force mexico to pay for it and he has said that he will erect deportation forces to root out and get rid of all people in the united states without proper documentation well as we already knew it turns out that the donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one 
according to the associated press  it turns out that donald trumps wife melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the united states when she first arrived from her native slovenia melania often modeled using just her first name and was first granted entry into the country on a visitors visa known as a bb visa this occurred on august   melania did not get a legal work visa until october   during the time when she was prohibited from working in the country melania made money on ten different modeling assignments totaling upwards of  she got a green card in  and became a naturalized citizen in  
so in other words melania trump lied about her immigration story as recently as thursday when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go and that this is how she did it melania said in part in her stump speech 
as a young entrepreneur i wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance so of course i came here living and working in america was a true blessing but i wanted something more i wanted to be an american 
well it appears that as has long been suspected that melania trump wasnt as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims the information obtained by the ap include but are not limited to her contract from metropolitan international management  a modeling agency also theres the ledgers from the agency which is no longer in business that shows melania working during the time when she had the visitors visa but no work visa it seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up melanias wrongdoing but it is certainly quite interesting this would be why melania trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the united states and her eventual path to citizenship while it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud you can read more here at the associated press  
the long and short of it is this donald trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the other namely immigrants that is the height of hypocrisy seeing as how his own wife didnt completely comply with immigration law hopefully this story and the many other lies and coverups and shady dealings surrounding the trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time

David Rives,yes creationists can be real scientists too,"print 
when judith gait met father x it was a lopsided grief that drew them together he had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago gait is a married mother of five and longterm american resident in britain her support of the prolife movement is driven by thankfulness and praise for life and her christian faith 
witnessing abortions heavy toll on the living and dead gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing subtle and working entirely with symbolism these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion rather they mourn in color symbol and tone with single shoes broken cord dead flowers and other lonely and broken things troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x 
when a friend first visited gaits studio he was struck by her abortion paintings confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child he wrote i realize your work comes from a place of great love for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture 
gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child it happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby five years to the day father x remembers every detail 
their conversation grew into a joint effort culminating in a book  troubadours sailing hibiscus seas meditations on post abortion trauma  father x wanted to remain anonymous as a placesetter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion he wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of gaits  paintings in this book which have also been shown together in art exhibits 
time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion gait claims rather the past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence guilt and remorse has not abated you can see that in the words of father x which run the gamut of human emotions on abortion shoe pot and crossesfrom troubadours sailing hibiscus seas 
jonah of nineveh features an upended single rose with red cords and funereal foliage flowers are already in the birth position head down and waiting to be born torn and shroudlike ribbons hang across the painting spirals represent a childs dna helix and the veil of the temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation father x makes an analogy between jonah fleeing parental responsibility and eventual redemption  then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness it was her wedding dress my sea green empress this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives she was full of fear  
in some of these works hammers incongruently hang with flowers they are bloody or blackened some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose father x interprets these tools as decision markers to either build or tear down in hammer of decision it belongs to thor the war god infested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction wagner the olympics sperm races thomas moore and valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author either the carpenters hammer of wisdom or thors tool of chaos will be chosen by expectant parents hammer suspended 
 troubadours  runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities this includes moonlighting for angels celestial games interstellar windjammers and a baby steamer sailing on childrens seas among other delightful prospects lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their limbos 
father x occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters these are not theological statements but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion 
in gaits pink rose and stardust we see empty fields withered plants and other tokens father x takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children he places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles which is reflected in the painting children are disfigured or missing eyes or arms and singing in low mournful tones so as not to disturb their parents music is intense equivalent to the sound created by hildegard von bingen a thcentury nun and composer troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x 
references to mary as a mother are common as well as other scriptural allusions all babies jump for jesus in the womb or in its sack of nibbling yoke writes father x elizabeths child john leapt for joy just as his ancestor david did before the ark of the covenant he continues 
gait addresses the human embryo finding biblical ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages her abbey target beginning has a crosshair target which is interpreted spiritually the first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread  the bread on fire with the holy spirit the same stage of development as the child in marys womb when she arrived at her cousin elizabeths house 
postabort guilt isnt rationalized or downplayed but emotionally reacted to in art and word father x describes bats as whirling about in circles at the pitiful sound the aborted children make because they are tuned to such distressing signals this contrasts with many parents who are still stone deaf to such mournful sounds at another point fatherx imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus a roar of unwanted thoughts troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x 
father x elaborates on what gait hints in her paintings the injustice and evil of abortion he cites a world built on slavery before christs advent and the works of such men as william wilberforce and john brown in furthering christs gospel of justice and peace all this is contrasted to abortion throughout 
ruminating on gaits palms of our lord father x claims the face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion palms is murky with a single red hand print to look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the tarot of ruins he continues 
suicide advances this dark theme where gait and father x criticize the death industry and its euphemistically named clinics he takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings  a caricature of a woman who made a mistake who got herself in trouble who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart 
but all isnt baleful and sad here in cloud children father x muses on paper dolls in gaits paintings with this lovely thought where children go  is a mystery  some say they take their daytime rest in christs tomb in jerusalem and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled star ships 
 troubadours sailing hibiscus seas  is a work of meditation grief counseling poetry social commentary and visual art father x may not reveal his identity here but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child gait and father x describe their efforts as a silent prayer of witness for all the ghost families those phantoms of sorrows who will never laugh or cry together as a family because of an abortion they hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way 
judith gait is a graduate of california college of arts and crafts and received a masters at oxfords ruskin school of fine drawing her work is in public and private collections in america and abroad she is an american citizen residing in britain father x is an addictions counselor and writer in great britain who prefers to remain anonymous

Paul Joseph Watson,wikileaks email hillary campaign struggles to reach fking dumb young people,"clinton insider rigging only way hillary can win shes going to lose and she knows it he said jamie white  infowarscom  october   comments 
hillary clinton and the democrats have begun stealing the election using every underhanded tactic because its the only way she can win says clinton insider larry nichols 
shes going to lose and she knows it nichols said on the alex jones show thursday unless she can amass and pull off the biggest amount of voter fraud in the history of this country 
nichols explained that the establishment is already doing what it can to prevent an open and transparent election 
the dnc filed a lawsuit to try to force the removal of poll watchers at the polls he said why would they do that if they know theres no cheating going on why would they fight the voter id if they dont plan to have massive voter fraud 
the mainstream media and the clinton campaign are also doing everything they can up until election day to make everybody believe that the election is already over in hillarys favor nichols said 
folks do not believe it he said the polling is a part of this game plan to destroy your confidence in your ability to win 
i believe donald trump is winning nichols added youre winning youve just got to stay the course 
nichols warned that voters must take extra steps to ensure their vote isnt being altered 
youve got to make people at the precinct prove that your vote was recorded properly he said if they cant show you proof then demand a paper ballot

No Author,obama slams trumps rigged election claims as dangerous,"email 
leading republican presidential hopeful suggests israelipalestinian peace accord may be impossible sometimes agreements cant be madeafter being asked by a voter at a charleston south carolina town hall event hosted by msnbc about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict the gop contender vowed to give it one hell of a shot and called it probably the toughest agreement of any kind to makebut when pressed by host joe scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either israelis or palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord trump declined to take sides 
you know i dont want to get into it because  if i win i dont want to be in a position where im saying to you and the other side now says we dont want trump involved trump said 
let me be sort of a neutral guy he continued a lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal so i dont want to say whose fault is it i dont think it helpstrump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a twostate solution given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time 
its possible its not makeable because dont forget it has to last  its wonderful to make it and it doesnt work but it has to last he said to make lasting peace there probably the toughest deal of all but im going to give it a shot 
though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate and what he considers the root of the conflict 
a lot of people say an agreement cant be made which is okay i mean sometimes agreements cant be made not good but you know you have both sides really but one side in particular growing up and learning that these are the worst people he said i was with a very prominent israeli the other day he says its impossible because the other side has been trained from the time theyre children to hate jewish peoplein the past trump has questioned israels commitment to peace while at the same time suggesting the jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the palestinians he has also called prime minister benjamin netanyahu a good friend 
at a presidential candidates forum hosted by the republican jewish coalition in december  the real estate magnate said i dont know that israel has the commitment to make it and i dont know that the other side has the commitment to make it 
he made the same point in an interview with ap earlier that day a lot will have to do with israel and whether or not israel wants to make the deal  whether or not israels willing to sacrifice certain things he said they may not be and i understand that and im okay with that but then youre just not going to have a deal

admin,dying out wild animal numbers could fall by  from  study says,"a subject not often discussed is the topic of how to repair strained or broken relationships it is one that comes up in everyones life so it will be useful to make a few suggestions about it here we will talk about relationships from friends family and lovers
relationships among friends we will treat first the first step in this process is to make an evaluation to determine whether the relationship is worth saving or rehabilitating it is a simple fact of life that some relationships have an expiration date when two people no longer have anything in common or their paths take them in divergent directions it may be difficult to find common ground in this situation it is always better to let the relationship die a natural death slowly rather than rapidly abrupt terminations may leave the other party with negative feelings and this should be avoided if at all possible
there are some instances where repair is not possible when someone has committed a fundamental violation of trust or respect this is a warning sign that the person was never a friend in the first place another point to keep in mind is that repair of a broken relationship requiresno demandsthe participation of both parties if the other person is unwilling to participate in the process then your efforts will be futile and will come to nothing

once we have determined that the friendship is worth repairing or sustaining the next step is to decide how to make the first approach to the other party in this we must try to evaluate the reasons for the problems in the first place we should make an honest assessment about how things got to where they are did someone say or do something that caused hard feelings on the other side was there some intervening cause that made the two parties diverge in plans and activities these types of questions must be honestly and repeatedly asked we have a tendency to minimize our own hurtful actions and exaggerate those of others and this must be kept in mind
the key rule at this point is to try to put ourselves in the shoes of the other party we must try to see things from our friends perspective for many people this can be difficult as it involves getting past our own feelings of hurt or rejection and into the shoes of the other person and yet it is essential very frequently the reasons for strained or broken friendships lies in the fact that there is some problem going on in the other persons life only by being a perceptive student of human nature can we divine the cause sometimes the only thing that caused the strained relationship was some misunderstanding that was easily curable
keep in mind that we must tryat least in our own mindsto discover the source of the other persons problem this is not always possible as human beings are not always rational but we can at least make the effort i remember in the film hoffa that there was a great line from jack nicholson he told one of his men real problems real grievances can be resolved they can be negotiated but imaginary grievances that man is going to hate you for life i have no idea if jimmy hoffa every actually said this but it sounds like something he would have said he meant that we should avoid hurting the pride of our friends we should be acutely aware how it is sometimes the intangible slights that can most rankle with a man
when you have decided to make the first step it is always better to initiate contact directly do not wait for the other person to do it depending on the circumstances this should be done discreetly and without too much in the way of overpowering insistence there is a certain type of finesse that a man should have at critical times and this is one of them the approach should be direct but neither insistent nor demanding a fish is best hooked with a lure gently laid
of vital importance here is that the approach be sincere one should genuinely want to contact the other party sincerity is the glue that binds friendships together and permits their longevity there should be no hypocrisy or falsity in any of our dealings with friends this kind of thing is immediately apparent and once detected its whiff surrounds the offending party like a permanent cloud if the other party is receptive to the approach we can then gradually feel our way forward taking care to avoid the reasons why the friendship became strained in the first place things may never quite go back to what they were but at least we can find solid ground for a new frame of reference
two examples will suffice here the historian william shirer worked closely with famed correspondent edward r murrow when the two were in germany in the s yet after the war was over the two grew apart shirers account of the estrangement suggests that he was repelled by murrows enthusiastic adoption of the anticommunist hysteria of the time shirer found himself gradually blackballed from most major news networks before being forced out completely he broke with murrow over these events many decades later he approached murrow all venom spent the two were able to find common ground again

another example makes the same point theodore roosevelt was a strongwilled insistent man to say the least he was in a position to choose his successor as president and to this end he selected a man very different from him the affable and rotund william howard taft taft eventually began to find roosevelt an overbearing and unwelcome presence in his life the two men eventually broke completely a result of their personality differences and different conceptions of leadership to his credit roosevelt eventually approached his old friend privately to patch things up they were never the same of course but at least some cordiality was restored
relationships with family are of a fundamentally different sort because we are linked by bonds of blood or perhaps marriage it will be more difficult to disentangle ourselves from those with whom we have become estranged on the other hand it may be easier to repair such grievances or at least find common ground since there may be more shared experiences with the other party that act in our favor the key here is not to expect too much although shared history and common blood may work in our favor they can be counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that irrational family antagonisms can run deeper than those from strained friendships patience and persistence are most important here perhaps more so than friendships with those unrelated to us

repairing strained relationships with lovers is perhaps the most difficult when a man and woman have been united in the past through the coital act an entirely different set of emotions and motivations come into play relationships between lovers can fail or become strained for an infinite number of reasons and it would be impossible to discuss all of them here it is enough for me to state my opinion that it is nearly impossible to bring an intimate sexual relationship back to what it was after it has been broken
strained is one thing broken is quite another my own experience leads me to believe that once a sexual relationship is done it is done one cannot really go back to what it was before amicable dealings are certainly possible and happen all the time but i would not call this friendship i would call it an uneasy equilibrium loves inflammatory presence scorches all it leaves in its wake

today we are going to take a quick look at two epic clint eastwood films one of which is a wellknown western classic  the outlaw josey wales  the other one is a littleknown undertheradar gem which showcases the psychotic insanity of the deranged western female  play misty for me  
both of these superb rpo films will leave any redpill male feeling wholly satisfied shortly after viewing them and well thats what these movie reviews of your old uncle bobs are all about are they nothelping you find the bona fide gold nuggets amid the endlessly steaming piles of sjw hollywood crap yes indeed 
so lets get crackin  the outlaw josey wales   clint eastwood chief dan george bill mckinney john vernon 
clint eastwood directed and starred in this sweeping extremely wellcrafted postcivil war epic film and the cinematography and direction are undeniably excellent but eastwoods portrayal of the southernsympathizer josey wales who has a major score to settle after union troops burn his house down and murder his wife and children is in itself a major cinematic achievement 
out for blood and taking no prisoners eastwoods merciless josey wales thunders across the plains and prairies of the american west blowing scores of northern soldiers away in the process as he makes a desperate dash towards mexico and what he hopes will be sanctuary but wales gets sidetracked along the way collecting a stray dog and a few stray human beings as well which proves that the only thing a man can truly count on in this life is change 
theres a great scene early on in the film involving josey wales partner in crime jaimie played by sam bottoms where he starts babbling incoherently while faking a state of feverinduced delirium from underneath a blanket as the two outlaws are confronted by a pair of backwoods yahoos who are looking to collect the bounty that has recently been placed on wales head 
here we clearly see the behavior of the typical frightened woefully outmanned beta male as character actor len lesser who portrays the overmatched bounty hunter abe starts yapping and barking in a very loud voice while jerking around excitedly shortly after getting the drop on eastwoods alphamale killingmachine 
if youre an alpha male and youre in good shape youve undoubtedly seen similar betamale behavior probably at a bar when some paunchy beta asswit whos sitting with his cucked crew has had one too many beers and starts cutting you down in a passiveaggressive manner from your periphery as he barks and yaps in an excited voice about how tough he used to be or how he doesnt need to lift weights to be a man or how he doesnt think its cool to wear tight shorts a hostile barb born of envy uttered because he feels his package is inadequate yup you know the routine 
in the films wowwealmosthadagangbang scene featuring a somewhatturnedon sondra locke see above photo locke portrays kansasborn settler laura lee as shes confronted in the back of a covered wagon and dragged outside by a group of lusty comancheros which was obviously a blatant exaggeration because as we already know all rapes are committed by totally unattractive deranged horribly evil lightskinned men who smell badly and have absolutely zero neck tattoos e   etcclints character comes riding to the rescue out of the hills and guns the wouldbe rapists down which probably made sjws and feminists at the time scream with unbridled outrage at the theater screen she was giving her consent  didnt you see it  it was in her eyes  its her right to express herself sexually with however many men she might choose  murderer creeper pussyblocker  
unfortunately just like today there were feminists and sjws aplenty back in  their numbers have been growing with a vengeance since roughly the mids and after more than  years in the saddle they still keep going round and round in circles yelling preprogrammed buzzwords and catchphrases while unknowingly speeding up the destruction of freedom of speech but hey uncle bob tell us something we dont already know and yeah ill get back to the film review now 
my favorite scene in the movie occurs when josey wales who now that i think about it is a bit of a white knight hmm rescues a native american woman who is about to be doubleteamed against her will by a pair of drunken white trappers 
eastwoods maddog character ultimately gets the drop on the wouldbe bountycollectors and he blows them straight to hell in an impressive hail of gunfire which ill have to admit is pretty darned cool in itself i mean thats why we watch films like this isnt it  for the violence and the babes and the redpill messages well there are plenty of those to be had in this noholdsbarred epic western film 
maybe im going to have to rethink this movie in terms of it being perceived as a wholly redpill film clints character stepped up and stopped a potential gangbang as well as a threeway and nobody asked him to do it so this might have been a sly hollywood warmup for the series of blatant white knight films we see today but i dont really want to think that way about clint so i wont ill just gulp down a quick blue pill right nowah much better 
i mean clint played dirty harry callahan for chrissakes in a film that i will hopefully be reviewing at a later date if i dont get hit by a truck driven by an illegal alien whos sporting  arrests for murder while having no drivers license or lynched by a swarm of rabid sjws who are on the hunt for any white male who isnt a media ceo or a billionaire 
the film bogs down a bit after about the twothirds mark in my opinion but it still gets high marks across the board in every other critical category if you havent seen it rectify that soon you cant miss by watching this topdrawer rpo film for men  play misty for me   clint eastwood jessica walter donna mills 
unless they are overthetop laughingly ridiculous obviously fictional slasher films redpill movies like this one just dont get made in hollywood any longer 
when you think of clint eastwood you usually think of dirty harry  or the outlaw josey wales  or unforgiven  or gran torino but clint made a few obscure films that were both solidly red pill and truly excellent movies although theyve been swept under the rug and locked away in the film vaults by todays liberalleaning filmhiders 
in this welldirected highly suspenseful thriller carmelbythesea disk jockey dave carver clint eastwood lives a freewheeling alpha male lifestyle regularly banging out an assortment of hot women who listen to his live jazz broadcasts on a nightly basis carver is living the dream pounding most of the available hot babes and thoroughly enjoying his rightfully appointed alpha male privilege or is that white male privilegeersjw moment there sorry 
that is until jessica walters psychostalker character evelyn walks into his life 
now you may have encountered a few of these yourself or maybe its just me sometimes i think i have an invisible sign on my forehead that only the initiated can read which proclaims if youre hot and insaneim your guy but clint eastwood shows us exactly what its like to be pursed by an attractive psycho female stalker from writing creepy notes to him in lipstick on his mirror to cutting up his clothing to attacking his cleaning lady in a fit of jealous rage clints diskjockey character quickly begins to realize that he bit off a hell of a lot more than just pussy when he started banging actress jessica walters batshitcrazy evelyn 
ive always had a feeling that actresses who were really good in these psycho roles were just being themselves but i could be wrong about that i was wrong once beforeit was in the third grade and she didnt really love me be that as it may jessica walters really brings her agame in the role of the totally unhinged evelyn if youve ever had a relationship with a woman like this one watching the film will send chills down your spine and result in some serious flashback imagery 
have you ever done thiswhat clint is doing in the above photonamely hold and comfort a crazy woman who somehow managed to weasel her way into your life by skillfully turning you into both an enabler and a caretakerif so i definitely feel your pain and ill bet clint has experienced it a time or three himself or he probably wouldnt have done this film 
play misty for me is absolutely worth watching for myriad reasons but the most important reason of all i wholeheartedly believe is because it will clearly demonstrate to you in no uncertain terms the subtle and overt signs that a man absolutely has to be able to recognize in order to avoid being blindsided by a psychotic unhinged female and for that reason alone its a mustsee classic no doubt about it when clints character ultimately gets revenge on his tormentor at the very end of this excellent rpo film youll feel all warm and fuzzy inside tooand in a weird viscerally satisfying waywhich makes the whole experience just that much more gratifying 
by boycotting all modern sjw hollywood cinema you are sending a message to the power structure that is loud and clearyou are not being fooled by their deliberate attempts to poison peoples minds and socially engineer them to be pussified dumbeddown bluepillsucking robots 
always research the plot lines of any films for which you are seriously considering buying a ticket or renting on dvd and if you smell an sjw rat dont spend your money its that simple in the end its just like investigating a potential ltr candidate you have to conduct your due diligence otherwise you might just get taken for a ride",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,82.22642928926737,64,12,9945,1745,4.669914040114613,1745.0,0.062397119602861,0.3616742515005802,1.843059814251706,1.9576481272343869,-0.4137172331464793,2.015014591640888,0.0051575931232091,0.0,0.0005730659025787,0,1,0.0,0.0084918420277181,-0.996,0.111,0.135,0.754,Negative,Very Strong

Bob Unruh,see dems accept foreign cash to disrupt trump rallies,"print saeed toosi right and ayatollah khamenei 
after failed attempts by top iran officials to cover up the scandal the nations leading reciter of the quran and close friend of ayatollah khamenei has been accused of raping  of his students and charged with advocating corruption 
saeed toosi  winner of the first prize for reading the quran both internationally and locally fell under suspicion after a broadcast by persian voice of america  banned for viewing by tehran  in which three alleged rape victims came forward with written and audio evidence and described sexual assaults by toosi reported al arabiya 
in an audio recording toosi said that khamenei knew of the sexual assaults and together with the head of irans judicial authority had agreed to a coverup to protect the reputation of the nations quranic institution and the regime 
its time to stop tiptoeing around the facts the politically incorrect guide to islam and the crusades is a muchneeded dose of truth about the religion of peace 
one document has toosi admitting that his actions with his students had been a mistake one of the victims  a recent firstplace winner in a quranic competition  claimed he was raped when he was  while traveling abroad with toosi to attend a competition the mentor according to the charge booked the pair in a single hotel room where the attack took place 
all victims who have filed statements were between  and  at the time of the alleged attacks the incidents took place over the past seven years during quranic trips to more than  countries in the world aimed at spreading the quranic culture and to participate in quranic competitions 
toosi is highly respected as irans most celebrated reader of the quran and was previously called an exemplary model to be followed by khamenei current supreme leader of iran he is a permanent guest of khamenei in the annual quranic councils celebrated during ramadan last may toosi was asked to recite verses from the quran at the opening session of the shura council with many of irans top officials in attendance 
the students told persian voa they had filed charges with the house of leadership but officials dismissed their claims citing a repentance letter from toosi admitting his actions and claiming to be a changed man 
while iran officially imposes the death penalty for homosexuality sex between men and boys is viewed with some toleration in the culture causing confusion as to whether the resulting relationships are consensual or forced the case is further complicated by the fact allegations of sexual misconduct against powerful officials are unheard of in the islamic republic 
according to the reformist amad news officials held a twohour emergency meeting with the judiciary following outcries over the broadcast the initial intent to bury the story failed after it reached the national press and resulted in toosi now being charged 
judiciary chief ayatollah sadeq larijani whom the victims audio showed conspiring with khamenei to cover up the incidents defended the regimes handling of the case london guardian reported larijani called for punishment of those who cooperated with hostile media in the voa story so we know who is loyal to the revolution and who is not 
the case has been given to a judge for a ruling though there will be no public trial awad news reports members of the army of the guardians of the islamic revolution are planning to assassinate toosi to end the scandal and save the regimes reputation

Arch Stanton,christ and the sufi  a parable of perfection,"part   the six stages of the exorcism process by lobro van helsing part  of this article is authored entirely by lobro van helsing and consists largely of graphic details about the exorcism process as described by malachi martin in his controversial book hostage to the devil  part  of the article entitled the deceiver of the world is by lasha darkmoon and continues where part  leaves off this reflects on various apocalyptic issues such as armageddon and the last days the problem of good and evil and the role of the jews in human history 
the devils finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist  charles baudelaire 
why is it so hard to accept at least hypothetically that in the words of observant thinkers like baudelaire the devils finest trick is to convince us that he does not exist 
it is generally accepted that the devil preys on human souls and what do predators do in all the settings natural political online they all use disguise and it shouldnt be beyond comprehension that the devil if he existed would use whichever cloak of invisibility was the most effective for the occasion therefore not seeing the devil or sensing his presence proves absolutely nothing 
for those who are interested the material here comes from a book hostage to the devil  by father malachi martin a trained exorcist in the roman catholic tradition 
fr malachis material featuring several cases of authentic demonic possession and their accompanying exorcisms in modern day america was carefully vetted through use of tape recorders and reinforced later on by lengthy interviews with the participants in the exorcism process    
in  in south africa  clara germana cele age  reportedly made a pact with the devil as a result her behavior suddenly took a bizarre turn for the worse in august of that year the startled nuns at the convent school where clara was a student witnessed her tearing at her clothes growling like an animal and engaging in conversation with unseen entities 
nuns reported that the girls skin would burn when sprinkled with holy water she would lash out violently when crosses or other sacred objects entered her presenceshe also reportedly developed clairvoyant powers and was able to describe personal details of other peoples lives that she couldnt possibly have known ab out 
the accounts of several nuns also reported that clara possessed the ability to speak and understand several different foreign languages to which she had never been exposed including polish german french and several others it was said that clara had been imbued with superhuman strength as well easily overpowering authority figures at the school when they attempted to restrain her 
another seemingly farfetched assertion from many witnesses was that clara began levitating up to five feet in the air on a regular basis her clothes sticking to her body as if they too had managed to defy the laws of gravity it was claimed that only after being sprinkled with holy water could she be brought back down during which time she would also temporarily snap out of her possessed state 
most outlandish of all were the claims that the young woman had the ability to transform into a sort of snakelike creature her body becoming as flexible as rubber as she slithered across the floor at one point she was said to have bitten a nun on the arm and left puncture marks like those of a serpents fangs 
see here  
note this case history is not to be found in malachi martins hostage to the devil i have added it to the article as an afterthought since it contains within it many of the typical features found in demonic possession before you read any further please watch this minute video in spanish with english subtitles warning this article contains material that is deeply disturbing those of sensitive disposition are advised to refrain from further reading 
apart from the quoted extracts randomly chosen among many to illustrate various aspect of possession or exorcism i wish to make the following points although the book deals only with cases in the catholic community demonic possession is a universal phenomenon and has been noted and researched in countries all over the world the possessor often referring to itself as the kingdom or in plural as we selects victims gripped in some spiritual emotional and intellectual conflict with the accepted mores of family society and church inserting itself undetected into these fault lines and exploiting them with catastrophic consequences loss of self identity soul or personality follows as a result there is invariably an element of guilt on the part of the victim who has initially invited possession by his or her aberrant behavior and life style in extreme cases the possessed individual has actually made a formal request for possession in order to gain some advantage eg worldly wealth or fame the process of expelling the possessing malignancy moves through identifiable stages 
one of the most experienced exorcists i have known malachi martin notes who was in fact the mentor of the exorcist in the first case related in this book gave names to the various general stages of an exorcism these names reflect the general meaning or effect or intent of what is happening but not the specific means used by the evil spirit or by the exorcist conor as i call him spoke of six stages presence pretense breakpoint voice clash and expulsion  exorcism exacts practically intolerable toll on the priest in charge not infrequently resulting in his death at which point the junior helper must take over the task demonic possession is not an isolated or freak phenomenon it seems to be on the rise especially in the united states perhaps this has something to do with the demise of religious authority the proliferation of satanist covens child abuse and sacrifice the prevalence and glorification of satanist elements in pop culture and finally the wide acceptance and promotion of sexual perversion as a new norm 
the incidence of exorcism fr martin begins by pointing out has been on a steady rise there has been a  percent increase in the number of exorcisms performed between the early s and the mids over the same period there has been an alarming increase in the number of requested possessions  that is cases in which the possessed formally request satan to possess them  in comparison to the cases of incurred possessions which result from other sorts of activities of the possessed that facilitate possession 
each year some  to  major exorcisms and some thousands of minor exorcisms are performed for experts in the field this is a sobering barometer of the increase in known cases of possession but it is still more sobering to realize how many more cases of possession cannot be addressed at all the thousands of letters i receive from people who are desperate for help  catholic protestant evangelical and unchurched  are eloquent anguished and a steadily mounting testimony to the crisis 
law officers meanwhile are increasingly confronted on every side by the incontrovertible signs of crimes committed in the course of ritualistic satanism or as a grisly result of an individuals participation in such rituals they are very often left out of the shrunken loop of expert advice and assistance advice and assistance that was once routinely to be found 
to those who are active in the field of exorcism and who therefore acquire a greater than usual ability to uncover and recognize the marks of ritualistic satanism for what they are it is clear that in many police precincts the satanist character of a crime is either relegated to the background or not mentioned at all  at least not in public reports 
by and large the police have no other choice they have neither competence nor authority in the rarefied and dangerous field of satanist behavior most of the above points were made on numerous occasions in mythology and folklore eg vampires werewolves and the tale of dr faustus adapted by marlowe and goethe jesus christ was of course the grand exorcist not only in the gadarene swine incident but his opus seems to me to have been focused on confronting the devil in judaism for which he paid with his life  the tale does not end there in my view but i leave these speculative elements to the reader    the six stages of demonic possession 
from the moment the exorcist enters the room a peculiar feeling seems to hang in the very air from that moment in any genuine exorcism and onward through its duration everyone in the room is aware of some alien presence  this indubitable sign of possession is as unexplainable and unmistakable as it is inescapable all the signs of possession however blatant or grotesque however subtle or debatable seem both to pale before and to be marshaled in the face of this presence 
there is no sure physical trace of the presence but everyone feels it you have to experience it to know it you cannot locate it spatially beside or above or within the possessed or over in the corner or under the bed or hovering in midair 
in one sense the presence is nowhere and this magnifies the terror because there is a presence an other present not a he or a she or an it sometimes you think that what is present is singular sometimes plural when it speaks as the exorcism goes on it will sometimes refer to itself as i and sometimes as we 
this is reminiscent of the possessing entity in the gospel who when asked his name by jesus replied i am legion i am legion 
invisible and intangible the presence claws at the humanness of those gathered in the room you can exercise logic and expel any mental image of it you can say to yourself i am only imagining this careful dont panic and there may be a momentary relief but then after a time lag of bare seconds the presence returns as an inaudible hiss in the brain as a wordless threat to the self you are its name and essence seem to be compounded of threat to be only and intensely baleful concentratedly intent on hate for hates sake and on destruction for destructions sake    
in the early stages of an exorcism  the evil spirit will make every attempt to hide behind the possessed so to speakto appear to be one and the same person and personality with its victim this is the pretense  
the first task of the priest is to break that pretense to force the spirit to reveal itself openly as separate from the possessedand to name itself for all possessing spirits are called by a name that generally though not always has to do with the way that spirit works on its victim 
as the exorcist sets about his task the evil spirit may remain silent altogether or it may speak with the voice of the possessed and use past experiences and recollections of the possessed this is often done skillfully using details no one but the possessed could know it can be very disarming even pitiful it can make everyone including the priest feel that it is the priest who is the villain subjecting an innocent person to terrible rigors even the mannerisms and characteristics of the possessed are used by the spirit as its own camouflage 
sometimes the exorcist cannot shatter the pretense for days but until he does he cannot bring matters to a head if he fails to shatter it at all he has lost perhaps another exorcist replacing him will succeed but he himself has been beaten every exorcist learns during pretense that he is dealing with some force or power that is at times intensely cunning sometimes supremely intelligent and at other times capable of crass stupidity which makes one wonder further about the problem of singular or plural and it is both highly dangerous and terribly vulnerable 
oddly while this spirit or power or force knows some of the most secret and intimate details of the lives of everyone in the room at the same time it also displays gaps in knowledge of things that may be happening at any given moment of the present 
but the priest must not be lulled by small victories or take chances on hopedfor stupidities he must be ready to have his own sins and blunders and weaknesses put into his mind or shouted in ugliness for all to hear he must not make excuses for his past or wither as even his loveliest memories are fingered by ultimate filth and contempt he must not be sidetracked in any way from his primary intention of freeing the possessed person before him and he must at all costs avoid trading abuse or getting into any logical arguments with the possessed the temptation to do so is more frequent than one might think and must be regarded as a potentially fatal trap that can shatter not only the exorcism but quite literally shatter the exorcist as well 
accordingly as the pretense begins to break down the behavior of the possessed usually increases in violence and repulsiveness it is as though an invisible manhole opens and out of it pours the unmentionably inhuman and the humanly unacceptable there is a stream of filth and unrestrained abuse accompanied often by physical violence writhing gnashing of teeth jumping around sometimes physical attacks on the exorcist    
a new hallmark of the proceedings enters as the breakpoint nears and ushers in one of the more subtle sufferings the exorcist must undergo confusion complete and dreadful confusion rare is the exorcist who does not falter here for at least a moment enmeshed in the peculiar pain of apparent contradiction of all sense 
his ears seem to smell foul words his eyes seem to hear offensive sounds and obscene screams his nose seems to taste a highdecibel cacophony each sense seems to be recording what another sense should be recording each nerve and sinew of onlookers and participants becomes rigid as they strive for control panicthe fear of being dissolved into insanityruns in quick jabs through everyone there all present experience this increasingly violent and confusing assault but the exorcist is the one who rides the storm he is the direct target of it all 
the breakpoint is reached at that moment when the pretense has finally collapsed altogether the voice of the possessed is no longer used by the spirit though the new strange voice may or may not issue from the mouth of the victim in thomas wus case the alien voice did come from the possesseds mouth and that was why the police captain was so startled the sound produced is often not even remotely like any human sound 
at the breakpoint for the first time the spirit speaks of the possessed in the third person as a separate being for the first time the possessing spirit acts personally and speaks of i or we usually interchangeably and of my and our or mine and ours 
another very frequent sign that the breakpoint has been reached is the appearance of what father conor called the voice  
the voice is an inordinately disturbing and humanly distressing babel the first few syllables seem to be those of some word pronounced slowly and thicklysomewhat like a tape recording played at a subnormal speed you are just straining to pick up the word and a layer of cold fear has already gripped youyou know this sound is alien but your concentration is shattered and frustrated by an immediate gamut of echoes of tiny prickly voices echoing each syllable screaming it whispering it laughing it sneering it groaning it following it they all hit your ear while the alien voice is going on unhurriedly to the next syllable which you then try to catch while guessing at the first one you lost by then the tiny jabbing voices have caught up with that second syllable and the voice has proceeded to the third syllable and so on 
if the exorcism is to proceed the voice must be silenced it takes an enormous effort of will on the part of the exorcist in direct confrontation with the alien will of evil to silence the voice the priest must get himself under control and challenge the spirit first to silence and then to identify itself intelligibly 
as in all things to do with exorcism of evil spirit the priest makes this challenge with his own will but always in the name and by the authority of jesus and his church to do so in his own name or by some fancied authority of his own would be to invite personal disaster merely human power unadorned and without aid cannot cope with the preternatural it is to be remembered that when we speak of the preternatural we are not speaking about what are known as poltergeists 
usually at this point and as the voice dies out a tremendous pressure of an obscure kind affects the exorcist this is the first and outermost edge of a direct and personal collision with the will of the kingdom the clash  
we all know from our personal experience that there can be no struggle of single personal wills without that felt and intuitive contact between two persons there is a twoway communication that is as real as a conversation using words the clash is the heart of a special and dreadful communication the nucleus of this singular battle of wills between exorcist and evil spirit    
painful as it will be for him the priest must look for the clash he must provoke it if he cannot lock wills with the evil thing and force that thing to lock its will in opposition to his own then again the exorcist is defeated 
the issue between the two the exorcist and the possessing spirit is simple will the totally antihuman invade and take over will it noisome and merciless seep over that narrow rim where the exorcist would hold his ground alone and engulf him or will it unwillingly protestingly under a duress greater than its singletrack will stop identify itself cede retire disappear and be volatilized back into an unknown pit of being where no man wants to go ever 
even with all the pressure on him and in fullest human agony if the exorcist has got this far he must press home he has gained an advantage he has already forced the evil spirit to come out on its own if he has not been able to until now he must finally force it to give its name and then some exorcists feel the exorcist must pursue for as much information as he can for in some peculiar way as exorcists find the more an evil spirit can be forced to reveal in the clash and its aftermath the surer and easier will be the expulsion when that moment comes to force as complete an identification as possible is perhaps a mark of domination of one will over another 
it is of crucial interest to speculate about the violence provoked by exorcismthe physical and mental struggles that are so extreme they can bring on death why would spirit battle so why not leave and waft off invisibly to someone or someplace else for spirit itself seems to suffer in these battles 
time and again in exorcism after exorcism there occurs that curious thing to do with spirit and place the strange puzzle mentioned previously in connection with the room chosen for the exorcism when jesus expelled the unclean spirits those spirits showed concern for where they might go in record after record as well as in several exorcisms recounted in this book the possessing spirits wail in lament and questioning pain where shall we gowe too have to possess our habitationeven the anointed one gave us a place with the swinehere    we cant stay here any longer 
evil spirit having found a home with a consenting host does not appear to give up its place easily it claws and fights and deceives and even risks killing its host before it will be expelled how violent the struggle probably depends on many things the intelligence of the spirit being dealt with and the degree of possession achieved over the victim are perhaps two one could speculate about 
whatever determines the actual pitch of violence once the exorcist has forced the invading spirit to identify itself and sustained the first wordless bout of the clash and then invoked its formal condemnation and expulsion by the exorcism rite the immediate result is generally a struggle tortuous beyondimagining an open violence that leaves all subtlety behind 
the person possessed is by now obviously aware in one way or another of what possessed him frequently he becomes a true battleground for much of the remainder of the exorcism enduring unbelievable punishment and strain 
it is sometimes possible for the exorcist to appeal directly to the possessed person urging him to use some part of his own will still free of the spirits influence and control and engage directly in the fight aiding the exorcist and at such moments no animal pinned helplessly to the ground struggles more pathetically against the drinking of its lifes blood by a voracious and superior cruelty the very nauseous character of the possessed persons appearance and behavior appears to be a sign of his desire for deliverance a desperate sign of struggle evidence of a revolt where once he had consented 
increasingly what had possessed him is being forced into the open all the while protesting its victims revolt and its own expulsion the violence of the contortions and the physical disfigurement of the possessed can reach a degree one would think he could not possibly withstand 
the exorcist too comes in for full attack now once cornered the evil spirit seems able to call on a superior intelligence and will try to lure the exorcist on to a field boobytrapped and mined with situations from which no human can extricate himself 
any weakness in the religious faith that alone sustains the exorcist or any fatigue will allow the exorcists mind to be flooded with a terrible light he cannot fend offa light that can burn the very roots of his reason and turn him emotionally into the most servile of slaves desperate to be liberated from all bodily life 
these are only some of the dangers and traps that face every exorcist his pain is physical emotional mental he has to deal with what is eerie but not enthralling with something askew but intelligently so with a quality that is upside down and inside out but significantly so the mordant traits of nightmare are there in full regalia but this is no dream and permits him no thankful remission 
he is attacked by a stench so powerful that many exorcists start vomiting uncontrollably he is made to bear physical pain and he feels anguish over his very soul he is made to know he is touching the completely unclean the totally unhuman  the totally unhuman  click to expand  
all sense may suddenly seem nonsense hopelessness is confirmed as the only hope death and cruelty and contempt are normal anything comely or beautiful is an illusion nothing it seems was ever right in the world of man here is an atmosphere as bizarre as bedlam 
if in spite of his emotions and his imagination and his bodyall trapped at once in pain and anguishif in spite of all this the will of the exorcist holds in the clash what he does is to approach his final function in this situation as an authorized human witness for jesus 
by no power of his on account of no privilege of his own he calls finally on the evil spirit to desist to be dispossessed to depart  and to leave the person possessed 
and if the exorcism is successful this is what happens the possession ends 
all present become aware of a change around them the sense of presence is totally suddenly absent 
sometimes there are receding voices or other noises sometimes only dead silence 
the recently possessed will wake up as if from a dream a nightmare a coma sometimes he will remember much of what he has been through sometimes he will remember nothing at all    many people could be demonically possessed without knowing it here are two individuals who in my opinion might benefit from the ministrations of a good exorcist is this woman demonically possessed who knows    but many have said so click here for a spooky minute video is this woman demonically possessed who knows    but many have thought so apart from the demonic expression that disfigures her face this woman preaches white genocidethe total destruction of the european race what more do you have to do to qualify for demonic possession see here for more details on barbara spectres psychopathy and compare the expression on her face with figure  of this illustration from a medical textbook on demonic possession   as i wrote in a recent email to lasha darkmoon i feel that the entire tribe of judah is demonically possessed they always have been for centuries jesus made that point over and over again in his homilies and clearly the jews works bear that out they are now the devils agents on earth to promote his policies and spread contagion into the body of the goyim history bears me out on this 
i will not quote dr darkmoons response here it is too long and would require a separate article of its own suffice to say that she disagreed with me on several counts though she accepted my general premise that demonic possession was an authentic and veridical phenomenon and not just a superstitious relic of the dark ages continued in part  the deceiver of the world  by lasha darkmoon

Roosh Valizadeh,how hedonistic game became the gateway to virtuous truths,"peter the great  was one of the pivotal figures of russian history his reforms were a product of his personality and his vision for what he wanted russia to become and sometimes in history personality matters more than those vague historical forces that professional historians like to imagine as controlling the destinies of men
russia in his day was still halfbarbarous to rule her he had to be an absolute monarch and never for a moment doubted his right to be so his personal habits say much about him he had little need for sleep regularly working for fourteen hours or more per day alcohol was considered then as now an acceptable escape from the drudgery of rule but he knew when to limit his intake and forbade his ministers from excessive consumption his sexual appetites were as normal as any mans but he showed little interest in the kind of conspicuous indulgence that characterized most of his contemporaries in western europe
he did make a point of choosing mistresses of lowly origin rather than from titled families he had no desire for intellectual competition in the bedroom when frederick ii of denmark teased him about the type of women he chose his response was brother my women do not cost me much but yours cost you thousands of crowns which might be better spent elsewhere

he chose to spend most of his time in the city that bore his name st petersburg he liked maritime affairs and wanted to be near the sea he disliked the atmosphere of moscow with its abundance of clergy and freezing winters it was the army that first felt the effect of his modernization programs peter introduced conscription a professional officer class and defined periods of service his naval program was less effective and most of the vessels built during his reign were not of high quality
he realized that he would never be able to make russia into a great power unless he changed the mentality and outlook of the people and like many rulers before and after him he underestimated just how difficult this task would prove to be after his death many of his reforms were permitted to wither on the vine but at least some tentative first steps had been made that future monarchs might draw inspiration from by imperial decree he banished beards in  an exception was made for the orthodox patriarch this was a shocking step in a country where whiskers had become a symbol of piety and fidelity those who insisted on keeping them could do so by paying an incomeadjusted annual tax we are told that some distraught peasants obsessively saved their shaved facial hair lest they incur some disfavor from the saints
but there was method to peters apparent madness he understood that appearance and thought are connected and that if a man wished to change one he had to change the other in  peter decreed that all royal officials had to adopt westernstyle clothing trousers and cloaks were acceptable caftans or overly oriental garb was not like kemal ataturk two centuries later he had no patience for backsliders or protesters whom he swept aside ruthlessly in social relations he ended for good the traditional practice of secluding women from public intercourse with men a habit that had probably been an inheritance from the mongols
these reforms gained peter some bitter enemies among the clergy for centuries the russian ecclesiastic establishment had held a near monopoly on education and rural social life peters reforms threatened to erode this base and they saw in him an implacable enemy of traditional belief they also suspected him of having had too much contact with western europeans a fact thatit seemed to themmade him nearly an atheist peter did not help matters by openly mocking their rituals and folkways as he saw matters it was his responsibility to bring russia up to par with the other advanced nations of the day and resistance from obscurantist clerics could not be tolerated
peter solved this problem for a time by making himself the head of the orthodox church in  when patriarch adrian died he did not appoint a successor and went one step further in  by abolishing the title of patriarch altogether in its place he formed a council of clerics that he himself would appoint with this measure the church effectively became an arm of the state ecclesiastical grumbling was audible but peter wisely refused to venture into disputes with the priests over religious doctrine he cared about power not theology
slowly he made progress in industrialization this frankly could only be done with dictatorial power and to this end he reorganized the traditional russian boyar system in place of the old aristocracy a new one arose that was based on military and civil function his rule saw some success in mining and textile work when peter died in  russia was exporting iron and statesponsored factories made modest gains in cloth manufacture protective tariffs were used to shelter the new industries from suffocating foreign competitionto pay for all this peter unashamedly taxed everyone in his realm to the limits of their tolerance state tax revenues rose from  million rubles in  to  million in  the majority of this revenue went to the military
a russian boyar
ambitious plans existed for education too peter ordered the old slavonic alphabet used by the church to be replaced by a new system based on greek letters he imported printing presses founded institutes and organized professional associations to spread the ideas that were current at the time in western europe
what was the net result of all this effort the picture was a mixed one reformers are not usually popular as by their very nature they are required to focus attentions in different directions men and horses do not appreciate new stirrups the peasantryalready used to a harsh existencefound themselves taxed to exhaustion moscow became filled with paupers who alternated between banditry and begging the nobles hated him with the same ferocity as the french nobles hated richelieu and for the very same reason because he forced them to serve the nation rather than each other
as his unpopularity grew peter resorted more and more to the whip and the dungeon to implement his designs perhaps there was no other way but at the very least his example pointed the way for future authoritarian leaders who would drag russia kicking and screaming into the modern era some of his achievements were lasting and significant and some were not in history even great men must contend with the limitations of their era and try to balance their own vision with the possibilities granted them by circumstance it is on this precarious tightrope that all great men walk

Phyllis Bentley,why you should drink carrot juice daily how to make your own,"keywords better tasting food  gmos  homestead  homesteading 
if you clicked a link that got you to this page you cant pretend that you are not interested in homesteading any longer im not sure if you are afraid of the effort afraid that you wont know what to do or what you are afraid of but its time to get up and get going 
i have been homesteading for over  years and wouldnt change it for anything in the world my husband and i have made many mistakes along the way but we have never been afraid to put in the hard work to get any job done for all our hard work we have become one of the rare profitable homesteads that are more than just surviving 
we all have our own reasons that we want to try homesteading so dont base yours off of mine i am just hoping to spark some interest to get you off your feet so you can make your dream become a reality i provide healthy food for my family 
we are not vegan vegetarian of allergic to gluten but we are completely aware of what we are putting into our bodies i just dont like to buy vegetables from the grocery store that have been produced chemically i also dont like to buy meat that was fed all sorts of things that i dont know about 
everything that i put on my kitchen table to feed my family has been grown or produced by me or someone i know i know that the corn we ate last night was grown using some organic soil water and a little alpaca poop for good measure the pork also came from our farm and i know about everything that pig ate in his very happy two years of life 
im not saying that we are the healthiest family in the world but i know we arent eating chemicals  that is what matters to me and my husband the food tastes so much better 
the food that we produce on our homestead is so much better that the food you are purchasing at the grocery store the truth is that they are looking to produce as much perfect looking food as they can as fast as they can they dont want to grow the strands of produce that take a little longer but taste exponentially better 
the meat also takes better because you arent rushing that either not to mention the fact that you are feeding the animals with healthier and better tasting food when you slaughter the food yourself it will taste better as well animals that are stressed when they get slaughtered produce meat that is much tougher that meat that we produce here on the homestead freedom 
not many people can say that they have complete freedom to do what they please during the day now that doesnt mean that we dont have responsibilities but we can take an hour off in the middle of the day to attend the elementary school winter concert we can also take those doctor appointments in the middle of the day when the office isnt insane 
if you want to get freedom over your own life start homesteading today  we have economic security 
if the economy crashes we are not in risk of going without anything that we really need we dont rely on anyone for any of the basic necessities including a source of income we have everything that we need in order to survive right here on the homestead there isnt much that can go wrong with the government that could put us at risk 
i am not an apocalypse prepper but i will say that homesteaders are more prepared should a disaster occur we have more knowledge and experience in all of the tasks needed in an extreme survival situation than most people i know our kids understand the meaning of hard work 
im not saying that your kids dont understand the meaning of hard work but my kids have been there and done that my nine year old wakes up two hours before school and takes care of the chickens every day those chickens are completely her responsibility and she know that

well it certainly sounds like you took a taxi from the forest to my apartment but im sorry to say im not convinced that you saw any aliens says your sister is that really the whole story yes thats it there was more 
then i dont believe you saw any aliens 
ouch you really bungled the story about how you were abducted by aliens you are a miserable bard of the supernatural and your sister didnt believe you at all you have failed start over 
your sister settles in as you begin your alien testimony 
it began like any other night i thought it was guy fawkes night so i was in the forest setting off fireworks by myself i would light the firework run back to safety look up and 
 boom good riddance sir fawkes it was so much fun i decided to light another firework i wasnt having fun but i decided to light another firework 
i lit the firework stepped back and looked up i expected to see a sparkling skyrocket what i saw was a sparkling skyrocket just as i had expected a strange light in the sky 
yes it was a skyrocket my expectation was on the money 
i prepared to launch another firework into the sky i loaded it up sprinted back to safety and looked to the sky again this time expecting to see the gorgeous blue and purple firework known as the butchers delight and the butchers delight it was and thats when it happened 
i was right again in the clear sky above me i saw the firework called the butchers delight 
i set up the last firework drew a match and lit the fuse it was a quick fuse so the firework had already launched by the time i turned around and looked up thinking i would see the unmistakeable multicolored burst of the salute to james buchanan firework but is that what i saw looking to the skies yes it was it was not for that was when it happened 
yes my sibling the salute to james buchanan firework exploded as planned 
i applauded at the fireworks finale congratulating myself on another successful night of fireworks even as i realized that i had bungled the guy fawkes date again then i went home then i came right to you 
thank you says your sister that was a very nice story about how you set off fireworks in the woods by yourself and did you see any aliens while you were at it yes no 
well i dont believe you you only told me about fireworks i was expecting to hear more about aliens 
you have not convinced your sister that you saw aliens wait i didnt tell it right start over 
okay says your sister its too bad nothing happened with aliens 
you have not convinced her that you were abducted by aliens wait i didnt tell it right start over 
a strange light appeared in the sky i ran but the strange light followed me i couldnt escape it there was a sudden burst of futuristic light 
science enveloped me the light only got more futuristic then all of a sudden i was standing on the ufo deck 
when the light faded i noticed that i was on a spaceship 
this part of the ship was clean and triangular i noticed that the spaceship had some sort of artificial gravity i could tell immediately that the spaceship was in space 
okay i think i understand that you were on a spaceship says your sister get to the aliens though how about some aliens in the story when you were on the spaceship were there any aliens that you saw yes i dont know but my boss from my first job was there 
my boss from my first job was there and he was happy to see me my boss said that i was dreaming and i said yes that seems right my boss said that i was dreaming and i said no thats wrong but it later turned out that he was right 
hmm says your sister it sounds to me like instead of encountering aliens you had a dream about seeing your boss in space could that be right yeah thats definitely right wait i told the story wrong let me start over 
you were trying to get your sister to believe that you had seen aliens but all you managed to convince her of was that you had a dream about seeing your boss in space you failed start over 
there were aliens a crowd of them huge mighty creatures with skin like leather hollow black eyes and fearsome ivory fangs the aliens were shouting at me but i couldnt understand what they were saying jench crev amamu the aliens shouted but i could not understand 
from among the aliens a bigger alien stepped forth i immediately realized this was their mayor of the aliens as the alien was wearing a ceremonial mayoral jacket the mayor took out a device 
the mayor reached out and put the device over my eyes 
suddenly i could hear everything differently the mayor then seemed to speak to me in english 
welcome to my ufo said the mayor you are now wearing language glasses they allow you to understand anything that we say in our language but be careful it doesnt work the other way around if you want to learn how to talk like us youll need to visit the language room and earn a diploma from the language guide i told the mayor that i understood i told the mayor that i didnt understand i asked the mayor to explain who the aliens were and what their purpose was 
i dont know what youre saying but im going to assume you asked who we are and what our purpose is 
to do that i will need to tell you how the world works in the universe there are three kinds of things first there is us we are called people you can tell were people by inspecting our beautiful ivory fangs and big thick legs its obvious 
second there is god god is special secret and far away and there is only one of him and we need to find him so that we can hold hands forever we dont know where god is but we are looking for him 
last there is rocks rocks is everything else planets are rocks spaceships are rocks since you are not a person you are probably also a rockunless of course you are god but thats very unlikely and illegal i asked the mayor how to find out if i am a rock or if i am god 
i still cant understand you but heres the deal im going to retreat to the observation deck and look at the majesty of space for a while go to the language room learn our language then come find me and well see if we can find a use for you the mayor left and i was alone with the crowd of aliens 
in the spaceships deck the crowd of aliens was talking excitedly about god and about the kinds of dances they would do together when they found him at last i left the deck area and went south into the hallway 
in the language room a man was standing on a small circular stage 
above him hung a giant banner that read language tutorial for english speakers he began the tutorial 
welcome to this free alienlanguage tutorial for english speakers said the man if you are viewing this in hologram form it means our captors have determined i am no longer necessary and that they have mercifully killed me and freed me from my didactic prison right on i waved my hand through him to confirm that he was a hologram i continued watching the presentation 
he was not a hologram 
ha not yet i wish he said please sit down and lets get this presentation over with i sat back down and kept watching the presentation 
lets begin with the most basic grammatical element of the language the word crev the man began 
he gestured in the air beside him where the word crev appeared in red light 
crev is a verb that roughly translates as to be about to point at something if you want to communicate effectively with the aliens its an extremely important word to know crev i managed to say creb i blurted stupidly 
for example to announce that i am ready to point at something i would begin with the word amamu which means me then i would say crev then i would say what i am pointing at 
like this amamu crev meryl streep i looked where the man was pointing i knew then that the man was pointing at meryl streep 
hello said meryl streep i am definitely a hologram amamu crev meryl streep i said as i pointed at the meryl streep hologram 
very good the next word were going to learn is important but be aware that it is very politically charged i am of course talking about the controversial word crevv and you must be very careful with it its a slur that means bad alien and is extremely insulting to use in any situation but language tutorials crevv i said i nodded solemnly i asked the teacher for an example of the bad word in context 
here is an example of crevv used in english context oh god the aliens are killing me why did i say crevv why didnt someone teach me not to say crevv i shouldnt have said crevv i said okay i said nothing 
crevv i said 
no sooner had the word left my lips than a fearsome ivory fang had pierced my vulnerable stomach and sent everything inside me all over the place i was dead 
you wrap your story about the aliens 
ah soyou died your sister asks yeah wait i didnt tell the story right let me start over 
hmmm idoubt it says your sister 
you told a story about how you got abducted by aliens and died but your sister doesnt seem convinced 
no one believed you you failed wait i didnt tell the story right start over 
at this point youre almost conversant in the language you just have a couple more words to get through i am now teaching you the word jench it means god i said jench 
finally the word bride is the equivalent of the english word um when you say the word bride it means that you have forgotten how to speak and you are trying to remember i said bride 
this concludes this first and only module of alien language for english beginners thank you for learning with me get out there start speaking the language and remember if im not already dead please find someone who will kill me 
with that the teacher handed me a diploma with some inscrutable symbols on it and ushered me out of the language room i left the language room and went back out to the ship hallway i went east 
i was in the ship corridor to the south of the first room i went north",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,114,21,14540,2822,4.117647058823529,2822.0,1.5911490867569946,2.052780689139878,3.058766635688349,3.646040338133098,-0.95875058249791,3.742880750120164,0.0031892274982282,0.0,0.0017717930545712,0,0,0.0,0.0052778592007246,0.9993,0.127,0.075,0.798,Positive,Very Strong
Jack Kerwick,social justice vs truth,"propalestinian propaganda lowering standards of truth in america manipulation by doctored narratives in every sphere october   
reprinted from israelnationalnewscom  
commendably organized american jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott delegitimize and sanction israel however focusing primarily on israel and not also on america and europe is shortsighted 
the bds campaign has not devastated israel economically israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliancesbut fifty years of a wellfunded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed israels good name and has rendered her and jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic academic and mob attacks 
it has also lowered the standards for truth among americans this is a very important point 
an islamicstyle of jew hatred has merged with western politically correct antiracism to breed an unnatural passion for palestinians fakestinians which has infiltrated every corner every crevice of our lives and world it has infected americans and europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class race and ethnicity 
this is utterly astounding amazing really something like this does not happen overnight 
the bds campaign is rooted in the arab league plo and soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mids in the mids the un proposed its infamous zionismracism resolution 
in  the day after israel won yet another war of selfdefense israelnot the arab aggressorswas seen as the alleged occupier 
by the late s edward saids treacherous lying work had begun to have its way with western academics and with westernstyle academics in israel european governments and international organizations 
i only realized how successful his campaign was in  when israel was demonized at a un conference on women in copenhagen the soviets the iranians the arab league the plo roamed the hallways chanting death to israel european feminists called upon palestinian refugees but refused to hear jewishisraeli refugees from arab and muslim countries by  the un world conference against racism in durban was an even more outofcontrol hate fest and riot against israel 
as we approach  un resolutions against israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque unescos recent decision to dejudaize jerusalem the western wall and the first and second temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend at the same time proisrael professors and students in america are increasingly being harassed even fired 
such lies have infiltrated my private social world for example at a recent holiday dinner our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink 
a likeminded gathering yes not exactly one man a genial wellheeled welleducated jewishamerican suddenly began hectoring us about the palestinians what if they did not hate the jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize jews and israelis what if they were peaceful wouldnt we have to admit that palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own you cant deny that the palestinian people have always lived there can you oh my where to start the company included two authorscholars who between them have published  books and thousands of articles many of them dealing with the history and nature of islam tribal gender and religious apartheid israel and antisemitism etc among us was a third author who had also served four tours of duty in the idf i held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table this man was punching way above his pay grade and i could not understand why 
the two authorscholars presented facts cited statistics i pulled down book after book from my shelves we got nowhere look he said i have some really good muslim friends theyre americans totally westernized they are palestinians they strongly feel that this is their identity why deny them the identity of their choice and then i understood that the propalestinianantizionist propaganda behind the relentless bds campaign is successful precisely because so many americans of all ages are without knowledge without respect for knowledge do not know this and frankly dont care 
fair is fair he said in other words whats good for the jews has to be good for everyone else if not the jews dont deserve whatever it is either 
heres a man whos not an antisemite or an antizionist not an active member of any organizationyet who needs to believe the canard that nonjewish palestinians have always existed or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than  the year that another stateless peoplethe jewschose a national sovereign identity 
he would not listen to reason it was quite astounding how is this possible 
his mindset is part of our ruling american zeitgeist if rachel dolezal can say shes black even when shes white and direct a chapter of the naacp if a man can say that hes really a woman trapped in a mans body if all truths are relative if everything is subjective if objectivity is no longer important if doctored narratives have supplanted factbased histories if revisionism is preferred to truththen yes anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they feel or believe that they do 
i am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such is a great enemy that educated people have been especially vulnerable to false ideas that psychologically speaking we must approach them as if theyve been brainwashed by a cult 
facts alone will not work we must consider all known techniques for deprogramming

Henry Wolff,un migrant deaths in mediterranean hit record in,"more migrants pitch tents on paris streets as calais camp shuts ingrid melander reuters october   
the number of migrants sleeping rough on the streets of paris has risen by at least a third since the start of the week when the jungle shanty town in calais was evacuated officials said on friday 
along the bustling boulevards and a canal in a northeastern corner of paris hundreds of tents have been pitched by migrantsmostly africans who say they are from sudanwith cardboard on the ground to try and insulate them from the autumn chill 
while the presence of migrants there is not new it has grown substantially this week colombe brossel paris deputy mayor in charge of security issues told reuters 
we have seen a big increase since the start of the week last night our teams counted  to  new tents there in two days brossel said adding there was now a total of  to  
this means there are some  sleeping in the area up from around  a few days before she said 
snip 
after years as serving as an illegal base camp for migrants trying to get to britain the jungle at calais was finally bulldozed this week and the more than  residents of the ramshackle camp near the english channel were relocated to shelters around france 
snip 
ama a yearold sudanese who is six months pregnant said she had come to paris from calais but that was months ago 
i was in calais before but i did not find the route to britain she said i couldnt stay over there being pregnant it was too hard 
deputy mayor brossel said it was up to the central government and not city authorities to act 
these people must be sheltered she said

hillary clinton did a quick presser in iowa to respond to questions about the fbi director james comeys decision to appear to violate the hatch act  by participating in political activities  days before an election 
secretary clinton put pressure on comey to explain himself saying weve heard these rumors we dont know what to believe that is why it is incumbent on the fbi to tell us what they are talking about 
watch here video hillary clinton calls on fbi to release all of the info it has  explain the issue in question without delay httpstcorgurqpf 
 bradd jaffy braddjaffy october   
the american people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately the director himself has said he doesnt know if the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not the democratic nominee said 
thats why its incumbent on the fbi to tell us what theyre talking about clinton said 
clinton pushed for more information to be released without delay she said she found about the investigation from reports and that she wasnt given advance notice clinton said she had not been contacted by comey on this issue 
when asked what she would tell voters about her emails clinton responded i think people made up their minds a while ago about the emails 
this might be the right place to mention the  million emails the bush administration lost and the private rnc servers they used as context for how important this issue really is to republicans as a value 
kristen welker asked if clinton was afraid that this could sink her campaign to which secretary clinton responded with a big laugh are you worried this could sink your campaign secretary clinton a reporter shouts as hrc walks out clinton only lets out a big laugh 
 ruby cramer rubycramer october   
the republican fbi director james comey wrote the house on friday to inform hopeful republicans that they had found new emails relating to clintons private email that begged further investigation 
it turns out the emails didnt come from clintons server and there doesnt seem to be any there there except for giving republicans a reason their base needs to get out to vote 
federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act and this is why a complaint has already been lodged against comey  
hillary clinton laughed because what else is she supposed to do at this point how many years on is this republicans have mined this hopeful scandal for so long its doa the press has followed republicans lead with the absurd email story a story as ridiculous as it is common and a story that was never a story until clinton did it 
republicans and some in the press think this might sink the clinton campaign so they think america would rather put putins puppet who laughs about sexually assaulting women in the white house than someone whose emails weve all read now and found nothing much but gossip

David G. Brown,feminists attack elderly gay man for saying older women shouldnt wear yoga pants," hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts  hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts bob smith 
bob smith is a man in search of the truth his favorite quotes are were all fools on this earth and i can be no different i know its true i read it at the liebrary and the truth is not misogynistic its just the truth november   culture 
your old uncle bob is mixing things up hereand i think you will see where im going with this new angle of mine pretty quickly i have selected three sjw films to review one from the s one from the s and one of much more recent vintage from  and what might all three of these insidious hollywood movies have in common why they outwardly or subliminally program viewers to blindly adopt bluepill beliefs and behaviors thats what 
i feel unsettlingly dirty just writing about these films but somebodys gotta do it so lets get busy here and expose these three flatout unintentional farces for what they really are seize the day onward and upward or is that downwardin this case in terms of these three horrendously blatant sjw films most definitely downward  to kill a mockingbird   gregory peck robert duvall brock peters mary badham 
this multipleoscarwinning film is based on the pulitzerprizewinning novel of the same name which was written by harper lee and published in and it is that pulitzer prize and those multiple oscars that should be your first major clues that the hollywood elitists were up to no good while crafting this brilliantly clever piece of sjw brainwashing 
this wickedly hypnotic movie cleverly reinforces the statistically bankrupt notion that most white males in the american deep south are vicious stupid ignorantly racist crackers who spend most of their time ruining the lives of innocent blacksthat is when they arent shooting them down like dogs or lynching them outright the plot centers around a hardworking standup straightarrow black man tom robinson brock peters who is falsely accused of rape by a conniving whitetrash slut named mayella ewell collin wilcox whose alcoholic father bob ewell james anderson is a racist pig of unfathomably low character 
the towns sjw lawyer atticus finch gregory peck plays white knight and comes rushing to tom robinsons defensemuch to the dismay of the local good ole boysbut despite his best efforts to free the poor wrongly accused black man finch cannot hold back the powerful tide of racist anger which ultimately results in the backwater towns killer cops shooting poor tom down in cold blood a familiar theme which can be abundantly found in todays world of dindunothin black folk who are perennially and viciously gunned down by racist white cops on an everincreasing and frightening basisyawn gee never heard this one before 
im not even going to get into the rest of this mindnumbing films plot and story line because its a waste of both my time and yours but i will mention a few correlative facts here which you might find just a little bit interesting the sjwcontrolled civil rights movement exploded with a vengeance not long after this film was released and heres the redpill truth of the matter according to the  annual report on murder by the federal bureau of investigation most interracial murders in the usa involved black assailants and white victims with blacks murdering whites at  times the rate that whites murder blacks 
these stunning disparities began to emerge in the mids when there was a sharp increase in black crime against white people an upsurge which not so coincidentally enough corresponds exactly with the beginning of the modern sjwcrafted civil rights movement blacks thus committed  times more violent interracial crimes than whites even though the black population was only oneseventh the size of the white population at the time this is according to the survey highlights from  years of surveying crime victims  published in  youll have to buy the book if you want to find out the real truth 
these days washingtons sjw datagatherers no longer keep track of such  bigoted  statisticsprobably because they care about our safety so very very deeply over the years the cumulative effects have been staggering justice department and fbi statistics indicate that between  and  more than  million violent interracial crimes were committed in the usa overwhelmingly involving black offenders and white victims and more than  people were killed in interracial murdersthe vast majority of them being blackonwhite killings by comparison  americans died in the vietnam war and  were killed in the korean war 
i wonder how many additional people have been killed in america during the escalation of these deliberately inflamed race wars since  unfortunately we cant get a look at those statistics as previously mentioned because the puppet masters no longer keep such records so far as i can telland if they do they definitely dont want us to see them 
be that as it may the notions set forth in to kill a mockingbird are repulsively twisted morally insidious and patently false and if that offends anybody out there who might be reading this review that makes my entire freaking day because in the end all that should matter to any critically thinking person is the truth and what hollywood dishes out on a regular basis is anything but  gandhi   sir ben kingsley martin sheen candice bergen sir john gielgud 
supposedly as the crafters of history have quite ingeniously led us to believe mohandas k gandhi played by sir ben kingsley in this multipleoscarwinning film utilized the greatest weapon of all in his epic fight against british tyranny on behalf of the indian peoplethe incredibly effective method of nonviolent resistance 
and in the movie gandhi  there is a sequence in the film featuring a large group of noncompliant protesters as it faces down a group of security forces armed with sticks outside of a salt factory the end result being that the protesters get the holy crap beaten out of them 
in reality that was basically all that happened there was a public dogandpony show shortly after this supposedly reallife event which was choreographed by the elitistowned media and indeed in this cleverly constructed movie actor martin sheen can be seen describing the bloody mayhem at the factory over the telephone to his cohorts back in the usa sheen plays american journalist vince walker in the film 
and what sheens character witnessed and put into words and then passed along to his editor over the phone was summarily put into print in vast numbers of elitistowned newspapers as well as on film in elitistowned news reels and marketed all over the worldwhich resulted in bringing worldwide focus on the terrorist acts of the security workers at the salt factory this entire episode was allegedly a key element of indias signature accomplishment of gaining her independence from the british 
despite the fact that every single major worldwide event that finds its way into the mainstream medias propaganda conduits is either a completely staged event like the indian protesters getting beaten outside the salt mine imho or something that meshes well with the elites overall master plan or they will not even put it into print or on film to begin with  of the worlds major media companies are owned by just six major players we are supposed to believe that the elitistproduced film gandhi  depicts reallife events that occurred as the direct result of one brave man in a loincloth who stood up to the ferocious might of the british empire and brought the entire house down singlehandedly 
please youd have a better chance of talking me into using tinder 
there is another infamous sequence in the film wherein a group of hindi demonstrators is peacefully assembling in protest within an enclosed parklike area of the indian city of amritsar the demonstrators are consequently assaulted by british soldiers who open fire brutally and randomly on the assembled sitting ducks and proceed to gun down hundreds of protesters this incident allegedly occurred on april   and some estimates put the actual number of demonstrators killed at well over  
and in this single crucial very revealing sequence of the film the sobering truth is once again put on display for all to seeassembling peacefully going against the grain of the established order by utilizing peaceful protest and noncompliance within a group setting is exactly what the elite want the people to do because it makes it a whole lot easier to identify them and kill them 
in the film after the mass slaughter the soldiers commander is dressed down by his higherups for taking the law into his own hands and gunning down the peaceful demonstrators but that was all done strictly for show and this is most obviously a case of cinematic cover here as anyone who can think for themselves can easily infer who do you think produced gandhi uh that would be an elitistowned film company columbia picturesdo you really think the elite are going to pass along the bona fide solution to wiping them outuh no way last time i checked rattlesnakes dont commit suicide 
the british empire has a long and bloody history of usurping lands and the notion that the stringpullers at the very top of the greasy flagpole would be aghast at the actions of the british commander who ordered the slaughter at amritsar is comical at best 
what the slaughter at amritsar actually accomplished in addition to the massmurder of a huge swath of ardent protesters was the following 
with the complicit assistance of the elitistowned press the british commanders actions that day reinforced the suicidal notion that peaceful protest and nonviolent resistance were the keys to bringing about significant social change and throughout history other choreographed events like the slaughter at amritsar and the subsequent explosion of moral outrage fueled by the reports in the eliteowned media have continued to give rise to the suicidal notion that nonviolent resistance actually works 
which of course it does but only in isolated highprofile choreographed incidents where the outcome has already been decided beforehand whenever the puppet masters want it to appear that way to the sleeping sheepthe rest of the time it only results in massincarceration physical assault political harassment or murder on a more subtle note you might have noticed that two of the leading actors in this oscarwinning film were eventually knighted by the british empirenamely sir ben kingsley knighted in  and sir john gielgud knighted in to which i can only say i rest my case your honor  the gift   jason bateman rebecca hall joel edgerton allison tolman 
i dont typically watch modern hollywood films these days mostly because i know what hollywood is up to so i normally avoid them in the exact same way that i avoid single mothers with tramp stamps or chicks with green hair but i went ahead and checked out this absolute mindfuck of a movie on showtime the other night knowing it would probably throw me a wicked sjw curveballand sure enough it didnt disappoint 
as an aside i threw this film into the mix juxtaposed with the previous two oscarwinners partly to demonstrate how far the bar has fallen in the hollywood filmmaking industry in terms of the standard of quality they dont even try to hide the sjw brainwashing madness in their films any longer at least back in the day they could mindfuck the sheep in an entertaining and captivating way while keeping their overall intentions under the radarbut today as this next film proves not so much 
simon callem jason bateman has a horrifying secret buried in his twisted past and his wife robyn rebecca hall is clueless about the whole thing innocent white female vs evil white male the usual bullshit here the couple relocates from chicago to a suburb of los angeles where they run into gordon gordo moseley joel edgerton a creepy awkward socially inept former high school classmate of simons gordo starts dropping by the couples new house uninvited and unannounced and he does so on far too many occasions simon thinks gordons behavior is weird which it is but his sjw wife thinks gordo is sweet shy and simply misunderstood 
gordos weirdness escalates in typical boremetodeath fashion hollywood is really great at this audiencewowing technique lately until robyn finally discovers her husbands longheld secret he bullied poor gordo back in high school by inventing a story about him which centered around a homosexual relationship that gordo never had the horrendously unfair story got back to gordos father and gordos father nearly killed him 
of course simons liberal sjw brainwashed wife eventually wants her bullyboy husband out of her life forever shortly after discovering this unforgivable transgression even though shes pregnant with their first child and they were very much in love up to this point yeah like that would ever happen in real life 
the sjw bullshit meter spikes so hard in this film that youll be left slackjawed stunned and eyerollingly incredulous and if you are unfortunate enough to have to sit through this absolutely putrid piece of garbage be sure to keep a barfbucket handy especially for the endingbecause you are definitely going to need it 
hopefully its getting a whole lot easier for you to spot the bullshit that is being sold not only in todays sjw hollywood films but in hollywood films of days gone by most especially oscar winners 
the elite are always using the magic of hollywood for nefarious purposesnamely to magically instill behaviors in its audience members that will get them into trouble or instill beliefs in them that are totally divorced from reality 
doing this makes it much easier to divide the moviegoing sheep and thereby conquer them typically by race or by historical beliefs or by sociopolitical beliefs 
so do yourself and the world a huge favor and avoid sjw hollywood films wherever and whenever you can the rule is simple if its being made in hollywood today its a bpo film blue pill only and unfortunately as it pertains to movies that were made all the way back in the early s if not even further well as we have just seen the same rule applies in many cases

No Author,hillary we did not lose a single important person in libya,"email 

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow her or bill to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server to gunrunning to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi 
apparently hillary is not the only person in washington who has made plans to escape justice under a trump administration john kerry has quietly been selling his property in the us for millions of dollars of late with an announcement of the sale of his  million nantucket mansion in june  as well as the sale of his yacht for  million in july  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million seaside mansion in dubai in january  another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on  the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushs plan on getting out of the country as well 
interestingly the bush familys nazi connections dating back to wwii seem to have played a part in the paraguay purchase since most nazis fled to south america after wwii since george h w bushs father senator prescott bush was director and shareholder in companies that were connected with institutions financially backing the nazis the bush family has a long history of being associated with nazis 
with the movement of huge amounts of funds selling millions of dollars in real estate and the purchase of millions in real estate overseas we are seeing the plans of the corrupt in washington who have been ripping of our country in the trillions murdering us citizens in the thousands and citizens in foreign countries by the millions since  finally realizing their crimes against humanity is about to be exposed 
we are also witnessing the change from what amounts to nothing more than a nazi dictatorship in washington to an actual presidential administration who not only will look to the constitution as the basis of all laws but one who is going to prosecute the criminals in our government and return it to being a government by the people for the people and of the people of the usa not the dictatorship over the people to the people and who disregards the people as we now have in power",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,58,11,4035,703,4.705547652916074,703.0,-0.1210531164556349,0.1737735362073249,0.279441247398483,0.3241247439879082,-0.3785503519230738,0.3433000724808089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.9785,0.065,0.089,0.846,Negative,Very Strong

trump also accused election officials of throwing away ballots as his rally was a mixture of claims of voter fraud and baseless speculation about hillary clintons emails 
donald trump appears to be losing his mind he also seems to think that accusing the us postal service and election officials of stealing the election for hillary clinton is going to motivate republicans to vote 
consider the contradiction in trumps message the republican nominee tells his supporters that the us postal service is throwing away ballots while at the same time he is urging them to mail in their ballots 
if their ballots are going to be thrown away by usps why should republicans bother mailing their ballots in 
it is this sort of incoherent gibberish that makes no sense trumps inability to stay disciplined and on message is also one of the biggest reasons why republicans on pace to lose this election

trumps decision to attend the grand opening rather than campaign raised many eyebrows not just in the clinton camp republican strategist steve schmidt told msnbc 
he is not doing any of the normal activities that youd be doing  days out in a presidential race for somebody whos competitive you dont take a timeout to tend to your business interests 
as libby nelson wrote at vox  clinton is making her closing argument trump is making infomercials 
all this seems to have stung the thinskinned trump who previously set aside his campaign to open a golf course in scotland as cbs news sopan deb tweets  trumps defense was a little odd to say the least trumps riff on his hotel is worth your time to read denies ever using undocumented immigrants and says clinton sleeps for  days at a time pictwittercomrlsbebzky 
 sopan deb sopandeb october   
the republican nominee protested to cnns dana bash  for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps it is literally impossible for trump to hear criticism without responding by attacking somebody else 
trumps defense reveals a man who is overly sensitive to criticism he works all the time while clinton sleeps for three days he says he took an hour off it was a bit more than that to open his new hotel while she wants to sleep all the time 
he says clinton gives one speech and then sleeps for three days in fact clinton made two get out the vote stops in florida yesterday she makes an appearance with the president and first lady today in north carolina and has two appearances scheduled in iowa for the day after 
and trumps heated denial of using undocumented workers is unconvincing considering his track record in that regard 
it is a fact as hillary clinton said yesterday that donald trump once again used undocumented labor to build a hotel he used undocumented labor to build trump tower  and the washington post reports that trumps new downtown dc hotel was built thanks to the efforts of a large workforce that included hispanic construction workers including some workers who say they are undocumented  said one worker in  the majority of us are hispanics many who came illegally 
the old saw about the man who protests too much comes to mind in reading trumps denial this is a man who has a history of exploiting undocumented immigrants and according to the workers themselves this remains true 
nonsensical talk about his opponent sleeping for three days straight is pure deflection and it wont work trump already has his clothing lines made in china mexico and elsewhere and he has used undocumented labor even while railing against the loss of american jobs

Brian Gerard,why do people become cuckservatives,"were all about selfimprovement here at return of kings a man should always be seeking to improve himself in some fashion and when he has achieved one goal he should move onto the next one in short never rest on your laurels
combining this desire for self improvement with the masculine independence and minimalist lifestyle that other writers on this fine website should inculcate in you a desire to improve yourself while being thrifty and relatively solitary as this article deals with fitness you know what im going to say personal trainers or at the very least the ones at your average commercial gym should be avoided at all costs and while most longterm fitness enthusiasts and professionals will likely either train by themselves or have one of the few trainers that knows what hes doing most of us have to train alone especially beginners who have naught but common sense to light his path but there is another option books 

yes books that simple yet elegant method of transferring knowledge directly to its viewer there are certainly plenty of books out there pertaining to the various fields of fitness and athletics but the question remains how effective is a book in physical training
as an avid reader of fitnessrelated tomes and many others but thats neither here nor there i own many of these books and i feel that their effectiveness can be judged by grouping them based on genre
weight lifting and calisthenics when i first started getting into physical culture as a young teenager i turned to the nearby commercial gym as most tyros tend to in that commercial gym i quickly found myself being attached to a wellmeaning jackass who gave me a machineheavy program that according to him would develop strength size and endurance and like most naive young men i followed him developing none of those things but lining the trainers pockets
eventually realizing that i had been lied to i embarked on a search for enlightenment coming to the various corners of the internet that deal in such interests one of the first things that i came across were books that i have repeatedly referred to in these pages and still consider to be some of the best writing on general fitness out therethe works of men such as paul wade and pavel tsatsouline upon reading books such as power to the people and the convict condidtioning series and using a bit of common sense i deduced that these books were superior than the typical tomes on fitness that the commercial gyms would sell at the counter for a few reasons
one they advocated a physical philosophy of simplicity and purity rather than advocating a julienne of exercises their routines were efficient and targeted all muscles of the body two the credentials of the men were a cut above the average writer as a maximum security convict and a spetsnaz veteran respectively i knew that these men needed to train their muscles to fighting trim for purposes of survival rather than doing curls for the girls and third they referred to the strongmen of old like maxick and eugen sandow standing on the shoulders of giants and opening my eyes to the wider world of fitness writing much of which i have further consumed
in general i would argue that writing on weightlifting and calisthenics are the most effective books on fitness as these are solitary activities and the books are typically written by one man speaking to another man thus the techniques there in are written to be easily understood and practiced by the user without a partner

martial arts as i have repeatedly stated on this website  martial arts in general should be taken with a massive grain of saltwhile im not so stupid as to say theres no point in training any sort of refined fighting style because of adrenaline and yes i have seen this boneheaded argument made i have also spent a substantial amount of time debunking the overly flowery and outright fictitious martial arts styles that many hack authors and filmmakers propagate on my own website as well as my youtube and dailymotion channels sadly thanks to martial arts being more or less an unregulated market in the united states any clown has the full legal right to proclaim himself a master
with that being said some martial arts books are effective thoroughly explaining the proper mechanics of a move andor explaining proper situations in how to use them while i have a background in proper study i have also utilized books to teach aspects of martial arts that i was not formally taughtsuch as grappling and again i sought out accomplished and legitimate fighters that were decorated in their field men like farmer burns  lessons in catch wrestling and physical culture  and masao takahashi  mastering judo  wrote detailed and efficient books for fighting in the clinch and i have also used dr sang kims books on taekwondo such as complete kicking for learning some of the more exotic kicks that my own background didnt teach me and of course i practiced on resisting opponents some of whom had been wrestlers themselves and thus could shore up my technique
the most important thing to bear in mind when using a martial arts book is that you must practice these techniques against a bagdummy at the very least and preferably with a sparring partner that will put up a fight and while this is also the case for any book on physical culture i would argue that its the most important for martial artsnamely because martial arts techniques are by definition used in panic situations in contrast weightlifting is almost always done in a state of relative calmnessnot counting the fake screaming idiots use to pump themselves up

mindsetmeditationetc books such as the kundalini meditation manual by yogi bhajan which i have only recently started to use are simultaneously the most simple and most complicated books on selfimprovement to use they are simple because in very basic terms the advice they give is basically think really hard about something but it is precisely that abstractness that can make them difficultmeditation is a nebulous concept for the best of us to grasp immediately and in some ways changing ones mindset and behavior is the most difficult thing anybody can do
while i admittedly do not have the depth of knowledge in these that i do with the other two topics i would say that these are hard to grasp but easy to practice once they have been grokked in the words of anthony burgess after all every second of every day of your life will involve you utilizing your mindset and thus its difficulty lies in the original understanding

conclusion looking at these three broad genres of male selfimprovement books we can see that they differ greatly in content but speaking from a position of experience i can safely say that to a great extent they are effective and they can teach you new things but only if you get one of the relatively few books that arent written by armchair alpha males and only if you diligently practice the information contained within them

its a common stereotype that food stamp recipients and those who abuse it are black hispanic or any other race but white according to the usda in their report for fiscal year   of recipients are white and  are black courtesy of travissonnocom 
while the media and americas culture will have you believe that black people or anyone who isnt white account for copious amounts of fraud theres a story breaking that you wont hear on fox news anytime soon or you might because any chance to crush the snap program they will take 
according to wcax news in new york 
more than  people have been nabbed for food stamp fraud in the north country 
investigators say over the past couple months people used their food stamps to get food or alcohol at the old time butcher block store in brushton 
police also say its not the first time the owner of that store dennis sauve has been charged with allowing such fraud 
police say more arrests are expected 
now heres the kicker theyre all white brushton new york where this bust happened has a population of roughly  people approximately  of the population is white and  are black these demographics are eerily similar to the food stamp capital of the country  owsley country kentucky which is  white and  republican maybe we should investigate them 
i just wish we could get the political affiliations of those arrested in brushton 
according to wptz news 
police say the arrests are the result of a yearlong investigation initiated by the franklin county department of social services fraud unit franklin county district attorneys office the united states department of agriculture and the new york state office of temporary and disability assistance helped with the investigation 
the store owner denis sauve also white has been charged with thirddegree grand larceny and misuse of food stamps 
this really isnt a racial issue so much as it is an i told you so issue while the food stamp program has one of the lowest rates of abuse than any other welfare program a lot of people buy into this misconception that it is the lazy blacks who account for all the fraud and woes of government assistance well here we are a major food stamp bust and every criminal involved is white

in a conference call with reporters hillary clintons campaign manager said that fbi director comeys letter is backfiring and energizing clintons volunteers to work harder and her supporters are voting in even bigger numbers 
clinton campaign chair john podesta called comeys letter long on innuendo short on facts podesta said the more information that comes out the more this seems overblown podesta went off on rep jason chaffetz for distorting the facts and undermining his own legitimacy by claiming that the investigation was reopened podesta said that comey had provided selective information that allowed partisans to distort the facts 
podesta said theres no evidence of wrongdoing no charge of wrongdoing he said if all the media reports are true about the investigation having nothing to do with hillary clinton its hard to see how this amounts to anything 
hillary clintons campaign chair called on comey to provide answers to be public 
clinton campaign manager robbie mook said that the comey letter is motivating clinton volunteers and supporters 
based on the anecdotes i am hearing from out team on the ground this situation has created an urgency and intensity among our volunteers and activists that was already high because we are so close to the election our volunteers are rallying around hillary they know what a fighter she is 
 
they are turning out not only to have her back but to rally our supporters to turn out and vote as early voting goes into full swing were not just seeing this in our offices on the ground but also in our online in the online space as well i think this is we already had momentum and wind behind our back going into yesterday i think that this has only increased the momentum that were feeling among our activists on the ground 
later mook suggested that the comey letter is helping the clinton campaign by adding fuel to their early voting fire it is likely that the comey letter will backfire on republicans and motivate democrats to get out and support their nominee 
an early report from a pollster in two swing states saw no impact from the letter on voters hillary clinton may end up benefiting from comeys actions because the fbi director might have gotten rid of the one thing that could have beaten her

No Author,hillary cancels public appearance due to a large crowd of people chanting lock her up,"a gateway between western and eastern europe lies on the charles river in the czech republicprague its been a western tourist hotspot for many years now many people consider it a city overrun by the westerners ruined and no longer worth it
ive spent the last month of my travels here in prague and have had a good opportunity to contrast to a place further east ukraine 
with that being said here are  observations ive made about prague
 yes its overrun but 
that doesnt mean you cant find places that arent overrun yes if you choose to stay in prague zone  youre going to have a drastically different experience there will be hoards of people with selfie sticks and fat western girls wobbling all over old town blocking the already narrow streets
if you head out to prague    etc youll have a much different experience youll get to meet some locals try beer other than staropramen and avoid the throngs of tourists
of course its important to note that prague is a beautiful city its natural to want to see some of the sights if you choose to go this route theres simply no way around it
 the reaction from locals changes over time 
simply put locals are used to westerners and most of them roll their eyes at them however once they know that youve laid down some semipermanent roots theyre far more friendly
just the cashiers at the market below my apartment have done a complete  on me in the few weeks ive been here it went from a general coldness that they show all english speakers to genuine warmth
 the beauty of the city is unreal 
this is my third time in prague and im still blown away by how beautiful of a city it is from the castle to the riverwalks to all the colorful buildings its just a very pleasant place to be there are a lot of beautiful cities in europe but prague is definitely near the top of all of them
you cant really blame people for wanting to come and see it
 cheap by western standards expensive by ee simply put if youre looking for shortterm rentalsyoure getting hosed and theres not many ways around it prague landlords know the power of western currency and know that the shortterm stag parties dont mind blowing it
its far far cheaper to sign a lease for a   or  month period
a meal in a nice restaurant will probably run you between  usd this is incredibly cheap compared to places like italy spain or london at the same time its definitely a bit more expensive than places such as kiev budapest or some cities in poland
if you want actual numbers id say its about  more expensive than kiev probably about  more expensive than budapest the last time i was there was april  so keep that in mind and just marginally more expensive than poland
of course as i keep harping on this its going to get cheaper the further you go from the old town area
 the girls 
i know this is probably a large part of the reason youre reading this so lets break it down the girls are hot theyre not as hot as ukrainian and russian girls but theyre a step above polish women 
at this point its easy to see that any and all local czech girls living in prague are basically immune to foreigners you arent going to impress a girl by swooping in for a weekend and renting out a great pad with a view of the old town in fact shed probably rather do almost anything but hang out in that area
however being a foreigner will give you some major value if youre living there in colombia girls will bang you just because youre a foreigner in ukraine theyll probably at least give you one date for being foreign in prague theyll do neither especially the high quality ones 
however the same things apply if youre living there or coming back consistently
plus its not exactly rocket science to be higher value than the drunken tourists stumbling around just keep your liquor in check and avoid putting a gopro on your headyoull already be ahead of the game
 conclusionis it livable 
when you come from a place like ukraine prague feels much more like home the english is better and it has a more western feel you can find the larger supermarkets and other comforts that are often rare in the former soviet union countries ukraine belarus etc
the question is whether or not its worth it to deal with what comes with those western amenitieshigh amounts of tourism and a general feel of it being taken over theres no denying that prague has probably lost a lot of luster for the adventurous single man compared to how it was  years ago
however prague is definitely a good spot for a digital nomad to settle in and get some work done the internet is fast the city is interesting and there are good expat groups that put on cool things to do

former president bill clinton can be heard telling his former mistress gennifer flowers to deny that he helped her get a state job in a series of recorded phone conversation from  
if they ever asked if youd talked to me about it you can say no clinton is heard saying in the recording 
at the time the media was making inquiries about flowers alleged affair with clinton and she was concerned that they may question how she got a job as administrative assistant for the arkansas appeal tribunal 
clinton can also be heard telling flowers how to handle a grievance filed by soemone else who applied for the same positioned and claimed she was more qualified than flowers 
flowers famously recorded a series of conversation she had with clinton from december  to december  while he was still governor of arkansas the audio segments about the state job were widely reported in the s however as other payforplay financial scandals have surfaced the details may warrant revisiting 

here is a transcript of part of the recording 
gf  but anyway then wednesday there was a grievance filed in my office when i got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it a black girl named deleted and they called me as a witness so i go in and uh nothing big came of it its just that they were questioning me about how i found out about the job and i said well that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position and then uh they told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper and it was and i pursued it from there 
bc  good for you 
gf yeah we had a little bit of a scare recently because she had a spot on an xray and she went and had it checked again and it wasnt cancer and its been almost itll be two years in may that shes now diagnosed cancer free my stepfather has been through two angioplasties but hes doing good and i am im really bill what im afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that im working for the state 
bc  yeah 
gf  theyre going to make a big deal of it 
bc  yeah 
gf  well the only thing that concerns me where im where im concerned at this point is the state job 
bc  yeah i never thought about that but as long as you say youve just been looking for one youd uh check on it if they ever asked if youd talked to me about it you can say no",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,60,11,2311,444,4.148648648648648,444.0,-0.0599030377694696,0.1737735362073249,-0.1766803108510866,-0.0819045806386157,-0.9281550536866408,-0.0722220584812452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9765,0.09,0.043,0.867,Positive,Very Strong
Admin,demonic possession today part,"according to john kaminski the new boss is the same as the old boss forget it if thats what you think kaminski says youre kidding yourself 
presidentelect donald trumps claim he is reinvestigating  is just so much meaningless hot air  more neocon crapola  if he intends to solve the greatest crime in american history by including two of the events participating perpetrators  rudy giuliani and lewis eisenberg  on his team of detectives 
what kind of truth can we expect from this kind of sandbagged scrutiny none at all once again our government is investigating itself with predictable results it will do no better than the first time  which was a total whitewash because it is the very system itself that all these political functionaries are trying to defend which bears responsibility for this event and its impact on history 
hiring the people who played minor supporting roles in the  bloodbath to identify its architects and actors may yield a few sacrificial scapegoats like cheney and some generals but the top of the line power structure will remain solidly in place hidden from view and utterly in control of world events 
that trump has surrounded himself with the tainted players who have carried out all these wars for israel augurs for a dark future in which the militarization of america will further shrink individual rights and the harsh crackdown on legitimate dissent  which will soon be banned  plainly signals the end of free speech as we have known it in the united states 
recall thomas jeffersons dictum freedom of the press cannot be limited without being lost today it is long gone the press prints only what the government allows it to print 
for trump to hire such rancid refugees from the bush administration means that he wont be investigating  instead he will be crafting a new more realistic coverup that lambastes saudi renegades and totally omits the overwhelming presence of israeli jews in all aspects of the tragedy  the same presence that now dominates the us government and its criminal activities throughout the world 
preemptive war is criminal activity in case you didnt know the us is practicing it everywhere under the cynical guise of fighting terror which it itself creates by hiring thugs from around the world to fit into the proper terror slots and become believable enemies for the press to vilify and our military to bomb 
the us has literally slaughtered millions of people around the world at the behest of a small group of mostly jewish men and the gentiles they have bought who control not only virtually all the money of the people in the world but also control their thoughts as a result 
mayor giuliani ran the command post in building  you remember building  that building that was knocked down by not being hit by an airplane giuliani knows everything that happened and who did what 
eisenberg one of the worlds foremost financiers was the head of the new york port authority who leased the twin towers to silverstein silverstein who spoke frequently with top israeli leaders wound up with  billion 
the question with regard to trumps integrity kind of splits down the middle since he seems to have a genuine desire to succeed and restore the peace but he is indebted to forces far larger than himself which he is now trying to placate by surrounding himself with the traditional pseudo republican goons like gingrich and romney 
if only they were genuine republicans it wouldnt be so bad but theyre poseurs all ultimately working for the rockefellers and the rothschilds 
business as usual in the jewish american empire gnawing on the fatted calf while   bleeds 
trumps choices reveal a desire to continue the swashbuckling sadism of the bush administration throughout his campaign i always shuddered when trump would proclaim that we needed a stronger military and i thought tell that to the people beneath the bombs because they want no part of any of this 
as a newspaper blows trivial events into earthshaking issues so politicians identify all manner of enemies that demonstrate the desperate need for them to be elected 
like the boston marathon bombing that turned a mercenary drill into a region wide suspension of freedom of movement the worst story possible is presented even as inconvenient facts are left behind 
think about the atrocities and false flag shockers that have been foisted on us since  statistics reveal that more than  of significant terror incidents began life as fbi sting operations manipulating low iq bigmouths into capital crimes 
why is it the cops can commit crimes against the people but the people cant commit crimes against the cops this is not the kind of freedom we thought wed get while growing up 
trump certainly is not addressing any of these issues and a trump administration will merely continue the clumsy depredations and smokescreen lies that have exemplified the utterly corrupt and criminal nature of the united states as it is run by jews bankers holed up in the city of london and wreaking havoc throughout the world by their control of everyones money 
what is really needed is a full accounting of what the jews have done to the united states and restitution to united states citizens over moneys illegally stolen by the federal reserve corporation to be taken from its stockholders immediately 
of course this is impossible because the jews own the government and all the corrupt minions within it one word from them and youre out of a job 
the avaricious jews are really only a reflection of the darker side of humanity like good sociopaths they learned everything they know by mimicking others and have become better than everyone else at what they do simply by practice and cooperation 
they have never once considered that the fate of the world ultimately depends on treating everyone in the world as members of your own family even as that becomes impossible on a continent overrun by hungry savages who were put there by these very same sadists who control the united states and its fearsome war machine

Steve Watson,competing theories on why the fbi reopened the hillary email server investigation,"eight ways to strengthen our democracy beyond voting the strength of our civic life depends on what we do outside elections by chuck collins   chuck collins 
throughout this trying election season weve been told how much is at stake with our vote but the success of any democracy depends on continuing to pay attention long after we cast our ballots 
so lets pledge to strengthen our democracy with a few resolutions to focus our intentions and keep us moving forward over the next four years 
 change your media diet  
way too much ink airtime and mental real estate has been consumed by the horserace reporting on electionsits all about whos winning and losing so unplug from the talk shows that interview pollsters and engage in partisan bickering all day find the commentators and independent media outlets that strengthen our civic life 
 turn off corporate media 
this election has been very profitable for big media corporations but bad for our democracy as cbs chairman les moonves remarked  man who would have expected the ride were all having right now the moneys rolling in and this is fun 
our differences have been compounded by media reports that amplify the loudest and most partisan utterances election coverage this year has encouraged us to view one another as cartoon caricatures not neighbors 
 reject the consumer mentality in elections  
were encouraged to view national elections like consumers buying a car but presidential elections can make most of us feel like spectators not participants election day is a small part of our real democracythink of voting as a tiny fraction of your civic life 
 make your voice heard  
pledge to communicate with your elected officials all year round not just when they want your vote call write email and attend community forums when a politician hears from a dozen constituents with the same concern it matters 
a few resolutions must address our polarized political atmosphere the only way to break through this is by connecting with people we dont always agree with 
for instance the liberal california sociologist arlie hochschild spent five years interviewing conservative tea party activists in louisiana making friends and asking deep questions she urges us all to scale the empathy wall and learn each others stories 
heres a few easy ways to get started 
try a social media fast 
social media is amazing but it mostly serves as an echo chamber to reinforce our existing views its not a substitute for talking to people asking questions and learning why people support certain policies 
 practice the art of civil discourse  
find ways to meet others facetoface to engage in conversations not soapbox speeches and debates look at the  living room conversation  movement that brings people together across political divisions their goal is to encourage authentic respectful conversations to strengthen relationships and advance understanding of the challenges opportunities and solutions before us 
finally other resolutions should focus on changing our polarizing election system 
 eliminate the wealth primary  
long before voters cast their ballots in a primary big money donors have winnowed the field and selected who will stand for election people all across the political spectrum agree that we need fundamental campaign finance reform to reduce the influence of big money including the repeal of citizens united  
 break the twoparty duopoly  
a growing number of voters have declared independence from the two major parties so why do we allow other voices and perspectives to be excluded from presidential debates our democracy would benefit if we had real choices outside the two major parties as they do in most other countries in the world 
the strength of our civic life depends on what we do outside elections and especially after the deeply toxic experience of  we all need to step up to protect our real democracy from those who profit from division

Corbett,interview   larken rose on the immorality of voting,"corbettreportcom november   
in douglas adams so long and thanks for all the fish  there is a scene where a spaceship lands on earth and a robot emerges from the craft proclaiming that i come in peace and exhorting the earthlings to take me to your lizard the storys protagonist arthur dent has this strange request explained to him by his friend ford prefect an experienced galactic hitchhiker 
it comes from a very ancient democracy you see 
you mean it comes from a world of lizards 
no said ford who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been having finally had the coffee forced down him nothing so simple nothing anything like so straightforward on its world the people are people the leaders are lizards the people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people 
odd said arthur i thought you said it was a democracy 
i did said ford it is 
so said arthur hoping he wasnt sounding ridiculously obtuse why dont the people get rid of the lizards 
it honestly doesnt occur to them said ford theyve all got the vote so they all pretty much assume that the government theyve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want 
you mean they actually vote for the lizards 
oh yes said ford with a shrug of course 
but said arthur going for the big one again why 
because if they didnt vote for a lizard said ford the wrong lizard might get in got any gin 
what 
i said said ford with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice have you got any gin 
ill look tell me about the lizards 
ford shrugged again 
some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them he said theyre completely wrong of course completely and utterly wrong but someones got to say it 
if only this was a joke but here we are on the verge of a contest between the two least respected most distrusted candidates to run for office in modern political history and some people say these lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them 
if there is any solace at all in this years selection cycle it is that as the corbett report has been pointing out since the very day of its inception there is absolutely nothing at stake here the presidential figureheads are mere puppets false fronts for the shadow government and deep state that commands and controls the military economic and diplomatic machinery of the usled world empire 
do you really think the oligarchs put their entire system up on the chopping block every four years hoping against hope that the public doesnt use the dreaded ballot box to vote them out of power dashing decades or centuries of carefully cultivated enslavement with pencils and touchscreens just in case anyone dislikes rhetorical questions let me answer that one for you no no they do not 
but dont take my word for it take emma goldman as shes been reputed to have said and if she didnt feel free to tell other people that i said it if voting changed anything theyd make it illegal 
or take hl mencken who in his usual inimitable fashion quipped  
the stateor to make the matter more concrete the governmentconsists of a gang of men exactly like you and me they have taking one with another no special talent for the business of government they have only a talent for getting and holding office their principal device to that end is to search out groups who pant and pine for something they cant get and to promise to give it to them nine times out of ten that promise is worth nothing the tenth time it is made good by looting a to satisfy b in other words government is a broker in pillage and every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods 
or take lysander spooner who wrote  
the principle that the majority have a right to rule the minority practically resolves all government into a mere contest between two bodies of men as to which of them shall be masters and which of them slaves a contest that  however bloody  can in the nature of things never be finally closed so long as man refuses to be a slave 
or wendy mcelroy who reminds us that 
voting is not an act of political freedom it is an act of political conformity those who refuse to vote are not expressing silence they are screaming in the politicians ear you do not represent me this is not a process in which my voice matters i do not believe you 
yes voting is worse than a dead end its less effective than bashing your head against a wall in a vain attempt to cure your headache its more pathetic than allowing the oligarchs into your kitchen and then begging for a scrap of food from your own table it is evil immoral and contemptible it is the act of a slave who has internalized that slavery so thoroughly that he wants to ensure that everyone around him is enslaved too 
but as i pointed out in yesterdays conversation with larken rose if there is any bright spot in all of this it is that your vote doesnt matter anyway and will not change anything at all it will not even register as a protest as some would like to believe since the elections are rigged and the votes arent counted 
so if you are so inclined knock yourself out cast a ballot but instead of sitting back and feeling good about yourself for having done this senseless meaningless and immoral act can we at least agree to use the next  days to do something actually productive i leave it entirely up to you how to interpret the phrase actually productive but if youd allow me to offer some humble suggestions 
find join or create a community organization or freedom cell with a focus on fostering economic connections and social ties with people in your geographical area 
find join or create a community currency  community trading program or community exchange to foster agoristic connection between yourself and others in your area 
commit to spending a certain amount of time each week spreading awareness about the banking oligarchy  false flag terrorism  gmo crops  or any subject you feel strongly about either offline or online using the work of others or by starting your own blog newsletter or community meet up group 
learn about gardening  canning appliance repair d printing  monetary theory  or any subject that you think will be handy in the event of a government collapse or even if the government doesnt collapse 
read more books spend less time arguing with people online and more time making friends at the local coffee shop learn a new skill and teach it to someone else 
in short do all of the million things that have nothing whatsoever to do with the phony baloney political charade exemplified by national selection day because if all you ever do is tick a box in a voting booth and sit back to see who wins the rigged sporting event you probably believe the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to you",corbettreport.com,Fake,english,14.592450262994053,10.703235802372705,51,8,6780,1228,4.480456026058632,1228.0,-0.3350783918572136,-0.3899286096724409,1.005690480226249,1.147157158771403,-0.6006937127487897,1.1855746622687566,0.001628664495114,0.0,0.000814332247557,0,0,0.0,0.0026716930154785,-0.9641,0.107,0.115,0.778,Negative,Very Strong

five filipino fishermen who were released after being held hostage by somali pirates for nearly five years have reunited with their families 
the seafarers arrived at the airport in the philippine capital manila on friday 
i am so happy this is what i had been praying for every night said arnel balbero  as he was embraced by his four siblings at the airport 
just to be with my family even if we have nothing even if we have only little to eat i am already happy he said 
his sister lilia trembled at the sight of her brother its like a miracle we never lost hope he would be freed she said 
the filipinos were among  freed hostages from cambodia china taiwan indonesia and vietnam who were freed on october  the  hostages plus three others made up the crew of naham  which was seized south of the seychelles in march  
the captain of their omaniflagged but taiwaneseowned vessel died during the hijacking and two other crew members succumbed to illness in captivity 
recounting memories 
balberos cousin and fellow exhostage elmer said the somali pirates had cared little about the health of their captives 
we asked the pirates for medicine but they did not give us any instead they said where is your money said elmer 
the captives also said they suffered beatings at the hands of the pirates 
in our first week they called it our introduction they used bamboo to beat us arnel said 
to survive the filipinos did chores for their captors washing their clothes and even their weapons 
we took it as a chance to also wash we couldnt take a bath often because they only gave us a liter of water each day arnel said 
hugging his two teenage daughters elmer said it was thoughts of seeing his family again that kept him going during his captivity 
taiwans foreign ministry said the men were freed after a ransom was paid by the ships owner as well as groups contracted to negotiate with the pirates taiwanese media reported 
john steed who works with the hostage support partnership said the local community and tribal elders were involved in the difficult situation 
these are poor fishermen the ship had no value they had no insurance and of course governments dont want to be involved in these sort of negotiations either he said sailors who had been held hostage by pirates for more than four years stand for a group photograph as they prepare to board an airplane after being released in galkayo somalia october   photo by ap

hillary clintons top advisers blame fbi director james comey for the democrats bruising loss to presidentelect donald trump 
navin nayak the head of the clinton campaigns opinion research division sent an email to senior staffers thursday outlining early signals as to why the candidate lost the november  presidential election politico reported on friday 
we believe that we lost this election in the last week said nayaks email which was published by politico  comeys letter in the last  days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among collegeeducated white voters  particularly in the suburbs 
we also think comeys nd letter which was intended to absolve sec clinton actually helped to bolster trumps turnout he continued 
the letter also highlighted several other challenges the clinton team faced throughout the campaign including a desire for change after two terms by a democratic president and the reluctance of some americans to vote for a female candidate hillary clinton makes a concession speech after being defeated by donald trump in new york on november   photo by afp 
despite those challenges nayak said clinton was on course to win until the last week when everything changed and the momentum began to shift in favor of trump 
voters who decided in the last week broke for trump by a larger margin  these numbers were even more exaggerated in the key battleground states he said 
the fbi director angered democrats late in october by announcing in a letter to congress that the agency had uncovered new emails connected to the clinton email investigation 
just over a week later comey notified congress that clinton would not face charges over the newly discovered messages 
nayak said comeys letters encouraged trump supporters and depressed the turnout for clinton on election day 
there is no question that a week from election day sec clinton was poised for a historic win in the end less than k votes out of tens of millions cast on election day made the difference in this race he wrote 
in the end nayak concluded late breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome

Alex Ansary,russiaus plutonium deal no longer in effect,"fbi releases clinton foundation investigation records  
daily caller 
the fbi on tuesday released documents related to a nowclosed federal investigation of an alleged paytoplay scheme involving bill clinton and the clinton foundation 
the documents which are heavily redacted regard the investigation of clintons lastminute pardon of marc rich a billionaire fugitive who was wanted in the us for tax evasion 
the jan   pardon sparked the last controversy to befall the scandalplagued clinton administration richs exwife denise donated more than  million to various clinton and democratic entities including the democratic national committee hillary clintons new york senate campaign and the clinton foundation 
the release provides little in the way of information that has not already been publicized but the dump is noteworthy for two reasons it reminds voters that the clinton white house and clinton foundation were embroiled in an investigation concerning paytoplay allegations the clinton foundation is reportedly being investigated at the present by multiple fbi field offices 
it also comes as the fbi is locked in a bitter standoff with the clinton foundation and the justice department over fbi director james comeys handling of the hillary clinton email investigation 
the newlyreleased files include one entry which shows that the required pardon standards and procedures were not followed prior to the rich pardon 
roger adams the us pardon attorney at the time testified to congress in feb  that none of the regular procedures were followed ahead of the rich reprieve 
former attorney general eric holder is also mentioned in the file it cites holders testimony that he was the only person who worked at doj  he was deputy attorney general at the time  about the rich pardon from the fbis clinton foundation investigation files 
a grand jury was convened to weigh the merits of the case but no indictments were handed down ironically the law enforcement official who closed the case was fbi director comey he served as deputy attorney general in the george w bush administration 
the fbis website suggests that more clinton foundation investigation records could be coming in the future 
this initial release consists of material from the fbis files related to the william j clinton foundation  a nonprofit c organization the site reads the bulk of these records come from a  fbi investigation into the pardon of marc rich  aka marcell david reich by president clinton in  it was closed in  
the fbi did not respond to a request for more information on future releases 
update clinton campaign press secretary brian fallon questioned the release 
the fbi issued a statement late tuesday afternoon saying that the file was released in response to a foia request 
the fbis records management division receives thousands of foia requests annually which are processed on a first in first out fifo basis the statement reads

a chronicle analysis of federal election commission data provided by the center for responsive politics shows donald trump raising a tiny fraction of the campaign money that the previous two republican nominees mitt romney and john mccain drew from highereducation professionals over comparable time periods 
across higher education donations in congressional and senate races showed a ratio of democratic to republican giving similar to that of the two previous presidentialcampaign cycles but support for mr trump stood at less than  percent of what senator mccain raised from highered professionals and around  percent of the donations that mr romney pulled in over the same time period once the figures were adjusted for inflation

samar pahwa,top  pet care tips,"keywords election   rigged election  voting  voting errors  voting machines malfunction voting machines malfunction 
this is just a straight up fact especially since many of our voting machines are so antiquated as you vote this year you should watch out for these glitches sometimes the votes appear to be flipped as in a voter intends to vote for candidate a but candidate bs name is selected on the screen 
when this happens it is known as vote flipping and is supposed to only happen rarely with millions of votes cast there have supposedly only been a few hundred reports of vote flipping every year for the past decade these are the ones reported so you do wonder whether this happens unnoticed much more often im just saying im seeing reports of this specifically happening all around the country so cast your vote and double check check your ballot after you cast your vote and if it happens to you call on a poll worker to help get it fixed remember voting machine malfunctions do happen 
there are reports of this happening already in north carolina texas and nevada with machines vote flipping in the last couple weeks 
you have to remember that the majority of the machines in use today predate the iphone or the ipad and most of them use technology from the late s lawrence norden a voting technology expert at the brennan center for justice in new york told time as these machines age you start to have hardware issues 
one problem that also occurs on older machines is the glue that attaches the screen to the machine breaks down and you can get alignment issues as well poll workers and technicians need to reset the machines regularly to ensure the buttons are lined up right in other cases it can just be a user error because no one uses the type of equipment used at the voting centers on a regular basis 
in texas voters reported attempting to vote a straight republican ticket but found the clintonkaine ticket selected instead this can be found specifically in voting districts where they use the old rotarystyle voting machine 
if you select one candidate and the other appears on the screen or if youre looking at the summary screen and it just isnt right voters should notify the poll workers they can cancel out your session so you can do it over poll from presstvcom ",naturalnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,2.2264292892673696,18,4,2294,405,4.6345679012345675,405.0,-1.3440546901789416,-1.141531470845462,-0.1811780292328979,-0.1430441314511039,-0.448600405802203,-0.1347910280083499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.4854,0.043,0.038,0.919,Positive,Moderate
Roosh Valizadeh,how the camp of the saints predicted the migrant destruction of europe,"why is obama threatening russia with world war  right before the election   october th  
it sure seems like an odd time to be provoking a war with russia as i write this we stand just a little bit more than three weeks away from one of the most pivotal elections in us history and barack obama has chosen this moment to strongly threaten the russians as i wrote about on friday  reuters is reporting that obama is contemplating direct us military action against syrian military targets and the russians have already indicated that any assault on syrian forces would be considered an attack on themselves the rapidly deteriorating crisis in syria has already caused tensions with russia to rise to the highest level since the end of the cold war but now obama is adding fuel to the fire by publicly considering an unprecedented cyber covert action against russia apparently obama believes that russian hackers are interfering in the election and so he wants payback the following comes from an nbc news article entitled  cia prepping for possible cyber strike against russia  
the obama administration is contemplating an unprecedented cyber covert action against russia in retaliation for alleged russian interference in the american presidential election  us intelligence officials told nbc news 
current and former officials with direct knowledge of the situation say the cia has been asked to deliver options to the white house for a wideranging clandestine cyber operation designed to harass and embarrass the kremlin leadership 
the sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the cia was considering but said the agency had already begun opening cyber doors selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation  
somebody should tell obama that he is not playing a video game a cyber attack is considered to be an act of war and the russians would inevitably retaliate and considering how exceedingly vulnerable our cyber infrastructure is i dont know if that is something that we want to invite 
at the end of last week vice president joe biden also publicly threatened the russians  
on friday vice president joe biden met meet the press host chuck todd for an interview that has raised serious concern in russia 
without bothering to question the authenticity of the claims todd took the allegations of russian hacking at face value opening his interview with a loaded question why havent we sent a message yet to putin 
after a moment of stunned silence biden responded were sending a message we have the capacity to do it and it will be at the time of our choosing and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact 
when todd asked if the public will know a message was sent biden replied hope not 
the russians firmly deny that they had any involvement in the hacking and so far the obama administration has not publicly produced any firm evidence that the russians were behind it 
perhaps the obama administration privately has some evidence but at this point they have not shown that evidence to the american public 
so for joe biden to be making these sorts of threats is a very dangerous thing the russians are taking these threats very seriously and they are preparing to protect their interests  
the threats directed against moscow and our states leadership are unprecedented because they are voiced at the level of the us vice president 
to the backdrop of this aggressive unpredictable line we must take measures to protect our interests to hedge risks a kremlin spokesman said according to ria novosti news agency 
here in the united states most people dont even realize that we could be on the verge of a major conflict with russia 
but over in russia things are completely different talk of war is everywhere and the potential for war is the number one topic in the russian media right now just check out some of the recent russian media headlines about the conflict between our two nations 
 in contrast to clinton trump has no appetite for war with russia  
and one russian television network recently instructed their viewers to locate the nearest bomb shelter in case a nuclear war between the united states and russia suddenly erupts 
a terrifying russian television broadcast explicitly told civilians to find out where their nearest bomb shelter is and repeatedly asked viewers if they were ready for nuclear war 
one apocalyptic broadcast told viewers on moscows stateowned tv channel ntv if it should one day happen every one of you should know where the nearest bomb shelter is its best to find out now 
i dont believe that the russians are crazy to be thinking that a war might be coming 
to me it almost seems as though obama wants one 
could it be possible that a conflict with russia will be used to alter change or influence the upcoming election in november 
the truth is that it isnt going to take much for the shooting to begin if obama orders airstrikes against syrian forces the russians have said that they will shoot back  
ash carter has threatened russia with consequences after blowing up the ceasefire the pentagon  supported by the joint chiefs of staff  now is peddling potential strikes on syrias air force to punish the regime for what the pentagon actually did blow up the ceasefire one cant make this stuff up 
majorgeneral igor konashenkov russias defense ministry spokesman sent a swift message to our colleagues in washington think twice if you believe you can get away with launching a shadow hot war against russia russia will target any stealthunidentified aircraft attacking syrian government targets  and they will be shot down

i discussed the potential for war with russia in my latest video  hopefully cooler heads will prevail and war with russia will be put off 
but without a doubt the crisis in syria is not going to be resolved any time soon because it is one giant mess most people dont realize that the syrian civil war has essentially been a proxy war between sunni islam and shia islam from the very beginning jihadist rebels that are being armed and funded by saudi arabia and turkey are fighting hezbollah troops that are being armed and funded by iran and now turkish forces have invaded northern syria and this threatens to cause a fullblown war to erupt between turkey and the syrian kurds of course isis is right in the middle of everything causing havoc blowing stuff up and beheading anyone that doesnt believe in their radical version of sunni islam 
it is absolutely insane that the united states and russia could potentially go to war because of this conflict both sides are determined to show the other how tough they are and one false move could set off a spiral of events from which they may be no recovery 
the american people very foolishly elected barack obama twice but up until now the consequences have not been quite as dire as many had been projecting

additionally this lowlife ploy by the progressive liberal democrats is disgusting and changes nothing for many of us jfk was having an ongoing affair with marilyn monroe and im sure his secret service agents could have repeated some rather spicy language in which he described their sexual sessions but you know what neither jfks secret service agents nor the mainstream media said anything about the affair much less jfks private conversations about it because they had dignity respect for the office of potus and respect for jfk any one of those things alone should be enough to keep despicable actions of the democrats and the mainstream media from happening around the whole institution of the potus including the potential potus candidates however we see that neither the democrats nor the mainstream media have any honor truth or journalistic integrity remaining 
general george s patton and prime minister winston churchill were both as crude as they come in private and often in public but they got the job done when they were called upon maybe you dont consider donald trump in the same ranks as the above three men maybe you dont think donald trump can get the job done either way i couldnt care less what i do care about is the poor state of our country the damage that barack obama  the democrats have done and the damage that hillary clinton is sure to do for petes sake look at the shell of a city that used to be detroit mi look at chicago with doubledigit murders just about every week if you want the us to look like these longtime democratrun cities by all means vote for hillary clinton if not then the only other viable option is donald trump

former secretary of state hillary clinton arranged a  million donation from moroccan king mohammed vi to her familys charity in  in return for the clinton global initiative hosting its international meeting in the north african muslim nation according to an email made public thursday by wikileaks 
the moroccan monarchs funds went to the clinton foundations endowment and to cgi the jan   email was included in wikileaks latest batch of communications to and from clintons presidential campaign chairman john podesta 
the email from huma abedin clintons deputy chief of staff at the state department was addressed to podesta and campaign manager robby mook hillary clinton was a director of the foundation at the time 
singapore and hong kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the cgi meeting in their countries but the north african nation ultimately hosted it in a fivestar hotel in marrakesh morocco in  abedin told podesta and mook that morocco was not cgis first choice 
the actual meeting was paid for by ocp the moroccangovernmentowned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations clinton vigorously supported the moroccan king when she was secretary of state and the usfinanced exportimport bank gave ocp a  million loan guarantee during her tenure as secretary of state 
the mining company also contributed between  million to  million to the clinton foundation according to the charitys web siteabedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss hillary clinton created this mess and she knows it she told podesta and mookshe said the moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss this was hrcs idea our office approached the moroccans and they  percent believe they are doing this at her request the king has personally committed approx  million both for the endowment and to support the meeting hrc stands for hillary rodham clinton 
abedin said clintons attendance at the cgi event was a condition of the  million contribution just to give you some context the condition upon which the moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation if hrc was not part if it meeting was a nonstarter abedin said 
politico in  reported that clinton was seen by rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the obama administration rabat is the capital of morocco 
the robert f kennedy center for justice charged ocp with serious human rights violations including exploitation of workers by not adequately compensating the impoverished people who live there 
mohamed yeslem beisat the washington envoy for the polisaro front as reported by almonitor a middle east news site in  that ocp is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation  it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past  years 
polisaro claims to lead a moroccan governmentinexile based in tindouf algeria 
theyre doing this because they know hillary has some chances of being president of the united states and they want her to support their brutal occupation of western sahara beisat charged 
the moroccan firm mines phosphates human rights critics have called ocps mining product blood phosphates appropriating the term blood diamonds for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers 
ocp is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the clinton foundation the foundation accepted a  million pledge from lukas lundin who owns mining and oil drilling operations in north africa and in the congo related clinton foundation got m from blood minerals firm 
ocp retained the law firm of covington  burling one of washingtons lobbying giants paying the firm  million in fees from  to  
stuart eizenstat a former white house domestic policy chief under president carter and an influential democratic party insider was the main lobbyist for the mining firm he was also president bill clintons ambassador to the european union a deputy secretary of the treasury and under secretary at the department of commerce 
eizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at commerce where he worked in the international trade administration 
hillary clinton officially visited morocco twice in november  and in february  meeting with the king on both occasions the two also met in new york in december  where it was believed the two discussed moroccos bid to host the cgi meeting and the kings  million donation 
the moroccan world news described the meeting as showing renewed friendship between the royal family and the clinton family as well as hillary clintons esteem for morocco and its people 
abedin warned both campaign executives that if cgi decided to renege on the agreement it would hurt clintons relationship with the king it will break a lot of china to back out now she wrote

Ron Yahaloms,natural remedies that will help you get rid of blackheads quickly,"what we all should be doing first thing in the morning a simple cheap and effective way to jump start your metabolism weight loss and improve your health 
what if i told you that by doing this every day making it part of your morning routine just like brushing your teeth would help you to lose weight flush out toxins hydrate your body and skin improve brain function give you more energy and decrease your appetite would you do it 
drinking water upon rising in the morning can have huge health benefits some people call it water therapy and has its origination in ayurvedic medicine it is purported to help with numerous diseases such as cancer asthma high blood pressure arthritis diabetes and migraines 
to reap the benefits drink the water upon waking ideally  minutes before you eat and make it part of your morning routine most us are walking around in a dehydrated state so start your day off the right way 
ideally filtered water that is void of chemicals and fluoride is best i personally like the berkey filter system as this is affordable for many instead of a whole house system most water pitchers are ineffective for removing most of the chemicals in our water but there are a couple good ones out there such as the clearly filtered pitcher but even if you dont have a water filter system it does not mean you should not drink up 
for most people  oz of water in the morning is the right amount others say to drink double this amount this may be a lot of water to consume for most people first thing in the morning my suggestion would be to start out with  oz and slowly work your way up to the higher amount and see how you feel moderation is key as too little or too much water is never a good thing 
the  glasses filled with  oz of water is a myth and no science behind this reasoning another simple rule is to divide your body weight in half and drink this amount in ounces but if you are a large person this may feel like you are spending your day drinking water 
instead focus on getting that glass of water first thing in the day and then add in water herbal teas fruits and vegetables during the day if your urine is very pale yellow throughout the day then you are hydrated if it is a bright yellow to orange drink up riboflavin a b vitamin can make your urine a bright yellow benefits to drinking water first thing in the morning it can jump start your metabolism 
it can increase your metabolism by  for the first  minutes after consuming that glass of water another study showed that it can increase your metabolic rate by  for the next  minutes after the water is consumed hydration this is more important that you think when dehydrated we may experience brain fog lack of energy and metal clarity hydrating in the morning can increase the flow of oxygen which is energizing hydrating will also help the skin to look younger flushes out toxins 
support your kidneys by helping them to flush out toxins and give your body the water it needs first thing in the am speed up the detox process by adding a tablespoon of lemon juice to your morning water this is best done prior to brushing your teeth in the morning as the film on your teeth will protect the enamel from the acidity in the lemon juice support brain health 
your brain tissue is  water not having enough water can make you feel tired drained and can cause mood swings prevent you from overeating just by drinking water you feel full studies show that those who consume water before every meal lost an average of  pounds over a threemonth period thats with no dieting not changing your eating habitsjust adding in water less colds and flu 
staying hydrated helps to maintain the health of your lymphatic system which also affects how your body fights off infection 
if you are looking for a simple cheap and effective way to improve your health and stimulate weight loss then this is it

Sean Colarossi,trump kicks africanamerican protester out of north carolina rally calls him a thug,"by rmuse    pm if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophic   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
it may be the understatement of the year to say the republican party is on the verge of a fullon civil war and it may be obvious to many americans that the blame for the interparty discord is its standard bearer donald j trump however much trumps candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of trumps reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellionminded trump supporters the real instigators are the koch brothers 
although the oil magnates were never on the trump bandwagon they are responsible for the trump loyalists within the gop who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nations political system and indeed the workings of government itself the tea party caucus an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former house speaker john a boehner out of congress morphed into the inaptly named freedom caucus that has embraced trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isnt solely to put current speaker paul ryan out of a job although that is high on the trump supporters todo list 
as noted in wednesdays new york times  mr trumps supporters said they were determined to harness the antiestablishment energy that mr trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the republican leadership in congress  a target many of them seemeager to take down  
the rightwing extremist that actually  took down  former house majority leader eric cantor conservative extremist and house freedom caucus member david brat issued a warning to establishment republicans 
 theres a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to dc leadership comes and smacks our guy thats where youre going to put down a marker really and the american people are just scratching their head saying really thats rich  
brat has been a thorn in the establishments side since paul ryan became speaker and he joins a dangerous number of  real conservatives  who cannot understand or comport with ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after hillary clinton 
donald trump and a few of his  senior aides  are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending trump in fact besides assailing ryan for not sticking by trump it is reported that trump said privately that ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the trump candidacy and during an interview with reuters he complained that  the people are very angry with the leadership of this party because this is an election that we will win  percent if we had support from the top  win or lose there is going to be a major bloodletting after the election and the establishment although powerful may face a herculean task to save the party 
this impending conflict within the gop has been brewing longer than donald trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced antiestablishment devotee to run his campaign the chairman of breitbart news stephen bannon had made it one of his primary goals to get paul ryan out as house speaker because he is not a true conservative intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uberconservative paradise and uberconservative is just a different way of saying a  nongovernment  according to the koch brothers vision of american libertarianism dont believe it 
two groups closely aligned with the koch brothers heritage action for america and freedomworks  have been pushing republicans as a party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the partys decisions something establishment types are resisting 
over the past few days leaders of both koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next or new speaker of the house something typically occurring directly after the general election in november regardless the outcome 
according to the chief executive of heritage action michael needham there is going to be hell to pay for establishment republicans if they dont bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the kochs and heavily courted by donald trump mr needham said 
 if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophe  
another conservative extremist house freedom caucus member and ardent donald trump supporter echoed needhams sentiment and said  you cant ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle  
the dilemma for republicans after the election no matter the outcome is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party that doesnt seem likely because if trump loses big or small the extremists will unleash whatever level of hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of trumps more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump if trump wins the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on november  it will not be the end of hostilities among republicans 
the republican party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the united states or shutting down the government as a show of anger after four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative and the past yearandahalf of incitement by donald trump the republican party faces a serious threat to its longterm survival it is a threat that began about six years ago when the koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that donald trump took advantage of to seize control of the republican party",politicususa.com,Real,english,100.0,87.98166551253078,82,13,6004,1011,4.898120672601385,1011.0,0.6127478277783491,0.5495749667938356,0.800382864680039,0.8069704273275584,-0.1884996672552482,0.8374344984897383,0.0039564787339268,0.0,0.0009891196834817,0,3,0.0,0.0091015454083199,0.977,0.127,0.098,0.775,Positive,Very Strong

whether or not youre a basketball fan youre going to love this story about a bold new humanitarian initiative from the nba in order to help alleviate the refugee crisis in europe the league is housing syrian refugees on whichever half of the court isnt being played on during the game 
now thats making a difference way to go nba 
since the syrian civil war began in  millions of syrians have been displaced but thanks to the generosity of the nba some of them will now find a new home right around the threepoint line on the half of the court that isnt being played on at that time while players occupy one half of the court syrian refugees will have a safe and welcoming space on the other half to reassemble their lives until the ball changes possession and they are shuttled to the opposite end 
wow what a beautiful gesture from the nba with  courts across the country and  games in the  season the league is set to provide housing that periodically oscillates from one half of the court to the other for several thousand syrian refugees this is huge 
in contrast to europes notoriously overcrowded refugee camps the nbas half courts are big enough to comfortably house at least five families around the perimeter and one or two in the paint the refugees also have access to any snack vendors who happen to be milling about the crowd near whichever half of the court theyre on at the time 
of course its a new program and its not perfect there have been several incidents in which refugees have collided with players after failing to get to the other half of the court in time and last night an yearold syrian girl had to be treated for minor injuries after lebron james dunked on her during a fast break 
still according to nba commissioner adam silver the program is a huge step up from the refugee camps abroad 
the syrian refugee crisis is only getting worse meanwhile weve got this half of the court that isnt being played on just collecting dust waiting to be put to good use said silver adding that he felt the league had a moral responsibility to harbor the refugees if we can help these people by sheltering them on one side of the court until theres a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half as soon as theres a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half until theres a change in possession then we have an obligation to do that 
its refreshing to see a major organization like the nba reaching out to a group of people who so desperately need our help right now faith in humanity restored",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,84,16,2556,466,4.459227467811159,466.0,0.6738979064645144,1.1132771126736014,-0.1118602518191002,-0.0474156032572121,-0.6216442178404996,-0.0369267423377503,0.0042918454935622,0.0,0.0,0,2,0.0,0.0106307579905541,0.9844,0.126,0.069,0.806,Positive,Very Strong
admin,mission accomplished rt crew finds refugees still at jungle camp despite successful eviction,"when people ask me about my current position fighting in the culture war years after starting my writing career with bang books i simply say i just wanted to get laid from these hedonistic beginnings opened a path that i find myself in today a reviewer of my new book free speech isnt free also noticed this transformation
ive been following the red pill community for a a few years now the members therein have been engaging in some of the most relevant conversations anywhere on the net roosh is one ive only recently become familiar with as i tend to appreciate and relate more to the more traditionalist members like vox day dalrock and roissy
what is so fascinating about guys like roosh is how their journey to acquire more sex and attention from highly attractive women has led them stumbling across uncomfortable truths about the world that we men of the west find ourselves living in
this book is a very straightforward account of an encounter that an iconic red pill pillar had with the traditional media community that exposes a truly shocking level of laziness and corruption on the part of an institution that we are supposed to respect for some reason i remember watching from a social media distance as these events went down and i had no idea just how bad it was
i really admire the stones on this kid and i hope he stays motivated and encourages more people to be bold with the truth which is always unpc im not a fan of lotharios but i appreciate intellectual honesty and bravery i hope rooshs neomasculinity gets legs i really do
how did game serve as the gateway drug simple i kept asking why as if i was an annoying yearold child
why are woman attracted to me when i dance and act like an entertaining clown  why did my father not have to act like a clown to attract my mom why has society changed to encourage women to pursue exciting bad boys and clowns over good men why are institutions like the media and universities pushing women into behaviors which harm them and the family unit why is there a concealed group of elites who seem to control politicians and the most important institutions why are those institutions attacking me for speaking the truth there wasnt only one step from having fun into the nightclub to fighting back against social justice warriors and the media but several steps that had to take place over the past  years my path weaved through sex and gender relations but there are other paths as well which i describe in the  paths to realizing truth  for example minimalism is another point of entry
when you live below your means you begin to see that most people are unnecessarily living above theirs that leads to the conclusion that they were trained to live a life of excess by corporations with the complicit help of a government that wants to keep society in a neverending state of indebtedness and distraction so they ignore everyday injustices while losing any will or desire to fight the establishment the easiest stepping stone out of the truman show is to realize that consumer lifestyles are not the path to happiness and those those who chase material possessions are misguided
many other men have also had a similar path as myself whereby promiscuous sex was a device for understanding the world and deciding on behaviors that are more sustainable to the male soul while not every man gains wisdom during the stage of his life where he wants to sow his royal oats many do and they use that wisdom to devise solutions that can solve our modern problems i do not at all regret engaging in shallow sex with many dozens of women throughout the world because it has developed my thinking into what you read now even though the sex itself wasnt especially memorable and didnt give me much except momentary pleasure
from my current vantage point it really does feel like it was all predetermined as if i was supposed to participate in shallow intimacy in order to arrive at true understanding but that would imply some sort of divine providence whatever the mechanism its clear to me that many of the behaviors and ideas we hold now could be mere waystations for a grander more universal truth whatever individual journey youre a part of i hope well find out soon enough

hawkmo99,comment on this is the man militarized police at standing rock are working for by hawkmo,"posted on october   by claire bernish 
cannon ball nd  on thursday police from no less than five states sporting full riot gear and armed with heavy lethal and nonlethal weaponry pepper spray mace a number of atvs five tanks two helicopters and militaryequipped humvees showed up to tear down an encampment of standing rock sioux water protectors and supporters armed with  nothing 
under orders from the nownotorious morton county sheriffs office this ridiculously heavyhanded standing army came better prepared to do battle than some actual military units fighting overseas 
but the target of their operation  a group of slightly more than  native american water protectors and supporters opposing construction of the dakota access pipeline  never intended to do battle with the armed taxpayerfunded corporatebacked statesponsored aggressors 
reports vary but no less than  people were arrested thursday and  according to witnesses  police marked numbers on arrestees arms and housed them in cementfloored dog kennels  without any padding before they were transported as far away as fargo 
it goes back to concentration camp days asserted ocetisakowin coordinator mekasi camphorinek who along with his mother was marked and detained in a mesh kennel reports the los angeles times  
although thursdays incident remained relatively peaceful for some time with only shouts chants and occasional attempts by water protectors to convince this standing army to examine its motives and reconsider clashes nonetheless broke out  solely because of gratuitous police aggression 
after facing off for a couple hours these militant cops began closing in on the water protectors to shut down the treaty of  camp  in reference to the fort laramie treaty of that year which established a large parcel of land designated exclusively native american territory not to be disturbed by the us government prior to his arrest camphorinek had established the camp stating as cited by indigenous rising  
today the oceti sakowin has enacted eminent domain on dapl lands claiming  treaty rights this is unceded land highway  as of this point is blockaded we will be occupying this land and staying here until this pipeline is permanently stopped we need bodies and we need people who are trained in nonviolent direct action we are still staying nonviolent and we are still staying peaceful 
despite the water protectors commitment to nonviolence the militarized police response went as would be expected  horribly awry 
a prayer circle of elders including several women was interrupted and all were arrested for standing peacefully on the public road stated a press release from indigenous environment network a tipi was erected in the road and was recklessly dismantled despite law enforcement statements that they would merely mark the tipi with a yellow ribbon and ask its owners to retrieve it a group of water protectors was also dragged out of a sweat lodge ceremony erected in the path of the pipeline thrown to the ground and arrested 
claims to the contrary by morton county sheriff kyle kirchmeier aside native american and indigenous water protectors and supporters have refrained from violent acts on the whole preferring instead peaceful prayer vigils and acts of civil disobedience 
no matter how peacefully the opposition acts armed defenders of big oil interests seem determined to brutalize  disrespect and generally incite and inflict violence against those who desire unsullied water for generations to come 
in fact at the beginning of september a private security firm hired by energy transfer partners the company responsible for pipeline construction indiscriminately unleashed vicious attack dogs on water protectors press and supporters  for reasons as yet unknown 
during the savage attack a pregnant woman young girl and many others suffered serious dog bites thanks to the ineptitude of the dogs handlers afterward a warrant for inciting a riot was issued democracy now journalist amy goodman  for doing her job filming events as they happened  though charges were subsequently thrown out 
although etp and some law enforcement officers defended the barbarous actions of the private security mercenaries the guardian now reports that  because the guards lacked proper licensing  they could now face criminal charges on wednesday the morton county sheriffs office made the determination that dog handlers were not properly licensed to do security work in the state of north dakota 
bob frost owner of ohiobased frost kennels told the guardian  all the proper protocols  were already done i pulled my guys out the next day because we werent there to go to war with these protesters 
frost insisted he had cooperated with authorities investigating the incident  but the sheriffs department disagrees seven handlers and dogs were deployed to the scene in early september allegedly in response to reports of trespassers but according to the guardian  police have only managed to identify two people 
the sheriffs department claims frost has not provided necessary information and unnamed security officials cited in the report said that there were no intentions of using the dogs or handlers for security work  however because of the protest events the dogs were deployed as a method of trying to keep the protesters under control 
in a statement cited by the guardian  morton county captain jay gruebele said although lists of security employees have been provided there is no way of confirming whether the list is accurate or if names have been purposely withheld 
water protectors in the meantime are left to deal with absurdly disproportionate state violence  and the altogether unacceptable disrespectful and demeaning insult of being relegated to dog kennels after being arrested for exercising their rights 
as lakota country times editor brandon ecoffey wrote in an editorial thursday 
over the course of the last several months the abuse of detainees by morton county law enforcement has overstepped every boundary guaranteed by the american constitution water protectors have been seen being bound and hooded by police people are being stripped searched and abused within their jail for misdemeanor crimes and police have employed the use of mass surveillance through drones on the protector camps this isnt a war zone this is north dakota dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter please help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks share this",dcclothesline.com,Fake,english,15.763775383339585,2.2264292892673696,88,16,6510,1022,5.318003913894325,1022.0,0.7961980638368451,1.1132771126736014,0.9342561294563048,0.8242149160182601,0.2258839136776942,0.8550821565614858,0.0009784735812133,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0024236463911928,-0.9964,0.093,0.142,0.766,Negative,Very Strong

they are desperate they have received the order from the north to destroy the venezuelan revolution he added

Steve Watson,audio emerges of hillary clinton proposing rigging palestine election,"share this 
there are so many reasons americans should not vote for hillary clinton but one of those reasons is this womans tyrannical plans to strip us of our second amendment rights what many people do not realize is that if she becomes president hillary would ban many of our favorite guns as revealed in a bombshell report that was just leaked 
in a recent wikileaks dump we got an inside glimpse into hillarys diabolical plans to trample all over our gun rights if she becomes president if you thought obamas tyranny with bypassing congress and enacting his will via executive orders was obnoxious it wont hold a candle to this womans plans she blatantly expressed how she would impose massive gun control through executive fiat in a manner more aggressive than obama while chipping away at our second amendment with a myriad of new regulations and gun laws 
while hillary likes to pump us full of crap claiming that lawabiding americans wouldnt be targeted with her tyranny her broad and evasive gun control measures would directly affect americans with no criminal records while having zero impact on the behavior of violent criminals 
one example is hillary calling for the reinstatement of the national assault weapons ban and a prohibition on highcapacity magazines however the result of her assault weapons ban would essentially take up a massive category of firearms including the popular ar while making high capacity magazines illegal to even possess 
we all know these types of regulations are completely ineffective in preventing gun violence since criminals have no regard for laws in the first place and are obviously not going to turn over their guns just because hillary decides to pass a law 
her other constitutionsubverting plan is to pass a law making it legal for victims of gun violence to sue gun manufacturers which would quickly bankrupt these companies however hillarys ultimate goal is to ban all guns in america completely by utilizing the supreme court with her handpicked justice filling antonin scalias vacancy she would have the scotus revisit the district of columbia v heller  ruling if successful the court would eliminate its previous affirmation that it is an individuals constitutional right to keep and bear arms 
when you put all the pieces together hillarys plans for america is nothing short of chilling history taught us the brutal lesson about what happens when a populace is unarmed  images of corpses from nazi concentration camps come to mind add hillarys gungrabbing plan to her dream of turning america into a borderless society and flooding our country with muslim refugees and you have the perfect recipe for disaster

wikileaks is helping president obama keep his  campaign promise  to be the most transparent administration in us history  whether he likes it or not and once again were learning more about the inner sanctum of the administration and its communication practices as fbi director james comey announced friday a new investigation into hillary clintons email scandal has been launched just days before the presidential election comeys move drew fire instantly from the democrats who claim comey is attempting to sway the election in donald trumps favor while many are focused on comeys actions and renewed investigation wikileaks has uncovered what may prove to be a systemic problem of executive branch accountability not merely limited to the former secretary of states emails 
according to former state department official tom nides in a  email to john podesta clinton campaign manager everyone in obamas cabinet and every white house staffer uses their personal email for government business nides should know as he worked under hillary clinton in the state department from  to  according to one source  
while keeping email hidden from the public may seem like no big deal to folks who simply dont care all correspondence which is related to governmental business is the property of the federal government and is supposed to be accessible by anyone wishing to inquire within the archive of records 
the federal records act defines a record as anything regardless of whether it exists in physical digital or electronic form is a record as defined in subsection a shall be binding on all federal agencies this includes all communication of state agents like the potus who work in the executive branch of government as well 
but the obama administration according to nides has long since avoided the federal records act by using private gmail accounts nides wrote podesta and said there is only one thing that needs to be done on this email thing which i am sure nobody wants to do get a state dept career lawyer to go through all the emails and pull the official ones that admission seems to be on the level with what is expected for compliance with the federal records act but it was nides next admission which is the talk of many major media outlets 
nides wrote btw you know as well as i every god damn cabinet officer and wh staff uses their sic gmail account the former department of state employee revealed what many already suspected the obama administration is anything but transparent just ask tom fitton president of judicial watch his organization routinely sues the obama administration in federal court using the freedom of information act as warrant for inquiry and says the administration stonewalls his efforts at every turn fittons organization gave the obama administration a failing grade on transparency and says his administration is even less transparent than when bush was president 
fitton wrote in   there are about  lawsuits  of which are active in federal court and about  judicial watch foia requests that could be affected by mrs clinton and her staffs use of secret email accounts to conduct official government business in our various foia lawsuits our lawyers have informed attorneys for the obama administration that hillary clintons account and any other secret accounts used by state employees should be secured recovered and searched jw actively seeks out those files through official methods using foia and the federal records act but has been met with delay after delay from foia requests to the obama administration 
while the obama administration is on its way out groups like judicial watch arent going anywhere and presumably have all the time in the world to foia their way into digging up those deleted clinton emails as well as securing gmail accounts from the obama administration cabinet and staffers this story is definitely a long way from being over 
its no wonder why so many free thinkers are now questioning the story lines theyre being told with the president and all his men and women hiding their communications within their gmail accounts the truth is never going to be told at least not the real truth and by the time organizations like judicial watch are successful in obtaining the electronic communications records that rightly belong to the people it will be way too late to hold anyone accountable for breaking both the federal records act and the freedom of information act julian assange we salute you thank you for forcing the obama administration to be transparent keep up the valiant work share",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,78.50714911840849,77,13,4843,796,5.052763819095477,796.0,0.4598726310629357,0.5495749667938356,0.493215156369279,0.4699190574638415,-0.0358820476197651,0.492502999814674,0.0025125628140703,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0050088480683324,0.9928,0.102,0.055,0.843,Positive,Very Strong
Bob Unruh,see dems accept foreign cash to disrupt trump rallies,"print fairfax county virginia voter jena jones told wnd and radio america she found this democrat insert included with her absentee ballot among others 
democratic party officials in fairfax county virginia are categorically denying that prodemocrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the fairfax county democratic committee or fcdc 
earlier this week jena and david jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot see images of the materials jena and david say they found at the end of this article also included are two images from democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters 
i found a letter from the governor of virginia asking me to please vote democrat and help keep virginia blue this year jena explained then i got a letter from the fairfax county democratic committee giving me a stepbystep yesandno what i should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot 
in recent days at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots 
after the report was first published and shared on facebook by david jones fairfax county democratic committee executive director frank anderson replied to davids post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained 
these materials were not sent in the same envelope as the ballot the ballot is mailed separately by the office of elections political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots the two envelopes arrived at the same time commented anderson 
that triggered a quick backandforth between david jones and anderson 
i hate to tell you but youre wrong all items came in one envelope jones said 
like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network 
impossible that letter came out of my office we never have access to other peoples ballots replied anderson 
then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to your letters said jones who should i believe you or my lying eyes 
anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot and mailings are sent to those voters to promote democratic party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives 
i am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed we are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots you can believe what you want to believe concluded anderson 
the virginia department of elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response but after seeing reports from wnd and radio america anderson protested the premise of the story 
please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim stated anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the jones account could not be accurate 
he shared a photo sent by state sen scott surovell showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing democratic party advocacy 
in a formal interview fcdc communications adviser bruce neilson told wnd and radio america the jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true 
its not possible said neilson who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local democrats 
voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen he said the activity of voting is also a public record the fairfax county democratic committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot we get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed 
the same day the ballot is mailed our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the fairfax county democratic committee knows to be democratic positions on the ballot said neilson noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax 
listen to the wndradio america interview with bruce neilson 
however he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself 
that material is mailed in a separate envelope labeled with our initials  fcdc  and our return address in fairfax virginia and would be received either the same day perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government neilson said 
its a separate mailing its a separate stamp its a separate envelope its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes he said 
jones is standing by her story  percent as is her husband david says its a very clear memory 
jena opened the envelope that contained her ballot the green sample ballot the twosided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature there was also the return envelope which i signed david said 
the coverage of jenas story has also elicited similar stories from two other fairfax county voters both of them commented on reddit 
i can confirm this i live in herndon va fairfax county and also received these materials in my absentee ballot i thought it was fishy at the time but didnt look into it stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename 
get the hottest most important news stories on the internet  delivered free to your inbox as soon as they break take just  seconds and sign up for wnds email news alerts 
another under the reddit handle nightingalenights said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones david and jena shared last week 
neilson said there is no way the county government which sends out the ballots could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot 
they dont have our materials he said our materials are printed for us by our printer and we have complete control over our materials in our office and they come from our office in our mailing they dont go anywhere else 
its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan democratic materials its never happened before im not aware of it happening now and i dont think that it would happen anywhere in the future neilson said 
there are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in fairfax county leading david jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible he accepts the explanation that the fairfax county democratic committee is not responsible for what he and jena discovered with her ballot 
i understand franks comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots i believe that jones said i think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material i dont see how franks office could be held accountable for whats in the ballot envelope but it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues 
neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true 
i just cant imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail neilson said 
he also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight 
i am an election official on election day i serve in a nonpartisan capacity for our county election office nielson said i can assure you you have democrats and republicans working in the office you have plenty of oversight of the voting process and theres no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot there is no way that happened

Relampago Furioso,relentless media censorship is brining us a fate worse than big brother,"more people are coming to the truthful conclusion that globalism is a failure and nationalism where a countrys people and interests are valued above that of noncitizens is the way forward a problem is that the globalismnationalism framework is exactly the type of dialectic elites can use to usher in a global war or crackdown to further increase their power
imagine there is a wife who is tired of her husband going out every night with his friends to drink instead of nagging at him every evening which would have the effect of motivating him to leave the house even sooner she will wait until he gets into a drunk driving accident or serious bar fight so she could draw the line and make the reasonable ultimatum for him to never drink again the husband is more likely to listen to her after something wrong takes place than after he had a safe night out
right now the nationalist movement is being allowed to gain strength so that a future event can act as a trigger for globalists to draw the line on the movement by imprisoning or killing its strongest members in other words globalists plan to use nationalism as a trap a device they transform into to their advantage as of right now the budding nationalist movement is extremely useful in allowing them to identify all resisters before easily crushing them when the time is right
elites cannot advance their plans without a dialectic 
the way the elites move an agenda forward is through a dialectic  meaning that two opposing ideologies rub against each other create friction and from that comes a desired result ie order from chaos those in power either control or monitor the existence of both sides to guide and bend the dialectic to serve their ends
the recent rise in nationalism i speculate has been allowed because previous dialectics such as capitalism vs communism and democracy vs terrorism are no longer useful in advancing the desired agenda soviet communism is dead and increased terrorism did not allow planned wars in syria and iran to proceed like  did with iraq and afghanistan in addition the white vs black race war is years late stubbornly resistant to the gasoline that obama pours onto the fire a new dialectic must be nurtured and so nationalism may just do the trick hillarys recent alt right speech officially debuted american nationalism as the new enemy
while your conclusion that nationalism is logical and beneficial to a nation is true and im sure to agree with it you were guided onto those beliefs how did you arrive at nationalist thought through decades of free trade feminism and opendoor immigration that have worn you and your country down your arrival at nationalist conclusions is the direct result of globalism which means that nationalist thoughts exist in your mind only because of the likes of george soros who pulled out a million muslims from his hat and placed them in europe while sponsoring a multitude of social justice organizations in the united states his actions and behavior along with other powerful globalists like him have essentially created your very ideology because you are entrenched in a dialectic where opposing forces must exist and be in combat with each other
the growth of nationalism is useful nationalism must continue to grow in power right before the moment it can threaten globalist banking and geopolitical interests and when it does the globalists will clamp down severely on it as if replaying world war  they will identify a nationalist country as the big bad bully and then use that country as an excuse to start a war that will simultaneously weed out nationalists throughout the world by sending them to die or having them arrested at home for subversion or treason russia is the evil nationalist country that neocons and others have been poking and even poland is being puffed up into an undemocratic country in order to hedge their bets

a hint that this may already be taking place is that france recently called upon patriots to serve in their national guard to protect citizens since when does france care about patriots they have committed no consistent actions in the past decade that suggest they do care so we must reasonably conclude that this new army is a trap to attract nationalists into a game where the end result is their death i wouldnt be surprised if frances beefedup army is used to start a war in a place like poland which will be painted as an aggressor that caused economic attacks upon the saintly western europeans
as long as youre in the dialectic which i see as a sort of twilight zone creation of the mega rich youre fighting on their terms they need the nationalist grassroots uprising to create violent events that allow them to reassert control and power even though nationalism may be the most sane movement of the day it still plays into their hands as long as we insist on having only two sides of the debate good and evil as if we were living in a hollywoodstyle storyline instead of this twodimensional arrangement the solution may be to go d where you can move front and back and around in a spectrum of ideas instead of just left and right where youre a pawn of the game no matter what side you pick
just because a nationalist resistance is growing doesnt mean that that the globalists in power are being hurt without being able to effectively control the western population through the cold war terrorism racial divideandconquer or modern russian aggression they are hoping that the nationalist movement grows enough to create the conflict that moves their chess pieces forward while im not urging you to throw away your nationalist beliefs as i surely wont throw away mine it is clear to me that a trap is waiting to be sprung and we will all suffer when its finally launched

K,re why donald trump must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money,"republican presidential nominee donald trump on wednesday celebrated the reuse of a landmark that was heading toward being just another old building before he made it a luxury hotel and turned it into a symbol of what he wants to achieve as president
coming off of campaign events in florida tuesday and before he jetted off to north carolina to resume his quest for the white house trump was joined by his wife and children at the formal grand opening of the trump international hotel washington dc built in the citys historic old post office building
under budget and ahead of schedule so important we dont hear those words so often but you will said trump  linking the hotel redevelopment to his promised performance as president today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country

my job is to look at undeveloped spaces and imagine what they could be he said these are spaces that have no hope no future but you need imagination and you need the ability to get them done and to unlock their potential and to unlock the potential of the people working on those spaces and on those projects and we have so many things we can do for our country
the united states is great he said its great its people are great there is no task or project too great there is no dream outside of our reach dont ever let anyone tell you it cant be done the future lies with the dreamers not the cynics and the critics
 
the fact that trump took a few hours for something other than the campaign grated on some who felt the event was an improper distraction

republican strategist steve schmidt  who helped sen john mccain rariz in his  white house race was among those who said trumps priorities were skewed
the walls are collapsing schmidt said referring to polls showing trump behind trump has discounted those polls as inaccurate and pointed to others that show him leading

Jason Easley,the real reason why the clinton email scandal is back has nothing to do with helping trump,"by sarah jones on tue nov st  at  am a veteran spy is alleging that russia is cultivating supporting and assisting donald trump and has been for at least five years the spy said the response from the fbi was shock and horror share on twitter print this post 
a veteran spy is alleging that russia is cultivating supporting and assisting donald trump and has been for at least five years the spy said the response from the fbi was shock and horror 
the report alleges that trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin and that russian intelligence claims to have compromised trump on his visits and could blackmail him 
david corn at mother jones reported 
mother jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote the first memo based on the former intelligence officers conversations with russian sources noted russian regime has been cultivating supporting and assisting trump for at least  years aim endorsed by putin has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance it maintained that trump and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the kremlin including on his democratic and other political rivals it claimed that russian intelligence had compromised trump during his visits to moscow and could blackmail him it also reported that russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on hillary clinton based on bugged conversations she had on various visits to russia and intercepted phone calls 
the former intelligence officer says the response from the fbi was shock and horror the fbi after receiving the first memo did not immediately request additional material according to the former intelligence officer and his american associates yet in august they say the fbi asked him for all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources the former spy forwarded to the bureau several memossome of which referred to members of trumps inner circle after that point he continued to share information with the fbi its quite clear there was or is a pretty substantial inquiry going on he says 
in august corn reports the fbi asked the spy for all information related to his findings and he continued to share information with the fbi which he says made it clear there was a pretty substantial inquiry going on 
if this report is accurate the spys information confirms what senator harry reid says intelligence experts and fbi director james comey already shared with him regarding explosive information regarding ties and coordination between donald trump and russia 
this report also rings true given report about the trump server repeatedly being connected to russia including trumps server possibly communicating with a russian bank 
it also makes sense given the many ties to russia within trumps own campaign and indeed trumps own rhetoric regarding nato and russia trump changed the republican party platforms proukraine proposals and talked about weakening nato both of which mirrored putins wish list nbc reported monday evening that the fbi is in the preliminary stages of investigating trumps excampaign managers connection to russia 
donald trump has already been busted for reading russian propaganda at his rallies as newsweeks kurt eichenwald uncovered an instance of trump reading propaganda directly from putin at a rally in pennsylvania 
eichenwald pointed out something vital and that is that the russians have been hacking into american emails and then falsifying them in hopes of impacting the presidential election the russians have been obtaining american emails and now are presenting complete misrepresentations of themfalsifying themin hopes of setting off a cascade of events that might change the outcome of the presidential election the big question of course is why are the russians working so hard to damage clinton and in the process aid donald trump 
the answer to why putin is trying so hard to defeat clinton might be in multiple reports that he fears her unlike donald trump hillary clinton is no pushover according to former us officials putin sees clinton as a forceful proponent of regime change policies that the russian leader considers a grave threat to his own survival 
trump has been acting like someone already groomed by the kremlin hes been a willing puppet for their dangerous goal of destroying western democracy he is easily flattered and easily manipulated its also easy to see how they could have gotten something on him with which to blackmail him  see the billy bush bus tape of trump bragging about sexual assault trump is easy bait 
the fact that the fbi director felt compelled to announce something about hillarys emails that turned out to not be about her emails but about her aides emails and even then he wasnt sure what they said or even if they were duplicates but he chose to keep this explosive information about donald trumps ties to russia under wraps is very disturbing

secret peace negotiations between mozambiques opposition leader afonso dhlakama and eu mediators were annulled at the weekend after fighting erupted between the countrys army and former rebel fighters local media say 
the meeting aimed to contribute to talks that began in may to find a solution to the conflict between the government and dhlakamas rebel group turned political party renamo 
we had agreed with president filipe nyusi that two mediators would come  to meet me the independent weekly canal de mocambique quoted dhlakama as saying 
dhlakama said he had cancelled the meeting after the army increased its presence near the place of the meeting 
there was a violent shootout i even heard explosions from here said dhlakama who has been in hiding in the central gorongosa mountains since october  
so i called chief mediator mario raffaelli to tell him that armed forces had come to ambush me he added 
dhlakama quoted the mediator as saying that he was convinced that the ruling frelimo party wanted to capture me during the meeting 
it is obvious they have a plan to kill me he added 
raffaelli declined to comment on the matter but an eu diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that two mediators had gone to gorongosa for a meeting with the opposition leader 
the diplomat said dhlakama had told the mediators to turn back at the very last moment 
the political situation in mozambique has been tense for months with dhlakama refusing to recognize the results of the  elections where the frelimo party was declared the winner the party has been in power since the southern african countrys independence from portugal in  dhlakama also threatened to seize power by force in the northern half of the country 
renamo and the frelimoled government had been engaged in a civil war for  years that was brought to an end in  
renamos armed wing has conducted a string of fatal assaults in central mozambique in recent years as it seeks to increase its share of power 
on october  the warring sides resumed a new round of peace talks despite the killing of an opposition negotiator on october

iranian parliament speaker ali larijani says the european union can play a significant role in the settlement of the syrian crisis and the campaign against terrorism 
larijani made the remarks in a meeting with visiting finnish president sauli niinistö in tehran on wednesday 
he said that iran supports political solutions to crises in the middle east including the conflict in syria while some extraregional players as well as regional sponsors of terrorist groups sabotaged diplomatic solutions through adopting wrong approaches 
the top iranian parliamentarian also warned against the spillover of terrorism to other regions across the world 
unfortunately military intervention by outsiders in regional issues and adopting a military approach and double standards on terrorism have led to a rise in the number of terrorist groups and contributed to their activities larijani said 
he also blamed the extremist and deviated ideology of wahhabism for the spread of terrorism in the region stressing that neither sunnis nor shias support terrorist or extremist acts 
elsewhere in his remarks larijani welcomed the expansion of ties between tehran and helsinki 
the finnish official for his part called for the further promotion of ties between his country and iran 
he also expressed regret about terrorist attacks in afghanistan iraq and syria and the lack of a political will to end the conflicts 
terrorists pose threat to their own countries

the senior iranian official also raised the alarm over the issue of state terrorism pursued by the zionists 
earlier in the day finlands president also met and held talks with iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif on the developments in the middle east and the promotion of bilateral ties in different sectors including economic and banking cooperation

Isaac Davis,this is the man militarized police at standing rock are working for,"if you signed up for obamacare youve been screwed 
if you didnt sign up and opted to pay the penalties  youve been screwed 
if you didnt sign up didnt pay penalties and stuck with your original insurance company youve been screwed 
if you didnt sign up didnt pay penalties and paid cash for medical care youve been screwed 
every person in america has been affected regardless of what you did or did not do 
thats because the affordable care act irrevocably ruined our access to medical care at an affordable price in this country in the mere span of  years the prices have skyrocketed and many families have to pay more in monthly premiums than they pay on their mortgages meanwhile medical costs have been driven up to astronomical prices making it nearly impossible to pay outofpocket for care 
and these premiums they are for the crappiest coverage you can imagine some families pay  a month for  coverage after they pay the  deductible thats nearly  per year before obamacare pays for a penny of their costs 
and nownow that insurance companies have gone belly up when they were forced to become a part of the exchange medical costs are skyrocketing doctors wont see patients who arent covered employers stopped offering insurance as a benefit and people lost their jobs due to obamacare costs 
the whole thing is failing even president obama has admitted it  and now we have proof that it was planned that way 
but that isnt the worst of it the worst of it is that this program was designed to fail and steer us into single payer healthcare where a government entity can decide what procedures will or will not be covered theyll decide who is deserving of cancer treatment and who is not theyll mandate things like flu shots and childhood vaccines 
one of the recent wikileaks shows that hillary clinton knew this and was complicit

which begins the unraveling of the affordable care act 
a democrat supporting republican legislation to destroy obamacare on purpose how many millions have they raked in on this deal and bilked the american people for in obamacare penalties because they cant afford the affordable health care and the american people will look at this like a victory when it does unravel even though it has been the plan all along 
hillary clinton that savior of woman and children knew that this would fail  she is supporting the legislation to destroy it leaving everyone in america at the mercy of the horrible replacement that she will dream up to redistribute wealth and deal the death blow to the alreadystruggling middle class

cnn commentator angela rye on wednesday blamed the failure of republicans to repeal and replace obamacare for the newly announced doubledigit premium increases in the presidents signature health care law 
its not just hillary clinton that needs to tackle this but also congress rye said on cnns new day the reason we are in the position that we are in right now frankly alisyn is because republicans fell short of their promise to repeal which is what they said they wanted to do and replace 
host alisyn camerota stopped rye before she got any further and reminded her that president obama had promised premiums would go down 
most states will see health care premiums under the affordable care act increase by an average of  percent according to data released this week by the obama administration indiana will see its rates slightly go down but other states like arizona will see costs skyrocket by  percent members of the administration have been quick to soften the blow of the increase by reminding people that a majority of those on the obamacare exchanges would be receiving tax credits to help pay for the now more expensive health insurance plans   ",prisonplanet.com,Fake,english,20.8,47.88118811881188,36,5,1193,200,4.915,200.0,-0.7937039820034537,-0.9536307555522068,-0.4724714373725592,-0.4644186934141827,-0.1718414264794564,-0.4636792011636438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9815,0.154,0.036,0.81,Positive,Very Strong

its easy to glance at tuesdays popular vote  which with  percent of all precincts reporting shows hillary clinton with six million fewer votes than barack obama won in   and reach the conclusion that clinton lost the white house because she failed to turn out the democratic base but the truth is much more complicated while she underperformed relative to obamas  totals in several midwestern states  ohio michigan iowa and wisconsin  clinton ran virtually even with obama in the battlegrounds of pennsylvania north carolina virginia nevada and new hampshire whats more she far surpassed obamas  vote total in florida the countrys biggest swing state yet somehow while obama carried florida clinton lost it which brings us to an important question was donald trump just good enough to beat a bad democratic opponent on tuesday or does he deserve far more credit could he for instance have competed with the vaunted obama machine the answer somewhat shockingly is yes 
a review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that trump  would have defeated obama  in the electoral college disclaimer this obviously is an applestooranges exercise because no two elections are the same nor are any two electorates still unlike debating whether the  cubs would defeat the  yankees this is not an entirely abstract argument a comparison of their respective performances in the countrys most competitive states shows trump edging obama in a hypothetical headtohead matchup the math might seem impossible after all obama won nearly  million votes in  trump is currently at  million and should finish around  million which will actually be one million fewer votes than mitt romney won how then could trump have topped obama in the electoral college the answer republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nations most critical battleground states lets look at them individually in descending order by population and do the electoralvote math the  totals arent yet final because not all precincts have reported

jeery park,what happens to our lungs brain  mood when we use a himalayan salt lamps,"keywords cranberries  cranberry  cranberry juice  kidney disease  urinary tract infections  uti  utis 
cranberry juice and tablets have been recommended as a way to either prevent recurring urinary tract infection uti or treat the symptoms but a new study finds theres no difference between people treated with cranberries or placebos 
a lack of evidence for cranberry juice or capsules as being an effective preventative measure or treatment has been a recurring argument in the scientific literature for years now cranberry juice  an unrealistic recommendation for utis 
a urinary tract infection occurs when bacteria gets into your urine and travels up to your bladder according to the urinary care foundation  utis cause more than  million visits to health care providers each year about  in  women and  in  men will have symptoms of at least one uti during their lifetime 
for years now cranberry juice has been recommended to aid in preventing or treating utis however theres no solid evidence that any amount is having a positive effect 
additionally based on the results of a recent study led by infectious disease specialist manisha juthanimehta from the yale school of medicine even if you switch to highly concentrated capsules you still dont see a noticeable positive effect 
in response to this recent study lindsay e nicolle an expert on utis from the university of manitoba advises the following 
the continuing promotion of cranberry use to prevent recurrent uti in the popular press or online advice seems inconsistent with the reality of repeated negative studies or positive studies compromised by methodological shortcomings 
nicolle adds clinicians should not be promoting cranberry use by suggesting that there is proven or even possible benefit any continued promotion of the use of cranberry products seems to go beyond available scientific evidence and rational reasoning it is time to move on from cranberries myth versus facts 
theres a couple of reasons why the myth that cranberry juice is beneficial in preventing and treating utis has persisted for so long 
first the active ingredient in cranberries  atype proanthocyanidins pacs  has been shown to block the adhesion of bacteria to the wall of the bladder so a vast majority of people have reasoned that if bacteria are causing utis something that blocks bacteria from accumulating in the bladder could be a potential preventive or treatment measure 
but according to timothy boone md phd vice dean of the texas am health science center college of medicine houston campus and chairperson of the department of urology for houston methodist hospital theres one problem  
cranberry juice especially the juice concentrates you find at the grocery store will not treat a uti or bladder infection it can offer more hydration and possibly wash bacteria from your body more effectively but the active ingredient in cranberry is longgone by the time it reaches your bladder 
dr boone adds it takes an extremely large concentration of cranberry to prevent bacterial adhesion this amount of concentration is not found in the juices we drink theres a possibility it was stronger back in our grandparents day but definitely not in modern times 
for example ocean sprays cranberry juice cocktail is only  percent juice something so watered down could not be so ineffective 
the second reason the myth continues is that its a tempting myth to believe if you experience recurring utis and want to prevent them  or you want to feel empowered while youre waiting for the antibiotics to take effect  drinking cranberry juice or taking capsules is a fairly easy and simple way to feel like youre helping resolve your problem 
unfortunately though youre paying a lot of money for something thats only really doing the same job as a glass of water and cranberry juice is full of sugar anyway golden rules for kidney health 
you can do a number of things to help keep your kidneys functioning properly at every stage of life 
heres a list of ways to reduce the risk of kidney disease  including urinary tract infections drink plenty of liquids especially water  drinking water helps dilute your urine and ensures that youll urinate more frequently  allowing bacteria to be flushed from your urinary tract before an infection can begin stay active and keep fit  keeping fit helps to reduce your blood pressure staying active and keeping fit also reduces the risk of chronic kidney disease eat healthy and keep your weight in check  this can help prevent diabetes heart disease and other debilitating conditions associated with chronic kidney disease reduce your salt intake  the recommended sodium intake is  grams of salt per day  around a teaspoon try limiting the amount of processed and restaurant food and dont add salt to food its easier to control your salt intake if you prepare the food yourself with fresh ingredients dont take overthecounter pills on a regular basis  common nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs  like ibuprofen  are known to cause kidney damage and disease if taken regularly this type of medication probably doesnt pose considerable danger if your kidneys are reasonably healthy and you use them for emergencies only however if you are dealing with chronic pain  like back pain or arthritis  work with your doctor to find natural ways to control your pain without putting your kidneys at risk wipe from front to back  doing so after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra change your birth control method  diaphragms or unlubricated or spermicidetreated condoms can all contribute to bacterial growth avoid potentially irritating feminine products  using deodorant sprays or other feminine products such as douches and powders in the genital area can irritate the urethra empty your bladder soon after intercourse  also drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria regularly control of your blood sugar level  about half of people who have diabetes develop kidney damage so it is important for people with diabetes to have regular tests to check their kidney functions

lets get this straight calling hillary clinton a bigot has reporters asking every republican in sight if donald trump has gone too far but the clinton campaign releases a video saying mr trump is the candidate of the ku klux klan and its all okeydokey 
then again mr trump has already been likened to hitler mussolini and stalin small wonder theres a collective hohum when democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine says mr trump is peddling kkk values 
this is what democrats do it didnt start with mr trump either for years democrats have portrayed the gop as one giant hate group 
each presidential election the drill goes like this 
after republicans nominate someone he immediately finds himself having to prove hes not a hater  of africanamericans of women of gays etc 
this year democrats added a twist mr trump they claim represents a break with all those decent and lovable republicans such as mitt romney  john mccain and george w bush  of course this isnt what they were saying back when these men were running for president 
 in  for example an naacp ad recreated the gruesome murder of james byrd to imply that thengov bush was sympathetic to lynching black men over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck mr byrds daughter says so when gov george w bush refused to support hatecrimes legislation it was like my father was killed all over again 
 when john mccain ran in  barack obama warned that republicans would scare people by saying you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills the mccain campaign fired back accusing mr obama of playing the race card from the bottom of the deck funny thing all those reporters always hearing dog whistles from republicans somehow didnt hear this one 
 in  when mitt romney went to the naacp and told them facetoface about his opposition to obamacare the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote vice president joe biden put it more explicitly telling a largely africanamerican audience that if mr romney were to win hed put yall back in chains 
the only difference today is that republicans now have a nominee giving as good as he gets",21stcenturywire.com,Fake,english,13.949260103271609,23.401690216082972,115,17,2243,388,4.72680412371134,388.0,1.6217241261000772,1.3011778279668569,-0.1946711843783318,-0.1696947048821885,-0.3575722998840939,-0.1620646813919597,0.0025773195876288,0.0,0.0025773195876288,0,0,0.0,0.004563821062923,0.7278,0.112,0.096,0.792,Positive,Strong

the leader of iraqs semiautonomous kurdistan region has assured that kurdish peshmerga forces will not set foot in mosul during a joint operation with the army and allied fighters aimed at liberating the daeshheld northern city 
the peshmerga will not enter the city of mosul masoud barzani said in a news conference with chairman of the islamic supreme council of iraq isci ammar hakim in zartac mountain near the city of nineveh on thursday 
barzani further said the kurdish fighters are coordinating their role in the mosul liberation operation with the iraqi military adding that the collaboration will continue 
the kurdish leader further highlighted unity among different iraqi political parties adding that daesh was no more a threat as most areas are back in control of the iraqi forces 
last week the popular mobilization units a mainlyshia military group backing the iraqi army in the mosul offensive also said its forces would not march into mosul adding that iraqi army soldiers and security personnel would enter the embattled city 
barzani further referred to recent daesh terror activities in the kurdishcontrolled city of kirkuk saying the takfiri terror group is making desperate attempts to cover up its defeats in the mosul battle 
we were able to control the situation quickly and kill the terrorists the kurdish leader said 
terrorists launched several rounds of attacks in the city of kirkuk over the weekend as iraqi officials are focused on the mosul offensive 
on friday at least  daesh elements went on a rampage in kirkuk to divert an iraqi and kurdish military advance on mosul the incident left  civilians and members of the security forces dead as well as  militants according to iraqi security officials leader of iraqs semiautonomous kurdistan region masoud barzani nd l receives chairman of the islamic supreme council of iraq isci ammar hakim nd r in zartac mountain near the city of nineveh october   photo by reuters 
for his part hakim highlighted the need for avoiding rifts in iraq and staying focused on the fight against daesh 
he further stressed that a turkish base present in bashiqa near mosul was not welcome 
this turkish base and the forces that came to the base were present without coordination with the iraqi government they are armed forces and we strongly refuse the participation of any noniraqi fighter in this battle hakim said 
last december turkey deployed some  soldiers equipped with heavy weapons and backed by  to  tanks to the bashiqa camp 
ankara claimed the deployment was part of a mission to train and equip iraqi kurdish peshmerga forces in the fight against daesh but baghdad denounced the unauthorized move as a violation of iraqs sovereignty 
recently ankara claimed that his country is involved in the mosul operation but baghdad denied such a role 
last week the iraqi army volunteer shia and sunni fighters as well as kurdish peshmerga forces launched a longawaited operation to wrest control of mosul the last stronghold of daesh in the arab country 
many believe that the recapture of mosul which fell to daesh in  would signal the terror outfits total defeat in iraq 
iraqi special forces commanders said thursday that the mosul operation was proceeding as planned and they were now waiting for further gains in the south before resuming their push toward the city 
the operation has not been stopped and is proceeding as planned special forces brigadier general haider fadhil said 
in another development on thursday the us estimated that up to  daesh terrorists have been killed in the mosul liberation operation so far 
general joseph votel the head the us militarys central command said the operation was taking a heavy toll on the takfiris 
there are between  and  daesh elements in mosul and up to another  in the broader area according to us figures 
more daesh tunnels uncovered 
also on thursday iraqi troops discovered several tunnels used by daesh terrorists in recently recaptured villages of bartella and bazwaia located between  and  kilometers east of mosul 
when we entered the khazna taba neighborhood in bartella and after we liberated it we found several tunnels said razed qusai alkinani a member of iraqi counterterrorism forces 
one of the tunnels which is  meters long and  meters deep was used by daesh for meetings and allowed the terror outfits ringleaders to move around during the battle he added 
elsewhere in the village of tob zawa the iraqi troops found a tire shop that had been converted into a factory for making roadside bombs and attaching armor to vehicles 
they also discovered another tunnel in the village equipped with fans and lights that ran from beneath a mosque out to a road loading",presstv.ir,Real,english,99.2,47.88118811881188,47,7,4912,808,5.022277227722772,808.0,-0.4573785492295443,-0.5778293249656962,0.5114706015660425,0.4887312269446071,-0.0659693234647356,0.5117549904383986,0.0012376237623762,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0030655527373751,-0.9931,0.054,0.104,0.842,Negative,Very Strong
No Author,wikileaks hillary clinton knew saudi qatar were funding isis  but still took their money for foundation,"st century wire says 
yesterday wikileaks editor and founder julian assange confirmed what wire already knew  that hillary clinton and the obama white houses claim of the us election process being hacked by the russian government was a desperate work of fiction not content with that fish tale hillary clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low if that was even possible with another wilder madeup conspiracy story about the russians 
the following statement made by hillary clinton yesterday epitomizes the term  jumping the shark  its time for trump to answer serious questions about his ties to russia httpstcodosmyvar pictwittercomdryempjx 
 hillary clinton hillaryclinton october   
apparently hillary clintons campaign staff fed her a planted online news story by the clinton campaign which ran on a questionable prodemocratic party online news outlet on monday the slate ran the story by one of its alleged journalists named franklin foer  complete with a clickbait bloglike headline was a trump server communicating with russia 
whatever legitimacy the slate had before last night just evaporated 
john roberts from forbes explains the bottom line is that slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season as for foer he says on twitter a follow up piece is in the works 
roberts rightly points out that the only followup story for this lemon should start with the word retraction 
cyber feud assange believes clinton has gone beyond the pale with her russian conspiracy obsession 
during his exclusive interview with awardwinning filmmaker john pilger when asked what he thought of hillary clintons shrill antics julian assange said  i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions tormented literally to the point where they become sick 
the saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the clinton campaign and the democratic party  is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty like hillary clinton in her sociopathic path to power the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess 
still clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower  with a decadeold misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of donald trump in a tmzstyle tabloid sting that pretty much sums up democratic party strategy for this election season 
assange was right clinton the democratic party and their surrogate are eating themselves such are the spoils of power in washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it

obamas abstention from a un vote against the us is a new low for the most antiamerican administration in american history under obama our foreign policy has been reoriented toward damaging our own interests as much as possible but actively opposing us policy at the un is a new low 
the resolution ares is on the necessity of ending the economic commercial and financial embargo imposed by the united states of america against cuba 
it was introduced at the request of cuba back in  with a memorandum that accused america of pursuing an aggressive policy against cuba with the declared aim of imposing on it the political social and economic order which the united states authorities consider most fitting this policy has included direct military intervention the threat of nuclear annihilation the instigation and carrying out of countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders 
as obamas creepy toady ben rhodes tweeted no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose 
except the failed policy is that of the united states by we rhodes means that obama and the left arent going to defend the united states in international forums when they disagree with the us 
all this is yet another reminder that the people running the country are not of the country theyre a hostile foreign ideology that sees itself as separate from the united states and does not believe it has any responsibilities toward the united states 
at the un samantha power took the antiamerican positions to applause from a un united with obama against america 
for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you

former defense minister of canada paul hellyer has filed a lawsuit along with several others at the state canada on the ceta treaty ceta stands for comprehensive economic and trade agreement a trade which are entered according to prosecutors constitutional and international rights of people with feet paul hellyer called the treaty therefore comprehensive trade and takeover agreement with this convention which comes out of the hat of the international bankers  families will obtain control over almost the entire world constitutions of member countries will no longer apply only the will of the  families the elite will apply 
the lawsuit was officially filed on october  of this year and actually consists of four 
namely separate indictments the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to sign execute and implement treaties without the express prior authority of parliament through an act of parliament 
the federal government has no constitutional right to sign ceta and  or perform without having this treaty first by the parliament through official channels  the solid majority of the ceta articles and their impact encroach on exclusive provincial spheres or forumprotected by the division of powers under the constitution act  
most of the ceta provisions and their impact undermine exclusive legal rights protected by the canadian constitutional law  the ceta gouge and extinguishes the constitutionally protected judiciary in canada by creating foreign tribunals to determining property and legal issues in canada without any judicial oversight or jurisdiction of the canadian courts over the disputes and 
ceta removes the constitutional legal system by setting foreign tribunals have to judge between property and other legal issues without overlooked may be the canadian legal system and various articles of the ceta violate constitutional enshrined rights in the charter of rights and freedoms  and overrides charter guarantees that ground canadas ability to mount public programs on health education social services and public utilitiesincluding the elimination of subsidies monopolies and state enterprises for public welfare in short the treaty places the rights of private foreign investors about those of the canadian constitution and canadian citizens 
various provisions of ceta violated constitutional builtrights enshrined in the document charter of rights and freedoms and transcend guaranteed rights that canada has the opportunity to develop public programs in the fields of health education social services and public funds including the termination of subsidies  monopolies and state enterprises for the public interest in short the treaty puts the interests of private foreign companies over those of the canadian constitution and its inhabitants 
but this is not all paul hellyer which is so you can immediately see and hear his call to canadians and the rest of the world his mind has put on the roll of the largest crime syndicate has ever known the world the international bankers international intertwined the main industries in which the owners of the revenues come from only  families 
paul hellyer remembers the canada which was separate from the bankers yet not so long ago until  the canadian government expressed its money itself there was no such thing as inflation poverty and debt canada was one of the largest financiers behind the allies that europe was liberated from the germans at that time life was good cheap and everyone had enough money to do the things they wanted to do from one day to the issued money creation in  the central banks and money was no longer free within a few years canada had a huge debt that is recovered just as us on the civilian population through numerous taxes paul hellyer has evidence that this happened in unconstitutional manner and wants to decide turn back to canada to give it right back himself pressing her money to spend this affects every canadian citizen a large sum of money to free education health housing etc can be paid without causing debts paul hellyer does the same as foundation for our money aims but in a turbo version he lets no grass grow does not perform educational skits for the people who maintain this crime for years paul hellyer goes straight for the scapegoat 
now the video of paul hellyer where he explains personally exactly what is going on and how they want to approach this 
dear readers this could be the big break this information should be shared very broadly as to all countries under the thumb are the bankers the same applies we can deliver all of this unfair system where our benefit only a handful of people the power over the creation of money is a sovereign matter since no one has more to do with it we want a better and fairer world then this is the opportunity that everyone has been waiting for 
privatized money is the reason for all wars privatized money is the cause of poverty oppression exploitation neglect of our elderly and less fortunate privatized money is the root of all evil on this beautiful planet now is the chance to get out from under the yoke to stand up for the future of ourselves and our children now is the chance to rid the world of those people who make a huge mess for over  years with one goal to keep the creation of money in their hands and with it the power over almost anything this planet has to offer

No Author,trump warns of world war iii if clinton is elected,"email 
donald trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the november election will be rigged against him 
of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day trump tweeted monday morning why do republican leaders deny what is going on so naive 
its a charge that even other republicans have been quick to refute critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the us democratic process 
states backed by tens of thousands of gop and dem volunteers ensure integrity of electoral process sen jeff flake of arizona who is often sharply critical of trump tweeted sunday elections are not rigged 
jon husted the secretary of state of ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state also said monday that he could assure trump the election would not be rigged 
trumps most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls before now trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early august 
and im telling you november  wed better be careful because that election is going to be rigged the new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity in august and i hope the republicans are watching closely or its going to be taken away from us 
multiple republicans told business insider at the time that trumps assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous as trump would be the first us presidential candidate in modern times possibly ever to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election 
allen raymond a former gop operative who was involved in the  new hampshire senate election phonejamming scandal called trumps continued insistence that the election would be rigged detrimental to the republic 
the idea that its rigged i dont know what hes talking about he said in august i know someone that rigged elections i mean you know the fact of the matter is hillary clinton doesnt need to rig this election trumps going to win alabama and thats it she doesnt have to do anything its painful to watch 
raymond wrote how to rig an election confessions of a republican operative as a tellall about the attempt to rig the  new hampshire senate election between thengov jeanne shaheen a democrat and republican us rep john e sununu raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the new hampshire democrats office in manchester  a task his phone bank was hired to carry out sununu went on to win the election by roughly  votes shaheen defeated sununu in a rematch in  
the operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvementhe said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that  not what trumps talking about 
the manhattan billionaire told the washington post in august that a lack of voteridentification laws would let people just keep voting and voting and voting and suggested fraud occurred in  against republican nominee mitt romney because there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the republican 
i dont even know what hes talking about raymond said but this idea that its  or  and the party bosses are going to roll into pittsburgh and philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines  thats nonsense an election rigging these days means something totally different than what hes talking about now its stupid stuff like what i did in new hampshire 
he said the lack of voterid laws trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus 
these voterid laws whats the intention of that the clear intention is disenfranchisement he said echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voterid laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots you know theres a reason we dont have a poll tax anymore because its unconstitutional 
people dont vote  times he continued there might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times but hes talking about an institutional effort its a total myth 
he said trumps statements were an attempt to basically sideline hillary clintons first four years in office 
the idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the democratic national committee had its emails hacked and leaked though both trump and sen bernie sanders of vermont clintons main opponent in the democratic primary had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season the emails showed that the organization which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary favored clinton 
trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was rigged against sanders in his earlyaugust interview with hannity in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail he used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,50,10,4834,824,4.828883495145631,824.0,-0.3656534312002963,-0.0141271790859303,0.4908340113436141,0.5138141195856278,-0.2568299712689491,0.5374243112700312,0.0036407766990291,0.0,0.0012135922330097,0,1,0.0,0.006987628197581,-0.9946,0.054,0.114,0.831,Negative,Very Strong

Sarah Jones,donald trump calls a black supporter a paid thug and kicks him out of his rally,"by hrafnkell haraldsson    am the kkk newspaper features the front page full page story make america great again with a big featured center photo of donald trump   
rachel maddow traces the history of the postcivil war enforcement acts signed by president ulysses s grant including the ku klux klan act  or the enforcement act of   stat  which still makes it illegal to conspire to intimidate voters 
to show that the klan act is not vestigial but very much relevant in this election maddow points to the citation of this law by the democrat party in a whole raft of lawsuits in nevada arizona pennsylvania and ohio alleging voter intimidation 
maddow points out that though voter intimidation is illegal anyway the significance of the klan act is that it prohibits conspiracy to prevent by force intimidation or threat any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for president or vice president or as a member of congress of the united states 
as an example of the role the kkk plays in trumps campaign maddow produced the kkks newspaper of today which bills itself as the political voice of white christian america which you might note is identical with fox news demographic this paper she says has been turning up on front lawns in the great state of georgia 
watch courtesy of msnbc discussion begins at  mark 
tonight we just got a hold of this disgusting development this is the newspaper of the ku klux klan today its the crusader the political voice of white christian america the premier voice of white resistance theyve got  you see the white power symbol there in the upper righthand corner theyve got a whole media operation going on apparently watch white pride tv listen to kkk radio  hours a day this newsletter is about  pages long features articles on the threat of nonwhite immigration a very subtle feature on black people committing terrible crimes against white people theres an article by the founder of the america first party which is all about the terrorist jews he brags in his byline that hes the man who david duke credits for awakening him to the threat of jewish supremacism its exactly what you would think from the ku klux klan newspaper if you knew there was a ku klux klan newspaper these days but the front page full page story is make america great again with a big featured center photo of donald trump its one of several articles in the paper about trump including this inset article about how trumps candidacy is moving the dialogue forward  those are a couple of the many many robocalls that were made during the republican primary campaign on behalf of donald trumps candidacy calls made by a white nationalist group that calls itself the american national super pac the trump campaign doesnt appear to have anything to do with these calls they reportedly returned a donation from the white nationalist guy who you hear on the call when it was first reported that he was making these calls and that he was a trump donor it was further embarrassing to the trump campaign when this guy this farmer and white nationalist who does these robocalls he was initially picked to be a trump delegate to the republican convention this year before his delegate status once got yanked once it was widely reported 
donald trumps white supremacist followers have made no secret of the fact that they want a white homeland and that of necessity the united states must be this white homeland as maddow has pointed out in the past and by their own admission their eugenics insanity is now out in the open because of donald trump 
dont believe maddow demographics pro looked at  donald trump twitter supporters and found that more than one third follow white nationalist twitter accounts 
the fact is trump has mainstreamed white supremacy and by not strongly denouncing it brought it into his own movement which seems to be a meeting place for much more than disaffected white workingclass americans whatever the mainstream media tells you

Larsen Halleck,dont believe the myth that weightlifting will slow you down,"home this month popular the path men took to trump the path men took to trump 
daryush roosh valizadeh created rok in october  you can visit his blog at rooshvcom or follow him on twitter and facebook rss november   politics 
every man who supports donald trump came to it from a different path some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants  or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect for me and many other men we came to support trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women  the fight began in  with the southern poverty law center 
in march  after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites  i was put on a list by the jewishoperated southern poverty law center for being a misogynist  i was shaken up by this because i knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths ive learned from it put me on a path of no return either i close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door 
i decided to keep going i responded to the splc designation with an article titled my existence is becoming illegal  where i described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it 
it is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street men can hate women but not the other way around men can rape women cant men can be abusive both physically and emotionally but women cant men can be misogynist but women cant be misandrist a word that is unknown to most of the american population men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist if youre a man youre likely a perpetrator of hate violence and abuse to innocent american women even if you dont yet realize your thought crime but never the other way around 
fast forward two years to october  witch hunts by leftists were in force rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists homophobes and sexists with the aim of getting them fired i studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles ive ever published what is a social justice warrior sjw  
the article was widely shared influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia the corporate news media hollywood fortune  companies silicon valley and the billionaire owners of our politicians scratch a feminist sjw and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes 
i was pessimistic when i wrote the sjw article thinking wed need a full generation  years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiamerican entity  i focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them little did i know that i was defining them at their absolute peak and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency the social justice warriors havent gone away and they are rushing to fulfill the will of george soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced along with the power of the institutions that support them 
though sjwism peaked in  i had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of  during the canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in february  during the international meetups  i survived those attacks and the fact that im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us they bruised me during the meetup outrage but i healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs donald trump donald trump ground zero 
im a pessimist by nature so i didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow trump to win in the primaries even though i was confident his ideas resonated with most americans but then i noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out no matter what his enemies did i saw him humiliate jeb bush  outcompete a resurgent ted cruz and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness by the time i attended the republican national convention in cleveland  i started to believe 
the ground zero for donald trump within the manosphere was the donald trump thread on the forum created in june  by veteran member and rok contributor samseau  this is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men over  pages long the thread has been viewed nearly  million times ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse as described here  to men with bullhorns larger than i have 
after significant battles in a real war medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier they all worked as a team to ensure victory from the general donald trump the colonels his advisers the captains major media influencers like alex jones matt drudge paul joseph watson and mike cernovich the sergeants men like myself the specialists men like samseau and on down to the private a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time 
the ego cares about how impactful one is how influential its ideas are but the team player only cares about victory for the whole whether i am a private or a sergeant i fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election but on the lives of so many men who participated in it approaching the date of the election 
two months before the election i did a youtube video urging men to vote for trump  and it resulted in nearly  unsubscribes within a day surprising even me since i thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a trump presidency the video echoed a lot of sentiments i shared in the article if donald trump doesnt win were screwed  where i tried to convey the danger of a hillary presidency 
obama was the race president and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years hillary will be the gender president the future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat trump 
not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again this isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like twitter or youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment 
for the next month i stared at the calendar waiting for the election to happen doing what i could to push back against the narrative on twitter  then in early october an old tape was released of trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him my sister called me confused and asked if he really was a bad man i told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate  i told her not to believe the media and to judge trump by his actions and his policies not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help hillarys failing campaign 
i spoke to her with confidence but inside i was concerned in a politically correct world would this be the blow to sink trumps candidacy is the majority of americans actually ready to defeat political correctness thankfully trump responded strongly ignoring calls by the traitors in the republican party to step down 
the first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that trumps support didnt decline the fake controversy didnt work i held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out maybe of him saying the nword but none did and i knew the establishment had no more bullets this was the moment where i finally believed i felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that trump was going to win i did a periscope that night as if i was amped up on methamphetamine but i took no drug 
from that point on it was just a matter of hanging on until finally on november  when he was elected president i was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when i was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against trump i didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom i consider on the same team as us if i made any miscalculation it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces i underestimated our own power and those of our allies in the alternative internet space human control is a foolhardy endeavor 
the most important lesson i learned from trumps victory is how pointless it is to control human beings both their behaviors and their minds every single major institution in the united states represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence could not stop a populist candidate in spite of trying everything short of assassination 
george soros and his billions werent effective obama and his allies werent effective the mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective ceos of the biggest companies in the united states werent effective hollywood and its superstars werent effective academia and its thousands of professors werent effective social media and its censorship efforts werent effective the fbi allowing hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective even donald trumps own party wasnt effective in stopping him its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers what a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably 
think right now of how much effort the antitrump forces put into stopping him from winning think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome and now think how it was all for nothing  they accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the american public 
whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature god tao or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it imagine how impotent george soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing 
now they have to perfect their control methods even more open their pocket books further and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody that they are powerful that the world must be shaped into their image that they are gods among men but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled 
you can control human beings but only temporarily and only some of them at the end of the day humans want to do what they want to do and if you dont possess what they wish to buy they will go to someone who does no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control the more you control what does not want to be controlled the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling of which we are currently living through in previous eras that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets but in our modern era it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes 
if you want to be a true leader of society create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want can freely engage in commerce can create families can live in safety can search for the truth without interference and can work and play and live according to their nature put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down it may take a decade it may take  years but it will happen and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness conclusion 
we are tired of being controlled leave us alone we are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us of forcing us to believe in falsehoods of programming us to hate our country of pitting woman against man and black against white leave us alone let men be men and from that a new american renaissance will come forth men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives and if you prevent us from doing so we wont allow you to live yours we will humiliate your useful idiots we will destroy your institutions we will lash out with more than just memes

russian president vladimir putin has dismissed as hysteria claims by us officials that moscow is trying to influence the upcoming presidential election in america 
speaking to foreign policy experts during a valdai discussion club meeting in sochi southern russia on thursday putin said washington was using russia as a distraction to cover up the fact that this years white house contenders had nothing to offer on real issues 
hysteria has been whipped up in the united states about the influence of russia over the us presidential election putin said adding that so far no clear policies have been offered by the us political elite to tackle issues such as national debt and gun control 
american officials and intelligence agencies have openly accused the kremlin of sponsoring hacking attacks against the us 
this is while democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton and her campaign have gone even further claiming that russia was trying to rig the november election in favor of republican nominee donald trump us democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton l and republican nominee donald trump 
during the last presidential debate last week clinton accused trump of having secret ties with moscow saying that putin would love to see a puppet president in the white house 
its much simpler to distract people with socalled russian hackers spies and agents of influence does anyone really think that russia could influence the american peoples choice in any way is america a banana republic or what putin asked in his thursday speech 
baffled by the release of a series of hacked emails that have uncovered the inner mechanics of the democratic partys campaign for the election the white house has stepped up its antirussian rhetoric american officials have even threatened russia with countermeasures 
despite the general belief however trump has on many occasions called on russiaaccusers to either provide their evidence or stop making baseless assumptions about moscow

john key channels nz taxpayers money to clinton foundation 


this is information that every taxpayer or those that care should know about but our journalists are not doing their job  

what with warships in our harbour and troops in iraq this government of john key is in lockstep with the most corrupt and warmongering part of the us government 

no doubt key would approve of the clintons defrauding the people of haiti its his style 

the cannabis party is calling on john key to explain why he gave over  million of new zealand taxpayers money to the clinton foundation  

legalise cannibis party 

 october  

wikileaks raised serious ethical concerns about the clinton foundation when it published a hacked email send to clinton campaign chairman john podesta revealing blurred lines between the foundation and the personal financial interests of bill and hillary clinton 

cannabis party leader julian crawford said if john key was serious about hiv prevention one of the clinton foundations supposed goals he should legalise medical cannabis in new zealand 

hundreds of researchers have reported that thc was able to destroy the riv virus in monkeys that virus is nearly identical to the hiv virus found in humans he said 

john key has a lot of explaining to do if the wikileaks revelations about the clinton foundation are true 

former assistant director of the fbi thomas fuentes confirmed that the fbi has an intensive investigation ongoing into the clinton foundation 

new zealands national business review has reported that john key will continue giving millions of dollars of taxpayers money to the foundation in the future despite the criminal investigation of hillary clinton 

ive met her on lots of occasions had dinner with her at premier house a few times john key said 

as secretary of state she was great very engaged with new zealand broadcaster duncan garner yesterday raised serious concerns about the ongoing payments to the clinton foundation known as paytoplay 

we also give money to the clinton foundation yes we did gosh who didnt get a handout garner said 

weve been feeding all these guys at the trough for years 

paytoplay refers to operations where bill and hillary clinton rewarded big donors to their foundation with preferential access to the us government

No Author,only geniuses  schizophrenics can pass this  question quiz  david avocado wolfe  davidwolfecom,"posted on october   by michael depinto 
for anyone who has heard about but not yet had a chance to learn the details about the undercover operation produced by james okeefe s project veritas about the inner workings of the democrat party youre in luck i have written two different posts covering the subject from different angles and this will be the third covering hillarys response each post include at least some if not all of the undercover recordings released so far by james okeefe  
for over a year okeefe risked his life by going deep undercover into the democrat partys factory of corruption and just this week after everyone laughed at trump for calling the election rigged okeefe began releasing portions of the shocking video he took while undercover in the videos some of the highest ranking members of the dnc make some of the most jawdropping admissions of guilt youve ever heard in your lives not the least of which is we have a call with hillarys campaign every day to go over what areas need more focus 
in the first post i wrote titled george soros master blueprint to conquer the west gets caught on camera  i go into detail about how the money funding all the illegal operations caught on film comes from hillary clinton s largest donor none other than george soros  one very high ranking democratic operative explains what happens with the money once it comes in upon receipt 
the campaign hillary clinton campaign pays the dnc the dnc pays democracy partners democracy partners pays the foval group and the foval group goes and executes the sh on the ground 
wow then when questioned about the legality the response was 
it doesnt matter what the friggin legal and ethics people say we need to win this motherfker 
thats just the beginning the evidence gets infinitely worse then in the second post i wrote titled this video guarantees a trump win even with hillarys fraud machine  i present an honest look at both candidates and how they operate the post contains  of the released undercover footage so far so you learn exactly who is prescribing what to whom and i assure you that nothing can prepare you for what james managed to catch on film youll be sick 
then i contrast the criminal enterprise hillary is running with a montage of videos taken over a  year span of donald trump  and in each of the clips spanning all those years trump is asked about potentially running for the presidency some day some of the answers are  years old and all are spontaneous unlike the scripted and now we know totally false statements we consistently get from hillary it is painfully obvious the answers trump gives are genuine and from the heart 
love him or hate him good luck arguing that trump isnt authentic in the video you get a good look at who would be in the oval office and its not the caricature that team hillary has tried so hard to create on the other hand team hillarys behavior is utterly indefensible and she knows it which is why she runs like hell in the video below the second reporters begin to ask her about the recordings 
theres nowhere to run now though hillary you and your staff have a lot to answer for much of which is criminal in nature go figure

André du Pôle,american woman in bikini desecrates french catacombs for her female indiana jones brand,"why you should become a minimalist why you should become a minimalist february    comments lifestyle 
the most abused word in the english language is need if youre reading this post i contend there is little that you actually need beyond what you currently possess you have ample electricity to power your computer in a climatecontrolled environment with running water and food in your wellstocked refrigerator why then do you always hear people talking about how they need more stuff 
humans have a deeplyrooted drive to compete with each other and advertisers capitalize on this impulse take a moment to picture the average person that you meet what do they have to take pride in buying the newest thing allows them to join the club of consumers and for a fleeting moment to be measured on an equal playing field despite their personal shortcomings the internal pain of their lifes problems dissipates for the split second they can boast superiority over everyone who doesnt have the same shiny widget 
this conspicuous consumption creates a selffulfilling egoinvestment in the broken system although borrowing money for useless luxury purchases subjugates people into debt slavery the mentality is if i paid  for this hunk of metal and im working overtime to pay it off it must be worth it  and so are other things that the commercials are telling me to buy quite literally we are working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we dont need  
if youre reading this blog you are likely a male aged  who wants to do one or more of the following quit your job travel explore a locationindependent income get yourself in shape take charge of a relationship and learn valuable life skills a minimalist mentality helps you do all of these things 
having fewer possessions forces you to properly place a higher value on experiences this will make it safer and more fulfilling to travel because you are in touch with what truly makes you happy if youre working on a side hustle or starting a business the desire for needless possessions drains your disposable income levels and prevents you from taking risks if my business fails will i have to give up my car lease preempt this loss aversion by having less to lose 
if you want to move to a better city with a higher cost of living having excess stuff sets a floor on how much rent youll pay to house your crap and in turn how much you can spend on leisure activities if youre a distractable person like me removing visual noise from your area makes you more likely to create things with your mind and less likely to fixate on your environment  
throwing or giving useless things away is a good first step since possessions have a psychic weight that you may not realize until you rid yourself of them to fully embrace this mindset you must also kill the desires that have been inculcated in you since birth cut down on your consumer impressions by watching less tv and trying to rationally dissect the techniques used in the few advertisements you encounter find fulfillment in hobbies and work rather than chasing the rush and eventual hedonic adaptation from consuming much like a drug successive bouts of consumerism create a higher baseline where your overall happiness is no different but you end up having a bunch of useless crap that ties you down 
girls can also be troublesome in this endeavor ever notice that when a girl spends extended time in your living space she beings to tell you that you need a new this or a replacement that a good friend once told me all human beings have an innate desire to create  most women cant so they redecorate limit your exposure to women who attempt to thwart a separation from consumerism ironically men likely to lead a minimalistnomadic lifestyle are simply more attractive to primesmv women think about whether the starving artist or the bottle service guy throwing money around ends up getting more ass as always watch how women behave rather than listening to what they say when they are protesting your lifestyle change 
ask yourself this if your house burned down and you had nothing but the clothes on your back what would you be worth to society and to yourself how would you feel about losing all of the possessions you own most people plugged into the matrix would rather die than think about replacing aunt gladyss vase or baby pictures they havent looked at in a decade this is an illusion once you begin to divorce yourself from this emotional investment to stuff you will implicitly place more value on your skills and past experiences 
minimalism is not a synonym for frugality or cheapness i dont wear a potato sack while pedaling a used tricycle to work every day  i simply choose to allocate my money to experiences and a few possessions that will fulfill me and advance my lifes purpose rather than enslave myself into debt for trinkets that will collect dust somewhere 
taking the red pill is about learning to separate your priorities and desires from those that society forces upon you i dont promise that adopting this mindset will make everybody happy but it will certainly help to clarify what contributes to your individual sense of self and will allow you to focus on the internal and external traits that exemplify a man of value",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,85.75523622326341,87,13,5246,915,4.711475409836066,915.0,0.7656230244937624,0.5495749667938356,0.5998375391851586,0.6564730714814335,-0.3727002371820277,0.6834185734999422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.2221,0.095,0.088,0.816,Negative,Weak

wow panasonic definitely wishes it could rewind the clock on this one chances are when youre trying to stay competitive as one of the worlds foremost electronics companies the last thing you want is for tens of thousands of your televisions to drift skyward into paradise 
weve got to give credit where credit is due at least panasonic had the decency to admit that they let their customers down the company has issued a public apology and in a drastic move the president of the company kazuhiro tsuga chose to resign in the wake of this scandal speaking at a press conference this morning tsuga issued the following statement 
after much consideration i have chosen to step down as the president of panasonic corp if i could i would travel to heaven and retrieve each and every one of these televisions i would kill any angel who tried to stop me from carrying these tvs out of paradise and returning them to our loyal panasonic customers on earth even if i saw god sitting on one of our missing dx flatscreens i would shove the lord off of the tv so that i could retrieve it for our customers unfortunately i do not have the power to travel to heaven and so i am left with no choice but to resign my position 
tsugas resignation is a nice gesture but it doesnt bring back a swarm of televisions from heaven panasonics reputation has been severely tarnished by the rapturing of their televisions whoever steps up to become panasonics new president is going to have to do everything they can to prevent any of their products from ascending to heaven ever again",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,69,10,2538,445,4.680898876404495,445.0,0.2152723163182744,-0.0141271790859303,-0.1166225418704298,-0.0803368998485519,-0.4028762770184221,-0.0706177259292682,0.0089887640449438,0.0,0.0022471910112359,0,2,0.0,0.0185051061721481,0.9484,0.171,0.139,0.69,Positive,Very Strong

Tim Brown,texas police arrest trump voter for wearing deplorable tshirt,"posted on october   by tim brown 
on monday a man who voted for donald trump was arrested for wearing a tshirt that referenced hillary clinton s comments about trump supporters being  deplorables  to the polls 
brett mauthe  was arrested after he went to the polls wearing a protrump hat and a shirt that read  basket of deplorables  
according to ksat  mauthe removed his hat at the request of those who were overseeing the polls however since the tshirt did not violate the election code he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it 
subsequently he was arrested and charged with electioneering 
ksat  reports  
bulverde police chief gary haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details instead he deferred to comal countys election coordinator cynthia jaqua 
jaqua said the offense of electioneering isnt limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs violations can be committed by voters as well 
it can mean a tshirt a button a hat you know she said anything related to the voting the party the candidate 
jaqua declined to release specific details about mauthes arrest 
jaqua is quoted by my san antonio  
its in the election code electioneering is prohibited within a foot marker you cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons tshirts hats whatever else or carrying signs she said 
most people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail she added 
every election we have to advise people even if its a school bond issue they wear candidates shirts and we just have to remind them please go into the restroom and turn it inside out this is the first time i recall someone getting arrested she said during two decades working at the county election office 
a gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for trump and when i asked him to please take it off he was real nice and took it off she added while working a polling site thursday afternoon in new braunfels 
so according to this nonsense a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day but if a politician makes reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day this is utterly ridiculous 
my question on all of that is what happened to free speech is that recognized as a godgiven right in the first amendment i mean i realize that the constitution is to restrict the federal government but honestly shouldnt the states recognize the right of free speech even in a polling place seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected 
other voters agree with me 
i dont feel like you should be preaching to anybody but i do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate georgina pereida said after casting her vote im kind of shocked because i think thats part of the freedoms that were voting for 
jose tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are  and vote again i ask why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech its not inflammatory it isnt a lie it isnt slander whats illegal about it 
ill tell you politicians want to control people and this is one of many means they use to do that this is what happens when you dont hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose 
mauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media 
the reason im not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around and i dont want to give you any comment he said  
the charged of electioneering is a class c misdemeanor

admin,hillary takes a cookie from a little person on univision gets tequila and a huge birthday cake practices spanish dances salsa and gets called a home girl in doanything bid to crush trump in florida,"end of the american dream october   
if you want to see war without end vote for hillary clinton it is tremendously ironic that hillary clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray donald trump as dangerous and temperamental because it is clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable 
she has a temper that is absolutely legendary and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades  hillary clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in syria thanks to her libya is a postapocalyptic wasteland today and now she is picking a fight with the russians before she has even won the election of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as hillary clinton and if she wins the election i am fully convinced that world war  will begin before her time in the white house is over 
someone that shares this opinion with me is donald trump according to reuters  trump recently stated that we are going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton 
on syrias civil war trump said clinton could drag the united states into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict 
clinton has called for the establishment of a nofly zone and safe zones on the ground to protect noncombatants some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the united states into direct conflict with russian fighter jets 
what we should do is focus on isis we should not be focusing on syria said trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his trump national doral golf resort youre going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton 
in order to have a nofly zone in syria you would have to enforce it 
and in order to enforce it you would have to be willing to shoot at the russians 
according to national intelligence director james clapper  that could have dire consequences 
russia could shoot down a us aircraft if a nofly zone were imposed over syria national intelligence director james clapper said tuesday 
i wouldnt put it past them to shoot down an american aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground clapper said speaking with cbs charlie rose at the council on foreign relations in new york about several national security issues 
of course clapper is not alone in that assessment the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford says that imposing a nofly zone over all of syria would require us to go to war  
right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make  senate armed services committee september   emphasis added 
but hillary clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants 
you see the truth is that hillary clinton wants to win the war that she started in syria back in  she spearheaded an effort along with saudi arabia and turkey to try to use the arab spring uprisings in the middle east as an opportunity to try to overthrow president assad in syria if it wasnt for her meddling millions of refugees would not be pouring into europe and elsewhere and there would be no humanitarian crisis in syria at all 
thanks to russian intervention the war in syria is not too far from being over but the obama administration is desperate to keep it going they understand that if assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted and that is why they are so determined to keep aleppo from falling without aleppo many of the jihadist rebels that the obama administration has been supporting wont have anywhere to hide 
so the obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the syrian military and the russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen  if obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against syrian forces and the russians start shooting back that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control 
one recent survey found that current american leadership has a  percent approval rating in russia right now and the russians dislike hillary clinton even more than they dislike barack obama the russians know that if hillary clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us and that is why they desperately want donald trump to win in november you can see this outlook reflected in comments that russian president vladimir putin recently made about the two candidates  
mrs clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country against russia mr trump on the other hand calls for cooperation  at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism putin said 
naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us and we consider it wrong that we always have to be in conflict with one another creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world putin noted 
anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that hillary clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for russia the thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate but it may soon become a reality 
and even now the obama administration and our nato allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with moscow this week it is being reported that nato troops will soon be sent to poland estonia latvia and lithuania  nine hundred us troops are to be sent to eastern europe next year as americas troubled relationship with russia enters new uncertain territory a usled battle group of nato allied soldiers will be sent to poland as part of the multination operation british forces will lead one of the four battle groups in estonia canada will spearhead the presence in latvia and germany will be present in lithuania 
in addition infowars is reporting that us marines will soon be stationed in norway near the border with russia 
after accepting a pentagon proposal norway will host us marines at a base near the russian border as russia deploys nuclearcapable ships to kaliningrad 
a rotating force of approximately  marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of vaernes just outside trondheim beginning in january norway and russia share an mile border in the arctic 
the us initiative to augment their training and exercises in norway by locating a marine corps rotational force in norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship said norwegian defense minister ine eriksen søreide 
most americans arent aware of any of this nor do they really care about our relationship with russia 
but in russia things are completely different the possibility of war with the united states is the biggest news story over there these days  and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation  
russian authorities have stepped up nuclearwar survival measures amid a showdown with washington dusting off sovietera civildefense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities 
at the kremlins ministry of emergency situations the cold war is back 
the country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the ussr with what officials said were  million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats 
i know that i have been writing about this over and over  but the truth is that we are on a path to war with russia and the election of hillary clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war 
in my controversial new book  i expressed my belief that war with russia is coming but at the time that i wrote it i didnt know how the election would turn out 
at this point it looks like clinton is very likely to win on november th and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with russia 
if you are reading this and you are considering voting for hillary clinton please dont do it  we simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the white house at this critical time

Robert Spencer,the splcs libelous new report on antimuslim extremists,"originally published by the jerusalem post  
in one of the immortal lines of godfather   mafia boss michael corleone discusses the fate of his brother who betrayed him with his enforcer i dont want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive corleone said 
message received the brother was murdered after their mothers funeral last week it was reported that the obama administration has delivered a message to the palestinian authority the administration has warned the pa that the us will veto any antiisrael resolution brought before the un security council before the us presidential elections on november  message received open season on israel at the security council will commence november  the palestinians are planning appropriately israel needs to plan too israels most urgent diplomatic mission today is to develop and implement a strategy that will outflank president barack obama in his final eight weeks in power lobbying the administration is pointless obama has waited eight years to exact his revenge on israel for not supporting his hostile strategically irrational policies and he has no interest in letting bygones be bygones before turning to what israel must do first we need to understand what israel can do a good place to begin is by considering what just transpired at unesco where twice in a week unesco bodies resolved to erase  years of jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount the fight that israel waged at unesco is not the fight it needs to wage at the security council the stakes at the security council are far higher like the un general assembly unescos decisions are nonbinding declarations that have no legal or operational significance as such there is no reason to expend great resources to fight them for israel the goal of the fight at unesco is not to defeat antiisrael initiatives that is impossible given the palestinians automatic majority the purpose of the fight at unesco is to humiliate european governments that side with antisemitic initiatives and to weaken the congenitally antiisrael body itself the government achieved both of these objectives italian prime minister matteo renzis disavowal of his own governments abstention from the vote on the first resolution  like the similar position taken after the fact by the mexican government  was a diplomatic victory for israel so too the fact that unescos own secretarygeneral irina bukova felt compelled to disavow her own agencys actions by rejecting the resolutions denial of the jewish peoples ties to jerusalem was a significant victory for israel her statement was deeply damaging for unesco and its reputation finally the fact that tanzania and the philippines voted against the resolution was a testament to israels capacity to convince other governments to abandon their traditional propalestinian voting pattern the palestinians won the vote at unesco because they are more powerful diplomatically than israel they have an automatic antiisrael majority but they werent empowered by their victory to the contrary they were bloodied by it in a sign of their weakening hold on member nations the palestinians and jordanians felt compelled to send a threatening letter to the members of unescos world heritage committee lest they dare to vote against the resolution powerful players dont make threats they dont need to israels experience at unesco teaches us that there are governments that are open to counteroffers israel doesnt need to hide in americas shadow it is capable of working on its own to blunt the impact of the palestinians automatic majority and it will need to use all of its resources to fend off a usbacked assault at the security council unlike unesco the security council can pass legally binding resolutions israel needs to be prepared to bring all of its resources to bear to prevent such a resolution from being adopted against it obamas intention to abandon israel at the security council means that israel comes to this battle severely hobbled but there is one advantage to the uss betrayal over the years israels ability to trust the us to veto antiisrael resolutions at the security council was been a mixed blessing on the one hand the us has secured israel from diplomatic assaults but on the other hand our ability to trust washington has made us diplomatically lazy and ineffective safe in washingtons shadow we have behaved as through all diplomacy is public diplomacy that is we have pretended that statecraft begins and ends with making the moral or strategic case for our side against the other guys but public diplomacy is just one diplomatic tool the syrian regime for instance has no moral case for securing international support bashar assad didnt convince russian president vladimir putin to support him by arguing that he is better than alternative regimes he bought putins support by offering him permanent air and naval bases in syria then there is morocco another weak state with no public diplomacy case to make last march un secretarygeneral ban kimoon outraged rabat when he acknowledged the plain fact that western sahara which morocco occupies is occupied territory morocco quickly secured the support of spain and france and launched an allout onslaught against ban how did morocco manage moroccos most powerful diplomatic resource is its control over migration flows from north africa to europe anytime it wishes rabat can open the migratory floodgates just as easily as it can keep them shut and the french and spanish know it in less than a month ban issued repeated abject apologies game set match morocco from reports to date it appears that shortly after the us elections on november  the malaysians or egyptians will submit a palestinianbacked resolution that defines israeli communities in united jerusalem judea and samaria as illegal if the resolution is brought to a vote the us will fail to veto it such a resolution or a resolution obligating israel to withdraw to the  armistice lines would cause israel grave harm so what resources does israel have to prevent this from happening of course we have public diplomacy and that might work with some friendly nations but it wont get us over the top we need to learn from the syrian and moroccan examples and consider what we have to offer security council members in exchange for their support in scuttling the approaching onslaught against us one such resource is the us congress israels allies in congress are sickened by the obama administrations devastating middle east policies a solid majority of lawmakers can be trusted to support actions that will reinforce israels position israel has other resources as well that we can trade on we have natural gas and we have technologies that the governments of the world require to surmount the challenges of the  century there is no reason to give these resources away when we can trade them for diplomatic support as for the palestinians as the unesco vote showed they are less popular now than at any time in the past  years all they have to offer is threats and antisemitism both are powerful weapons but they are no longer invincible israels goal must be to use our resources at the security council in a manner that will make it impossible for obama to enable an antiisrael resolution to pass a method for achieving this goal has two components the first component is to convince a friendly country on the security council to propose a balanced resolution that would counter the palestinianbacked israelbashing one such a resolution could include four points first it could deplore efforts to deny jewish history in jerusalem and the temple mount second it can condemn the paplo for their continued unlawful funding of terrorists third it can urge israel to restrain settlement construction in areas that in previous negotiations have been identified as likely territory for a future palestinian state fourth it can call on israel and the pa to reinstate negotiations immediately without preconditions israel has friendly ties with a few security council members among them uruguay and new zealand in the final weeks of the obama era it is possible that israel will be able to convince one of them to submit a balanced resolution along these lines obama would be hardpressed to oppose such a resolution in favor of one that singles israel out for rebuke but that still is insufficient obama can make uruguay and new zealand a better offer if he wishes and so we move to the second aspect of the plan if we learn nothing else from the obama era we must recognize that the time has come for israel to stop sufficing with just one security council veto most states have several and we need a few more russia today is the best place to start our search for a second veto putin is a dealmaker as his agreement with assad showed he is willing to consider attractive offers obviously israel wont offer russia bases but we do have other things to offer putin in exchange for a veto for instance in exchange for a russian veto at the security council israel can offer putin to lobby the us congress to cancel us sanctions against russia over russias annexation of crimea israel has no dog in that fight and the sanctions are not getting the us anywhere putin might go for the deal for two reasons first by stepping into the breach and defending israel against obama he will humiliate obama second if israel succeeds with the congress he will reap economic rewards for his part putin wouldnt even have to openly side with israel all he would have to do is announce that in the interests of regional stability russia will not support an unbalanced resolution on israel and the palestinians if putin supports a balanced resolution obama will be checkmated his plan to take revenge on israel for not following him off the strategic cliff will be foiled israel will have survived his presidency none of this will be easy and success is far from assured there are many more ways for israel to fail than succeed our diplomatic weakness remains a millstone around our neck but as the unesco resolutions showed attacking israel is no longer cost free we are not powerless in the grip of circumstances we have cards to play and now is the time to play them for all they are worth",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,85.16960871803,54,8,10248,1725,4.933333333333334,1725.0,-0.2433532738279656,-0.3899286096724409,1.9232250301157543,1.926294511433111,-0.1537482244414074,1.9829279406013471,0.001159420289855,0.0,0.0005797101449275,0,1,0.0,0.0024624517009931,0.9982,0.151,0.098,0.75,Positive,Very

Isabelle Z.,fast food combo meals tied to kids overconsumption of highcalorie drinks,"food poverty  million americans struggle to put food on the table as obamas economic schemes collapse 
wednesday november   by j d heyes tags food poverty  hunger  obama administration naturalnews a democratic presidential nominee  hillary clinton who is by far the establishment candidate in this years presidential race  wants to take over from another democratic president barack obama she is promising to carry on his successful economic policies by promising to essentially double down on them and yet by any true measure the economy has been a disaster under obama real growth has nearly flatlined  real unemployment figures  when a proper count is taken  is far higher than what is being officially posted by the administration  and  million americans cannot get enough food without government assistancein fact on that last point and as reported by natural blaze  in the obama economy in americans are going to bed hungry on most nights if not every nightand clinton wants to double down on obamas economic policies how can such a great economic recovery produce so many hungry americans for the past eight years americans have had to listen to lectures from obama and other democrats about how we as a firstworld nation should be able to afford things like healthcare and offer a free college education to our citizens and increasingly to noncitizens  but shouldnt a nation that produces so much excess food each year that we export it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars be able to feed its people tooof course but malnutrition during the great economic recovery of the obama years is rising at an alarming rate in the us thats because in real terms workers wages are falling and it is becoming more difficult for families and individuals to earn enough to put decent food on their tablesfor many particularly the low paid sic this means two things fuel and food poverty  natural blaze reportedlow salaries combined with stagnant wages jobs going to illegal immigrants and parttime work rising as obamacare forces fewer companies to retain fulltime employees mean that food is increasingly seen as a luxury and of those who can still afford food many have to settle for cheap nutritionpoor junk foods and foods high in starches carbohydrates and calories now winter approaches and with it the inevitable supply challenges of natural gas and heating oil which traditionally produce higher pricesbut the establishment media is part of the problem for example in february bloomberg reported that in americans were on food stamps despite an economic recovery  no one should ever be hungry in america unless they choose to be what recovery obamas economy is growing at about  percent a quarter  far below what is needed to sustain economic growth to the extent that it would lower our debt and provide wellpaying jobs to the tens of millions needing themso the caveat is disingenuous a more accurate story would have reflected on the in figure as it pertained to a real lack of opportunity among americans to find better employment opportunities in fact the story makes no sense when you analyze it either the economy is really good and a in ratio is no big deal or the ratio is a big deal because the socalled economic recovery isnt reaching enough people which is itits the latter of course and while america will always have a portion of the population that is too sick too old or too lazy to produce  and they will be a net drain on the treasury  the goal of any administration ought to be to adopt sound financial policies or to rescind policies that serve as impediments to economic growth in todays america that generally means thinning out the massive bureaucracy that is not only robbing millions of a better life because of their negative impact on business and industry but is actually causing them to go hungryand that should never happen in america so why is it sources",naturalnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,5.169608718030007,72,11,3894,659,4.878603945371776,659.0,0.3069974343475224,0.1737735362073249,0.242136641996401,0.255146789225101,-0.2077607630127105,0.272709440193819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.7653,0.088,0.095,0.817,Negative,Very Strong
WATCH: My Summer Vacation In Croatia,comment on  tips for having sex with croatian girls by watch my summer vacation in croatia,"over the last decades south korea has emerged as one of the wealthiest countries in all of asia currently the oecd country is roughly on the same material and economic level as other affluent east asian nations such as japan hong kong and taiwan however it appears now as perhaps the most potentially strong among them south korea seems more dynamic and willful than its larger neighbor and economic main rival japan which perhaps has entered the path of a more longterm decline
in this article i do briefly describe the main characteristics of contemporary south korea and also reflect upon various cultural subtopics which are of importance for any male who is interested in to obtain more sophisticated knowledge about nonwestern cultures and what they might and might not offer
the emergence of modern south korea culturally politically technologically and economically south korean development during the th century onward cannot be understood without to mention the strong ties to japan and the united states as much as japan suppressed korea between  the material progression is nevertheless a direct and indirect consequence of the traumatic colonial period korean leaders were also inspired by the japanese military dictatorship which in turn was influenced by european militarism after south koreawhich was formed in  after the divide of the countrystopped relying on american aid and focused on its own potential the economy grew rapidly due to an effective exportoriented industrialization
democracy was gradually introduced in  but some of these authoritarian residues are still visible in todays society the military in particular but also with regard to how many companies are run
presently the economicpolitical relationships between south korea and japan remain flexible and pragmatic for the sake of both countries the ties to the us seems less problematic although koreans negotiate between on one hand a more distinguished korean culture and on the other further western influences
additional ambivalence might also be a result of that some koreans regard american relations as a hinder in the process of a future reunification between the two korean nations generally though the political military and economic cooperation between south korea and the us appears fruitful and to the benefit of both sides
the korean wave and the rising appeal of south korea 
for quite a long time modern south korea may be regarded as not much more than a smaller version of japan although with a unique language and some other differentiating characteristics in postmillennial times however this picture has gradually shiftedboth among other asians westerners and people in other continents tootowards a more appealing national image
the reason for this is mainly material related to a refined development of technology samsung pop music kpop tv dramas kdrama cosmetic products kbeauty and perhaps also a more exciting metropolitan nightlife and a better ranked top university seoul national university the korean wave hallyu covers a whole plethora of different expressions of the rising popularity of south korean products and celebrities and it has had spillover effects for other sectors such as academia and tourism for instance more people are interested in learning korean than  or  years ago
the nightlife in the capital seoul is unhesitatingly of very high standard for instance this year dj mag ranks club octagon in gangnam as the fifth best night club in the entire world  in the city regions gangnam hongdae and itaewon in particular both foreigners and locals can easily find bars and clubs of various sizes that offer highquality entertainment and which conform to a relatively broad spectrum of tastes in music and dress style
cultural characteristics contempory south korean culture can be described as a hybrid of korean east asian and western culture as i have stated above south korea has been influenced by japan and the us in particular to a significant extent this means that the similar real or quasihierarchical structures as in for instance china and japan are visible in south korea too one is expected to speak and behave in different ways depending on a persons age or social rank which are more or less explicitly stated
this does largely overlap a meritocratic social structure rather than status being a primarily inherited factor a doctor is looked upon as socially more valuable than a regular office worker regardless of family background it is thus not much left of the old confucian system
the korean languageeven though about  of the words are based on chinese words and its grammar being partly similar to japaneseis unique with all its different suffixes that in turn conform to different speech and writing levels these can be more or less formal plain and polite but are always related to the social relations and contexts of either speaking or writing people who know each other well tend to use an intimate speech style haeche but in some contexts such as the workplace they might change to a more formal and polite level haeyoche when they walk to other people many who learn korean at a beginners level start with haeyoche and then gradually broaden the scope to include other levels of speaking and writing
apart from the korean language a foreigner may find many things in south korea that are either similar to places such as japan and hong kong or to the western world south korea especially seoul is largely the product of globalization and as a wealthy country this goes along with high standards of infrastructure and general quality of life as a hightech nation it appears as being in the forefront of material development often outshining its western counterparts at least in some ways
the present culture especially the more youthoriented culture is safe and relaxed only slight modifications in dress and behavior towards more politeness and moderation makes any westerner fit in well at least short termwise and to only speak english is seldom a real obstacle
if a person digs deeper into korean history and cultureand geographically move outside the seoul metropolitan areaone may find many differentiating and even somewhat unique characteristics although these do often have china as its root or point of departure but apart from buddhismwhich is separated rather than integrated into the larger societythese elements are seldom manifested in present time there are obviously many real buddhists and christians in present south korea but the traditional layers of culture tend to be mere relics of the past with that said the country as a whole is overall more socially conservative than many western counterparts

whether or not the trend towards increased westernization will continue remains an open question but in terms of technology and popular culture it is unlikely that south korea will look in other directions in the near future after all much of its present infrastructure and popular culture makes it into pretty much a local version of the westernglobal society
lastly two other things that have direct implications for any foreign person who reflects upon the option to stay longer in south korea than as a tourist temporary employee or exchange student is that  the population is very homogeneous and  it has no explicit will to change this fact
this means that it is difficult although not totally impossible to obtain a citizenship if you are not of korean descent south korea uses a type of partial jas sanguinis  citizenship by the blood it is not very uncommon these days that korean men get married to and have children with for instance southeast asian women such as filipinas and south korea is gradually shifting towards a more multiethnic society however compared to many western countries the levels of ethnic and genetic heterogeneity are much much smaller
due to the legal difficulties and cultural differences especially languagewise it is definitely not a smooth process to become naturalized as a korean citizen or resident permanent and temporary living are generally two very different things and south korea is yet another palpable manifestation of that
women in south korea phenotypically south korean women are similar to those of other east asian populations as a result of drastically improved nutrition younger south koreans are relatively tall seemingly not much shorter on average than their western counterparts the levels of obesity are slightly rising but still very low compared to the us canada and even thinner european countries such as italy and sweden overall korean femalesespecially girlscan be characterized as moderately tall and slim
additionally a significant share cares a lot about their appearances fashion diet hair style and makeup are all very important in everyday life and although these things change rapidly due to new trends and seasonal shifts many will ride along the same wave wherever it goes collectivism is quite striking in that respect and subcultures are not as widespread and visible as in japan many look about the same
as with many phenomena in life the extent to which a person likes or dislikes how a population generally appears is related to individual taste with that said i think that more objectively speaking the two main strengths of korean girls and younger women are that they are relatively thin and wellgroomed they do everything they can to optimize their beauty potentials sometimes even with the help of plastic surgery which will make them look somewhat more european which partly is an ideal among east asian populations

additionallyeven if this stems more from observations and anecdotes than general factsthey tend to be more polite and welleducated in a positive sense than western females this is something they also have in common with other well off asians such as japanese taiwanese and singaporeans in the more exciting locations of seoul one will find quite many pretty and decent korean girls and even though hookup culture has for good and for bad penetrated the south of the korean peninsula a significant share of these females may be looked upon as serious girlfriend material
western guys do have a comparative advantage in terms of looks and even sometimes behavior korean guys tend to lack the cockiness of westerners but these automatic benefits should not be overemphasized many of the things that girls are attracted to such as confidence extroversion and good looks are general close to universal traits if one is a loser in the west then one will probably be that in the east as well conversely the more alpha males will magnify their results if they have the proper time and opportunity to do so
conclusion overall south korea is a rather impressive modern society that shares many of the good features with its equally rich neighbors however recently it has seemingly surpassed places like japan and hong kong in terms of material development nightlife and popular culture for some western males between the ages of  south korea might offer a valuable opportunity for temporaryranging from weeks to even years and circular migration because eventually it is most likely time to go home regardless if one wishes it or not

Corbett,interview   the asiapacific perspective with broc west,"corbett     comment 
on friday october th  fbi director james comey dropped a political bombshell just  days out from the presidential selection 
many theories have so far been floated about why the fbi director issued this letter just days before a national selection some of them including the idea that comey is struggling against an internal insurrection of agents disgruntled by his earlier decision not to prosecute clinton seem to have a basis in reality others including the idea that comey is an agent of the russians working in collusion with putin and trump to put a kremlin puppet in the white house do not 
but what seemingly everyone has missed with regard to the letter is that it was issued just four days after another bombshell piece of information

milestone in america with the revelation that dirty donna brazile a dnc operative working for clinton smuggled debate questions out of cnn and handed them over to the clinton camp before the debates ever took place so that hillary clinton could cheatyes hillary clinton cheated in the debates as ive said all along they were  rigged by cnn the clinton news network which now functions as the propaganda front of the criminal clinton cartel seeking to steal power by crushing the very concept of open fair and free elections in americacnn commentator donna brazile who is now the chair of the

intimidate their way to power election after election they live as legally immune parasites feeding off the blood sweat and tears of the american middle class who are barely staying afloat while washington elitists like brazile abedin and clinton dine on luxury meals like a disturbing scene out of the hunger games but its not president snow we have to worry about in the real world its the haunting possibility of a president clinton why we the people must never allow hillary clinton to seize the white house we the people must never allow hillary clinton to seize the white house we must halt this sociopathic liar and cheater at the ballot box on november th and once thats accomplished we must petition president trump to relentlessly pursue criminal indictments of the hundreds of seditious traitors inside the clinton regime who have blatantly violated numerous federal laws to commit massive fraud and attempted theft of power across americathere are literally hundreds of these democrat criminals who need to be locked up for life they are a danger to democracy and a danger to a free society they are sociopaths liars cheats and even murderers they are fraudsters and political con artists who prey upon the weakminded ie democrats who are still so stupid and clueless that theyre voting for hillary  if we dont stop them now they threaten to turn america into a fourth reich  complete with the mass murder of political dissidents and the silencing of all critics of the clinton regimethese democrats like dirty donna brazile want to run america like haiti  complete with all the corruption bribery scandals and economic collapse that third world countries routinely sufferbut filthy scumbags like brazile are about to find out something rather shocking we the people wont tolerate your lies and corruption any longer we the people are going to arrest you indict you prosecute you and see you and your coconspirators behind bars where you belong the trump movement is awakening tens of millions of americans to the astonishing criminality of the democrats in washington theres an unstoppable movement rising up in america now that simply will not tolerate filthy democrats stealing our democracy and conning their way into power if they steal the election we will take to the streets and declare a clinton presidency illegitimate and illegal  we will stand behind the military men and women in uniform as the us armed forces depose you and remove you from office  to announce new elections without the festering cancerous stench of the dnc and the clintons hanging over this nation like a putrid cloud of filthwe the people have had enough of you demons you creatures from hell you walking bags of antihuman reptilian snakes who pretend to be leaders in washington

corruption and wretched government racketsfrom breitbartcom  racketeering former prosecutor andrew mccarthy has recently observed that hillary clintons abuse of the state department looks an awful lot like a racketeering enterprise which could trigger the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act of  more widely known as rico mccarthy explainedunder rico an enterprise can be any association of people informal or formal illegitimate or legitimate  it could be a mafia family an ostensibly charitable foundation or a department of government it is a racketeering enterprise if its affairs are conducted through a pattern of racketeering activity a pattern means merely two or more violations of federal or state law these violations constitute racketeering activity if they are included among the extensive list of felonies laid out in the statute its time to defeat clinton  followed by arresting all the clinton operatives and initiating hundreds of federal prosecution cases against these third world fraudsters thats how we take back america restore democracy and regain public trust in law and order note to the feds arrest the democrat criminals or lose any semblance of legal authority in america remember if federal authorities do not arrest and prosecute the clintons and all their coconspirators they essentially forfeit any real claim to legitimate legal authority at that point the citizens will realize they no longer have any logical obligation to pay federal taxes obey federal laws abide by federal regulations or consent to be governed by anybody in washington at allafter all a nation run by a system that refuses to hold its leaders accountable for their criminal conduct is a nation that can no longer claim to operate under the rule of law at that point justice becomes a sad tragic joke against the citizens and the nation soon finds itself on the verge of a mass citizens revolt if the fbi wont seek criminal indictments against hillary

so the nypd opened up a case on hillary the fbi said no well take that  and that is the only reason why these investigations got reopened because if the nypd handled it huge portions of the fbi would be sent to prison now the fbi is under pressure to actually do its job because they know the nypd knows no matter what the outcome the fbi gains zero  zero credibility points from this 

so read my report do not forgive  it was bang on they did this because they had to not because they had any intention at all of being good and it really is time to drain the swamp 

now lets all sit and wait for the suicide of preet bharara  the us prosecuting attorney for the southern district of new york and the nypd who pushed this into the light hes now a target of the fbi the dnc the clinton death machine and god knows what else prediction and i do not make predictions the director of investigations for the nypd will commit suicide within  days hes a walking dead man 

the circle of crime in washington dc is so entrenched and so intertwined that if you poke one part of it there is a good chance the whole show will fall apart poking that monster in a way that hurts is something i do not believe anyone will survive preet might as well call himself a zombie 

the nypd trumped the fbi that is why they had to investigate hillary 

well well the nypd is what busted the hillary mails open while they were looking for kiddie stuff on weiners laptop and that is why the fbi was forced to investigate hillary they had no choice nypd trumps fbi

it looks like presidentelect donald trump is wasting no time making his mark on washington hes already gotten to work appointing his new cabinet members and laying the groundwork for his new administration and if it wasnt already clear that things are going to be done trumps way for the next four years donald trump just whispered hope you like to make ham motherfucker to a white house executive chef 
wow it looks like washington is going to be a very different place under president trump 
those who witnessed the encounter say that during a recent visit to the white house trump caught sight of a highranking member of the white house kitchen waved him over and said come here let me talk to you a minute in a voice that was somehow both cordial and threatening when the chef got close to trump the presidentelect shook his hand pulled him close and began whispering that once he got sworn in the chef would be doing nothing but cooking him ham  
members of the white house staff overheard the phrases ham is your life now idiot and i dont care what else you can cook i only want ham as trump whispered to the chef whose eyes grew wide with silent fear as he listened to what our nations newest president was telling him they also say that trump briefly smiled to wave to photographers before turning back to the chef with a dark and menacing expression on his face to continue whispering about ham 
now thats the sign of a president who isnt afraid to shake things up 
while many americans are deeply troubled by the bigoted rhetoric of trumps presidential campaign those who voted for him as a protest against the political establishment have got to be pretty happy about a story like this one no other president would grab a white house chef by the hand and whisper you live in ham world now motherfucker 
and it seems as if presidentelect trump has a concrete plan in place as well trump didnt just tell the white house chef that he wanted ham in general he had specific types of ham that he wanted including baked ham smoked ham all the time and ham with frosting trump was also overheard telling the white house chef youre also going to be making something called a pork jackhammer which i just invented during the limo ride over here its incredibly dangerous to make and i want to eat it every day 
it definitely looks like this is going to be a new era in washington you just know its not going to be business as usual in dc anymore when donald trump isnt afraid to look a white house chef right in the eye and say when i ask for chinese food that just means soy sauce on ham when i ask for sushi thats raw ham president trump will be eating barges of ham for breakfast lunch and dinner the moment i take the oath of office is the moment that your world becomes a porkfueled hellscape 
people who voted for trump wanted a maverick and it looks like they got one 
after about two minutes of whispering hamrelated threats trump stepped away from the chef and began smiling and waving at the surrounding press as if nothing had happened but his message was clear when donald trump becomes president hes going to play by his own rules and hes only going to eat ham if president trump has his way life in the white house might become completely unrecognizable",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,78,16,3274,602,4.421926910299003,602.0,0.4904476704060184,1.1132771126736014,0.0781022068950476,0.1657889841914645,-0.6584562100150064,0.1812624847311275,0.0016611295681063,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0025084326421819,0.6355,0.089,0.078,0.833,Positive,Strong

hi david 
we have been told and we are preparing to report that the fbi has taken possession of the thumb drive that was once in your possession this is what we have been informed and we wanted to see whether there was any sort of comment that could be provided if you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed then i would gladly accept that as well  but we have solid reason to believe this wed welcome any comment you can offer thanks very much 
eric associated press reporter says he knows its true but will gladly print that its false 
whats truly astonishing in this email is how ap reporter eric tucker says he will gladly lie to cover for the clintons  in plain english he explains that he has solid reason to believe the report about the thumb drive but he will gladly publish a false narrative via the associated press  and he even suggests what that false narrative should be if you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed then i would gladly accept that as well 
in other words hes not just corrupt dishonest and fraudulent as a journalist hes also suggesting the false narrative the clintons should use 
this is the exact same way the ap talks to the cdc about vaccines and measles by the way essentially the associated press reporters say we are total media whores we will bend over and grab our ankles while you shove your fake story down the throats of our readers who foolishly think were a credible news organization 
you gotta love eric tucker for this the guy takes the prize for finally spelling out in black and white what weve known for years the ap is a total joke when it comes to real journalism  note carefully that the ap wont even fire tucker for this admission hell probably get a prize of some sort how many other associated presstitutes have deliberately lied to cover up clinton crimes 
it all brings to mind the obvious question how many other associated presstitutes deliberately lied to cover up clinton crimes 
just what percentage of ap stories about the clinton scandals are actually fake news pretending to be credible journalism answer probably about  
its not just ap either its the same story at every other mainstream news organization across america theyre all liars and crooks and theyre all working for hillary clinton the serial killer and rape excuser

Daniel Greenfield,obama donations funneled through fake bonuses,"exassistant fbi director clintons are a crime family october   
thats quite an endorsement  and if theres anything top fbi officials now its crime families certainly this is probably the first serious level of experience that hillary can claim in any field 
the clintons thats a crime family basically former assistant fbi director james kallstrom said its like organized crime i mean the clinton foundation is a cesspool 
kallstrom best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of twa flight  in the late s said that hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee was a pathological liar 
he also blasted attorney general loretta lynch claiming that she impeded the investigation into clintons private server 
the problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation he said thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that 
kallstrom also said that fbi director james comey and the rest of the fbis leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation not the rest of the bureau

Sean Colarossi,conservatives already plotting to block clintons scotus picks let court die out,"by rmuse on sat oct th  at  pm he is taking the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throwing them back in republicans faces   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
although this campaign season has been interesting to say the least there is something happening one never thought would occur after spending nearly eight years demonizing obstructing and criticizing every and anything about the president of the united states republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their  imagined  close ties to the democratic president whose approval rating and popularity are growing 
it is hypocritical to say the least and at some point a result of a toxic republican candidate for the presidency but for some gop candidates it is a very dangerous strategy if any republican believed president obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chiefs tolerance during an election 
the president is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate republicans for either  belated rejection  or continued support of donald trump president obama is also reminding republicans that  donald trump is the endpoint of eight years of gop toxic hostility  it may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that  obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every republican who ever crossed him  but he is getting some wellplaced and wellwarranted shots at republicans 
two republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the presidents approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics so it likely stunned the president that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed opposed and attempted to get rid of 
ohio senator rob portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the president to break the grip of heroin addiction president obama took the time to excoriate portman for 
 finally withdrawing his support from donald trump  but only  after looking at the polling now that its politically expedient but he has supported him up until last week so i guess it was ok when trump was attacking minorities and suggesting that mexicans were rapists  and insulting gold star moms making fun of disabled americans i guess that didnt quite tip it over the edge why was that ok and now he says he will vote for the vicepresidential nominee instead except that guy still supports donald trump  
the president was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the president  one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times california republican representative daryl issa is sending out campaign mailers with the presidents face on them and boasting about his close work with president obama  to protect victims of sexual assault  
daryl issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the presidents wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on issacreated scandals during a fundraiser in la jolla california sunday last the president assailed issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the presidents image on it the president said 
 issas primary contribution to the united states congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumpedup investigations that have led nowhere this is now a guy who because poll numbers are bad has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me now that is the definition of chutzpah 
as remarked by tim murphy at mother jones president obama is not just evening up the score with republicans who made his tenure miserable  he is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight yearsto take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in republicans faces  
the president clearly has a lot of  words  to harangue republicans with he said  
 heres the thing for years republican politicians and the farright media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me about hillary about harry they said i wasnt born here they said climate change is a hoax they said that i was going to take everybodys guns away they said that while we were doing military exercises that weve been doing forever suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law this is what theyve been saying for years now so people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe its true and if the world theyve been seeing is im powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybodys guns in the middle of the night and impose martial laweven though i cant talk without a prompterthen is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like donald trump 
and the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better there are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what thisll help rile up the base itll give us an excuse to obstruct what were trying to do we wont be able to appoint judges well gum up the works well create gridlock itll give us a political advantage so they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff so donald trump did not start this donald trump didnt start it he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it take credit for it and promote it thats what he always does and so now when suddenly its not working and people are saying wow this guys kind of out of line all of a sudden these republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly theyre all walking away oh this is too much so when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down suddenly thats a dealbreaker well what took you so long what the heck what took you so long all these years 
the mother jones piece made out like president obama is seeking retribution or  revenge  against republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years without knowing what goes on in the presidents head to motivate his campaign rhetoric that is a hard call to make with any surety barack obama does not strike one as being vindictive 
the president is though an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the white house is winding down and republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from donald trump it is prudent of the president to remind voters exactly what republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why donald trump is their standard bearer and why republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the white house",politicususa.com,Real,english,100.0,87.98166551253078,79,12,6880,1186,4.764755480607082,1186.0,0.5210227097491011,0.3616742515005802,1.0321476471780802,1.081314565588723,-0.3201180325423073,1.1181926950857208,0.0008431703204047,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0013490195482874,-0.9166,0.107,0.107,0.786,Negative,Very Strong

No Author,clemson university students welcome ben shapiro is a pig  daily wire,"wow indictment likely in clinton foundation case hillarys server hacked by five foreign entities by november   
uhoh 
according to bret baier of fox news the fbi has been investigating the clinton foundation for over a year and that investigation has been deep and wide  and just as importantly the fbi is on the verge of indictment for payforplay with regard to hillarys state department the fbi investigation has uncovered laptops from clinton top aides and the material on those laptops is being analyzed 
and most importantly of all  the sources at the fbi have apparently told baier with  percent accuracy that hillarys server was hacked at least five foreign intelligence agencies and information was withdrawn 
meanwhile we now know that the department of justice attempted to pressure the fbi into shutting down the investigation into the clinton foundation entirely according to the wall street journal  the fbi deputy director even asked the doj if they truly wanted to shut down a validly predicated investigation 
this is devastating information for hillary 
donald trump is now leading in florida ohio nevada iowa and north carolina trump is within spitting distance in colorado and pennsylvania and two new polls show trump up in virginia and new hampshire respectively if trump picks off any of those latter states he wins the election 
the best case scenario for hillary clinton just days ago was simple hunker down and wait out these scandals assume that as time goes on the race will revert back to its precomey normal with hillary hovering between a two and four percent lead but each new day brings a new revelation about her corruption and the corruption of the clinton foundation and state department each new day demonstrates the extent of the coverup by the obama administration 
hillarys running out of days to recover

Anonymous,no title,link hey people i always enjoy your threads though i think you focus too much on a singular belief issue or pattern and then it becomes self affirming for you in your research first this but voices actual voices in your head is always mental illness sorry maybe a stress reaction not to be judgmental happens to the best and such just really not what i am trying to convey here though i believe you are quite intelligent i dont think you are qualified exactly to make that wholesale definitive judgement you even contradict that by referencing dr vinods channeling of the nine in  channeling by definition from dictionarycom means in one sense the practice of professedly entering a meditative or trancelike state in order to convey messages from a spiritual guide surely this process would involve the sensory structure of hearing i dont wish to debate voice to skull tech with you because i dont sense this is really what your thread is about but there have been lawsuits waged and won over such technology being used to harass people who dont test as schizophrenic or any other dsm related diagnosis that would explain auditory hallucinations indicating mental illness now thats not to say that anyone hearing voices is being technologically harassed but saying definitively its always mental illness does a disservice to the search for knowledge and stopping such technology being used on people link to lawsuit psychotronic weaponsspace preservation acthouse resolution bill brain manipulation from a distance last year in october the congressman dennis j kucinich introduced in the american congress a bill obliging the american president to get engaged in the negotiations aimed at the ban of space based weapons in this bill the definition of a weapon system includes any other unacknowledged or as yet undeveloped means inflicting death or injury on or damaging or destroying a person or the biological life bodily health mental health or physical and economic wellbeing of a person through the use of landbased seabased or spacebased systems using radiation electromagnetic psychotronic sonic laser or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations or the purpose of information war mood management or mind control of such persons or populations  as in all legislative acts quoted in this article the bill counts with sound light or electromagnetic stimulation of human brain psychotronic weapons remain at least for a layman uninformed of secret military research in the sphere of science fiction since so far none of the published scientific experiments was presented in the way which would allow for its replication that it is feasible to manipulate human behavior with the use of subliminal either sound or visual messages is now generally known this is why in most of the countries the use of such technologies without consent of the user is banned devices using light for the stimulation of the brain show another way how the light flashing in certain frequencies could be used for the manipulation of human psychic life as for the sound a report on the device transmitting a beam of sound waves which can hear only persons at whom the beam of sound waves is targeted appeared last year in the world newspapers the beam is formed by a combination of sound and ultrasound waves which causes that a person targeted by this beam hears the sound inside of his head such a perception could easily convince the human being that it is mentally ill the acts presented in this article suggest that with the development of technology and knowledge of the functioning of human brain new ways of manipulation of human mind keep emerging one of them seems to be the electromagnetic energy though in the open scientific literature only some  experiments were published supporting this assumption  already in  in the ussr after successful testing with military unit in novosibirsk the installation radioson radiosleep was registered with the government committee on the matters of inventions and discoveries of the ussr described as a method of induction of sleep by means of radio waves     dear senatorattorney letter included we seek your offices assistance in initiating hearings and a factfinding congressional inquiry into the government agencies andor private companies that are targeting citizens many citizens are desperate to be freed from the disturbing intrusive and oppressive targeting evidence supports the conclusion that weapons exist that could be used against individuals based on us patent and trademark office filings public releases by agencies and other technologies that indicate the level of technological sophistication the weapons are believed to be based on electromagnetism microwaves sonic waves lasers and other types of directed energy and were characterized as psychotronic in rep dennis kucinichs draft of house resolution  the space preservation act of  furthermore it is undeniable that government agencies have tested citizens without permission in the past for example the cias human experimentation discussed in orlikow v us  fsupp  ddc  secretly administered lysergic acid diethylamide discussed in united states v stanley  us   and military chemical experimentation as discussed in congressional committee report  d congress d session s prt  dec   lastly the sheer numbers of people complaining of being targeted including people with postgraduate degrees and a lifetime of achievements and the similarities in symptoms tend to outweigh a dismissive response based on charges of anecdotal evidence or group paranoia there is a certain risk of sounding too conspiratorial however common denominators such as physical symptoms and medical reports surveillance scenarios harassment techniques and more can be readily established i highly recommend reading in full the details of this lawsuit containing a great deal of verifiable information the military has admitted for some time to having at the least a non lethal lol weapon called active denial but this rabbit hole goes much much deeper having said all that as ive said before in one of your threads i think it wise to consider that its not just one thing or another its many things there could be aliens for instance and then there could be milabs leaving the person with the memory of an alien abduction rather than their being used for human experimentation which is supposed to be against our constitution and most certainly against our human rights and then people can also suffer from temporal lobe seizure like hallucinations but one must also remember that these can most certainly be induced artificially as well in short i think your rabbit hole is only making it to the gopher level

Sean Colarossi,trumps new defense strategy on access hollywood tape blame the microphone,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on mon oct st  at  am in donald trump you have a candidate who is frequently saying  false things in a day up to  on some days share on twitter print this post 
cnns brian stelter calls donald trump a uniquely factchallenged candidate which is a prelude to introducing daniel dale washington correspondent for the toronto star  who fact checks every single word trump utters and tallies them up for his paper  
dale says most factcheckers look at two or three things trump says meticulously factchecks them and posts an article but that doesnt work when you have a candidate who is frequently saying  false things in a day up to  on some days 
for example dale tallied  trump lies on tuesday october  donald trump said  false things yesterday trumpcheck pictwittercomewfyfedfx 
 daniel dale ddale october   
which as dale pointed out  followed his recordtying  false claims on monday not coincidentally a day on which trump called fact checkers scum 
watch courtesy of cnns reliable sources there is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty ddale says trump lies a lot more than clinton httpstcokpkvpntmo 
 reliable sources reliablesources october   
the mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between trump and clinton as dale told stelter there is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty trump says dale is not a normal political liar 
for example look at the presidential debates  in which dale found  trump false statements as opposed to  by clinton 
dales judgment is that there is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent 
trump also lies pointlessly argues dale explaining to brian stelter that 
he gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases it is not clear whether hes lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts 
this was mark cubans complaint of course that trump has no interest in learning 
in the end it matters less why trump lies than that he does especially since he is busily convincing his base that hillary clinton is the dishonest candidate and it is working this is a trope frequently repeated by trumps supporters you can correct them as often as you want it will have no effect 
the lie has taken hold  one of many  many more than you likely expected and observational bias takes care of the rest the trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality and as dale tweeted last night 
if trump loses the smart republican excavation is going to have to involve some long hard base reeducation 
given the gops history with facts good luck with that

admin,liberal cnn commentator blames republicans for obamacares rising premiums,"it wasnt long ago that the left represented the antiestablishment wing in politics they used to fight against globalism remember the antiglobalization movement even if their motives were different from those of todays antiglobalists as well as being against censorship imperialist wars and the expanding powers of governments and corporations but today you see leftists protesting against brexit attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment using twitter on their apple products while sipping on their starbucks coffee and are calling for war in syria to challenge the russians so just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elites

to understand we must go back to  when the occupy movement was ongoing the occupy protests which now seem like ages ago came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system we can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them but the important fact is that to the elites it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their power
the elites were in a panic as this was the first time in postwar history that the people of west mobilized in mass to threaten their rule so the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a fullblown revolution and they already had a plan in mind the never antiquated strategy of divide and rule
the diversion 
when the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed the pressure will mount and it wont go anywhere the people want to vent out their frustrations the elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up so instead of fighting it they prefer to rechannel that pent up energy elsewhere
on february  with the occupy movement still raging the elites were given that golden opportunityor rather they created onewhen a black teenager was shot dead in florida the none other than the infamous trayvon martin case the shooter wasnt even a full white but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it anything to divert the public attention away from them with their efforts it quickly became the biggest story of america
but they didnt stop there police shootings which have always been happening and to all races were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of black lives matter movementa movement that is financed by george soros and others to stir up unrests across america
did the elites convert occupy protesters into sjw patsies
the diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the  who were dictating their lives the occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere although i dont have as much proof as with the rise of blm movement i strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established order
the strategy 
back in th century karl marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism if we were to apply this concept to the world today the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elites
the goal the elites is simple divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power meanwhile they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans the worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possible
my understanding of their modus operandi is this  use hotbutton issues to stir up controversy something that doesnt affect them like gay marriage race issues and all other politically correct nonsense  have the leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the right  let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each others throats  when the issue fades away foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process by cycling through them over and over again the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against them
thus we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites women against men islam and atheism against christianity left against right and so on but no more antiglobalization tea party movement or occupy wall street
as long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists sexists and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government nothing will change as long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant and getting in the way of creating a decent society the people will remain divided as long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals the latest misogynist outrage or how a lion named cecil got shot the elites will continue to win
a couple more points to consider i know they look like an occupying army but theres nothing to be alarmed about theyre just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the terrorists
first while this article has been focused on how the left has been toyed by the globalist elites lets not forget that the right are not totally immune to their influence either remember how neocons  globalists puppets disguised as conservatives  effectively lured the conservatives in america through faith and patriotism the support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against iraq based on bullshit evidences of wmds and saddamalqueda link while the right has changed a lot since then there are still conservatives today who are itching for a war with russia because usa usa usa 
second it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule it is not the end of it the elites have far more sinister aims by raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism the elites are preparing for a total social control i get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social control
no matter their differences when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder theyll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the us government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens  a leaked soros memo also reveals that the blm movement is potentially being used to federalize the us police  while many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near future
the culture wars necessary fight or engineered distraction 
the issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elites
on one hand we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists zionists  bankers megacorporations  and the governments from undermining our existence really do the issues of politicallyincorrect halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middleclass is being destroyed revelations of massive corruption in the dnc the coming policestate and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world all the drama of outrage and counteroutrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shape
on the other hand culture does matter in many ways uncontrolled immigration antimale laws and censorship are all very relevant issues and as much of the leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment the situation isnt exactly the divide and rule model i described above in a way we are now forced to fight the left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elites
so does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us or should we continue playing the elites games and bicker with their sjw drones i dont have a good answer but whatever we choose to do i believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on we should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankind
conclusion is there still hope 
although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization the current us election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment to me that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling class
with bernie sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps the only antiestablishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by donald trump this is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down trump and use disgruntled leftists against his supporters
i have my doubts about trump  but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that hillary clinton will bring to america and the world if she gets elected but besides voting i believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us we cant constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destiny

No Author,insider leaks bills word nickname for hillary exposes dirty bad habits,"email 

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election 
reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi 
apparently hillary is not the only person in washington who has made plans to escape justice under a trump administration john kerry has quietly been selling his property in the us for millions of dollars of late with an announcement of the sale of his  million dollar nantucket mansion in june  as well as the sale of his yacht for  million in july  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january  another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true

machado added its clear its really clear that he does not respect women he just judges us on our looks 
it is smart to take every opportunity to remind voters that as a human being donald trump has consistently behaved in public like trash he is a man who hates women and treats more than half of the population like objects 
having machado introduce clinton in florida was also savvy politics trump has never demonstrated the personal restraint needed not to take the bait machados comments should cause trump to blow up again and throw his dire campaign even further off message

reldra,two powerful quakes hit italy within hours,link years ago i came here for the ufos and after a small amount of time i stopped believing mostly due to nothing being real anymore most stuff is faked at least in my opinion the below is true even if its not as exciting as cgi videos my main reason for posting is about one of the very few times i saw stuff back in summer of july i went on a camping trip to possum kingdom lake in west texas with a friend robert my last trip as a single guy before i got married the following month the trip was a lot of canoeing swimming cliff diving snorkeling and camping out at night beneath the stars no tent just star gazing while we eventually drifted off to sleep nightly robert and i were best friends and also worked together too anyway one really really dark chilly and moonless night about pm or so we had tucked ourselves in our sleeping bags and had a really good spot elevated with no distractions to look at the night sky i had excellent vision then and could see pretty danged good i was  my friend was  he partook of the herb and drank beer daily and i consumed a few beers daily by nightfall we were tuckered out and wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep the heat of the west texas day really took it out of us the campsite was only accessed by boat we used a rental canoe so we paddled our way to this place that was a fairly large and very rugged rocky peninsula with some cliffs being  foot high they seemed a lot taller to me we camped on the top of the cliffs at night and played down on the water by day so this one night i was looking at a particular spot up there above us and he was looking at another i then saw it and said look right there he having binoculars he looked at where i had pointed saw it and got pretty excited he finally let me look at it through his binoculars and what i saw was the following slightly larger than what we normally see a satellite was a transparent or semitransparent and faint bluish looking sphere a clear bubble really moving at a speed i remember as being slightly faster than what a satellite would be going but not so much faster or slower than any planejet traffic would be in my estimation it was going south and we watched it by passing the binoculars back and forth we both assumed it was a satellite exciting stuff but then one of us i really cant remember who noticed another one this time coming from the east they appeared to be on a course that appeared to us that would be really a close call if they were at the same altitude when they were getting a little too close for comfort at least for us the one that came from the east shot a light bluish light at the southbound sphere it wasnt laserlike at all i dont think but it appeared more like a vshaped beam from a flashlight shot at it it lasted all of a second and i am positive that it happened due to we both saw it at the same time the light flash made the southbound one turn westward now going almost the same direction as the one from the east making them both going in the same direction actually the one that got flashed didnt make a  degree turn it was really going more of a path more like westsouthwest more like  degrees or so just guessing now when i say that it turned it turned abruptly not at all anything like any plane would do that struck us both as being odd no curving involved at all we watched them until they both grew dim from the distance both staying in a straight line to their intended destination of course we kept thinking that the one that flashed the beam would turn and follow the other but nope i could be wrong on the speed and the directions but the rest is completely accurate the really sharp turn back then was unheard of we hear it all of the time now years ago though it wasnt talked about at all not even in the tabloids this is why this really stood out out to me all of these years that almost  degree turn to be honest i just didnt understand what we had just seen we finally got to sleep that night i dont know how long it took us but we did but after a few hours around ish am robert woke me up and said listen and i heard footsteps that scared us pretty good cause we had gotten so worked up earlier i guess heheh we listened to the small branches and small gravel rocks moving beneath whatever it was that was about to kill us well we did until we finally scared ourselves to sleep i have to admit ok yeah i did partake myself but only a little bit i wasnt into it like him but i was on vacation that made us both very paranoid i guess anyway the next morning we found our bread and peanut butter missing the breads plastic wrapper was there but no bread creepy a few years later my boss who i had told all of this to and he made fun of me told me that the same thing happened to him his peanut butter and bread went missing while camped on a river they determined that it was a raccoon which they do this sort of thing i know now now to regular people that might not seem like much especially now days here on this forum more spectacular claims are made daily still for back then it was really something my older brother by  years and i were camping with no tent underneath the starry sky of caddo lake in east texas around  in the spring may i think and we were looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees actually talking about when we were kids looking for flying saucers thats all they were known as back then our entire family would look out at the sky in our backyard it was a common thing for us to do back in the fifties after all that was its heyday as we stared at the sky in the back of my pickup i mentioned the bluish sphere that i had seen years before at possum kingdom lake he being quiet through the entire story he wasnt that talkative really and within  minutes of me mentioning this to him we saw one i had my own binoculars this time i was really amazed it was exactly as what i had seen before i mean exactly nothing major happened though it just quietly slid across the sky in front of us and disappeared behind the trees to our right and that was that my brother was never a believer anyway maybe had it landed it would change his mind we saw several regular ol satellites afterwards too why i even bring this up is that when i first started coming here around  lurking i read a thread of a guy here that saw the exact thing i did with the slightly vshaped flashlight looking beam and the other blue sphere turning away id really love to read that again it was a good feeling to be somewhat confirmed i say confirmed because that friend robert that witnessed the sphere denied it in front of a lot of people at work we hardly talked about anything else on that trip and especially on the way home too assuming he felt as i did i brought it up when a bunch of guys were taking a break at work maybe  people i didnt see the harm in telling what we saw after i said my piece i said ask robert robert said i was crazy and he didnt see a thing i thought he was kidding but he was being serious youd think that on the way back hed say that he wasnt wanting to tell anyone but nooo edit on  by

on friday the fbi announced an investigation into newly leaked emails linked to hillary clinton in a surprising twist the new leaked emails from the private email server were discovered after the fbi confiscated electronic devices belonging to top aide huma abedin her controversial and perverted husband anthony weiner 
officially the federal law enforcement agents are opening an investigation into weiner texting a yearold in north carolina and according to director comey the fbi were taking steps to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation 
shortly after the announcement donald trump utilized the situation to advantage and running theme of clintons corruption at a rally in new hampshire supporters nearly cheered in complete unison lock her up 
hillary clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office said trump to the roaring crowd 
i have great respect for the fact that the fbi and the doj are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made mr trump said referring also to the department of justice this was a grave miscarriage of justice that the american people fully understand it is everybodys hope that it is about to be corrected 
the fbis decision to reopen their criminal investigation into hillary clintons secret email server just  days before the election shows how serious this discovery must be reince priebus the republican committee chairman said in a statement this stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why and whether they show intent to violate the law

starring burgess jenkins of remember the titans and nashville and gregory alan williams of miracles from heaven this awardwinning movie brings the love of baseball to hearth and home it also features a powerful music soundtrack by threetime grammy winner michael omartian 
get every boy needs a hero now at the wnd superstore from the producers of alone yet not alone the movie is a powerful tale of restoring and strengthening relationships between fathers and their children 
according to dr ted baehr founder of movieguide  hero is an excellent movie about god turning a mans heart to his son and a son learning to forgive his father 
dr baehr added the opening is powerful the ending is heartrending the drama the acting the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie this is one of the few movies that movieguide can actually say go see it keith harris and nick edwards as wynn and sammy heller 
hero opens with joe played by burgess jenkins coaching his son davids baseball team the gappers to the state championship seven years later after pursuing his dream job joe returns to town he had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family his wife hannah is stricken with cancer while david is angry that joe left them after hannahs funeral joe moves back into the house but david remains bitter meanwhile david is coaching the now hapless gappers the team loses more than it wins joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners hoping this gesture will help joe reconcile with david unfortunately the league rules have softened dramatically making it nearly impossible to train the team properly practice times are limited coaches cant make players take laps around the field everyone gets a participation trophy the beloved american pastime has become so boring that few parents show up for games let alone practices so joe starts his own league to turns things around 
from the director of isaiah  judgment and the producer of alone not yet alone comes hero a beautiful tale of the significance of the fatherchild relationship thats and set around americas pastime baseball 
one of the fathers joe pursues for the new league is the warden of the local prison mr redding played by gregory alan williams reddings career mirrors that of joe hes been offered a big job in washington dc like joe hes lured by fame and fortune at the expense of his relationship with his son and family in contrast another gapper teammate has a father whos actually a prison inmate under redding unlike many of the absent fathers outside the prison walls the inmate father has a great desire to practice baseball with his son but he cannot due to prison rules justin miles and burgess jenkins as david and joe finn in the film every boy needs a hero 
what makes hero particularly compelling today is that it addresses the growing crisis of absentee fathers and its impact on baseball itself 
watch the trailer 
washington times reporter bradford richardson wrote in his article study blames absent fathers for decline in black baseball players that the austin institute a texasbased think tank focused on family and societal issues has commissioned a study titled called out at home which shows a correlation between the decline of black fatherhood and the drop in black participation in baseball 
from the director of isaiah  judgment and the producer of alone not yet alone comes hero a beautiful tale of the significance of the fatherchild relationship thats and set around americas pastime baseball 
richardson writes 
kevin stuart executive director of the austin institute said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because it takes two to play catch 
there is a longstanding connection between fatherhood and baseball mr stuart said pointing to famous fatherson tandems who have played in the major leagues and the prominence of fatherson relationships in popular baseball movies such as field of dreams 
baseball he said was made to be played by fathers and sons 
baseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle where whats really necessary or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you mr stuart said 
anecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the studys connection between fatherhood and baseball 
famous fatherson tandems  including ken griffey sr and ken griffey jr prince fielder and cecil fielder and tony gwynn sr and tony gwynn jr  have talked about how the game was handed down from one generation to the next

Prissy Holly,leaked hillary would completely ban the most popular guns in america,"surgeons admit that mammography is outdated and harmful to women 
friday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags breast cancer  mammography  harming women naturalnews every year millions of women flock to their doctors to get their annual mammograms a breast cancer screening procedure that involves pressing a womans breasts between two metal platforms to scope out tumors but surgeons everywhere are starting to question the controversial practice  which studies show isnt even an effective screening tool and is actually harmful to the bodies of women who receive itthe public is told that mammograms are the only way to catch breast cancer early but a review of eight scientific trials evaluating the procedure found that mammography is neither effective nor safe after looking at data on more than  women between the ages of  and  who underwent the procedure on a routine basis researchers found that many women are misdiagnosed many of these same women are consequently mistreated with chemotherapy  resulting in their rapid demiseas published in the cochrane database of systematic reviews  the review concluded that mammography causes more harm than good  because many more women end up being misdiagnosed and mistreated than those actually avoiding the development of terminal breast cancer thus the procedure known as mammography is an outdated scourge that belongs in the history books of failed medical treatments and not at the forefront of womens medicineif we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by  and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at  it means that for every  women invited for screening throughout  years one will avoid dying of breast cancer and  healthy women  who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening will be treated unnecessarily the authors concluded group of top medical experts admits mammography does more harm than good one year after this review was published a second one published in the new england journal of medicine nejm came to a similar conclusion a team of medical professionals that included a medical ethicist a clinical epidemiologist a pharmacologist an oncologic surgeon a nurse scientist a lawyer and a health economist decided that the medical industrys claims about the benefits of mammography are essentially bunkthey found that for every  women screened in the us over a year annual screening period beginning at age  one breast cancer death would be prevented while a shocking  to  women would have a false positive while  to  would undergo an unnecessary biopsy between three and  of these women the study found would also be overdiagnosed for a nonmalignant form of cancer that never even would have become clinically apparentthis study out of switzerland corroborates another out of canada  the  canadian national breast screening study  which concluded in lockstep with the others that mammography screenings do not reduce mortality rates from breast cancer any better than a simple physical examination in other words the procedure is completely unnecessary and in many cases exceptionally harmful and on and on the list goes with data out of norway and elsewhere confirming that mammography isnt all that its cracked up to be us data spanning the course of nearly  years shows that more women are over or misdiagnosed with breast cancer because of mammograms than are successfully earlydiagnosed with breast cancer in such a way as to protect against metastasization this represents an exceptionally poor track record that calls into question why mammography continues to be used when it clearly doesnt worki believe that if you did have a tumor the last thing you would want to do is crush that tumor between two plates because that would spread it says general practitioner dr sarah mybill as quoted in the documentary film the promise  sources for this article include",naturalnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,2.2264292892673696,68,11,3883,618,5.236245954692556,618.0,0.1846972769751917,0.1737735362073249,0.2392263536316995,0.1908718768324852,0.1451968260019046,0.2069318055627602,0.0016181229773462,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0024434894022549,-0.9975,0.069,0.159,0.772,Negative,Very Strong

Lloyd Billingsley,hillarymediamolecon,"the hostility and hypocrisy of leftwing israeli ngos where are the condemnations of the pas efforts to prevent normalization with israel november   
originally written for the investigative project on terrorism 
israeli human rights group btselem recently appeared before a special session of the united nations security council excoriating israel and pleading with the body to act against israels settlements 
in  the un famously declared that zionism is racism and four decades later the organization continues to hound israel in each of the last four years as the syrian bloodbath claimed hundreds of thousands of lives there were at least five times as many resolutions condemning israel as those rebuking the rest of the world 
the uns cultural body unesco recently passed a motion ignoring any jewish or christian historical ties to east jerusalem holy sites referring to the temple mount and western wall only by their muslim names and condemning israel as the occupying power it turns out that some of israels leftwing ngos worked to help produce the unesco motion 
given the uns chronic hostility efforts by israeli ngos to persuade the un to act against israel are arguably treasonous indeed one attorney and activist for israels leftleaning labor party filed a police complaint alleging treason against btselem arguing that the ngo has harmed state sovereignty tried to give land away to a foreign entity and taken steps that could cause a war 
israeli democracy is extremely tolerant to the point of allowing its members of parliament to openly support terrorism and terrorist groups last march several israeli arab knesset members condemned arab states for labeling hizballah a terrorist organization even though it has been at war with israel for decades and regularly threatens new hostilities 
last february members from the joint arab list paid a solidarity visit to relatives of palestinian terrorists whom israeli security forces had killed to stop them from murdering israelis in  mk hanin zoabi balad drew praise from hamas after she asserted that the kidnappers of three missing israeli youths were not terrorists hamass connection to the young mens abduction and murder helped to spark the third war between israel and hamas in gaza 
thus israel already has plenty of dissenting voices and activists without foreign intervention nevertheless foreign interests have identified israeli ngos as the soft underbelly of israeli democracy and have leveraged them to promote their own agendas the problem became so acute that a watchdog ngo monitor was formed in  to track the selfhostility being funded largely by european and other foreign sources as the organization notes ngos lack a system of checks and balances andprovide accountability to their funders and activist members and not to the citizens or societies whose lives are directly impacted by their activities 
ngo monitor also notes that even though most of the foreign government funding for these israeli ngos is formally designated for educating the israeli public and changing public opinion both in violation of the norms on noninterference in other democracies these israeli ngos are very active externally in the delegitmization and political warfare against israel 
these leftwing israeli ngos receive money from about two dozen foreign governments  and some private organizations  that includes millions of dollars from billionaire george soros 
in catch the jew  author tuvia tenenbom exposed how foreignfunded human rights and cultural organizations in israel tend to serve as vehicles for attacking israel by presenting himself to interview subjects as tobi the german tenenbom elicits some surprising confessions for example the new fund for cinema and tv a foreignfunded israeli cultural ngo told him that that about  percent of political documentaries made in israel are coproduced by europeans that includes a documentary called what makes a hero which equates israels military with the nazis such films would be too scandalous to be produced in germany but germansponsored ngos can safely pay leftwing israelis to make such movies 
some foreign funders of israeli ngos have even unwittingly enriched hamas last august hamas allegedly siphoned off tens of millions of dollars from world vision a usbased charity and used the funds for weapons purchases tunnel construction and other military activities 
the knesset passed a law in july requiring disclosure of foreign funding sources for ngos that get more than half of their money from overseas the law is clearly aligned with the american foreign agents registration act fara wrote legal scholar eugene kontorovich who defended the legislation in response to critics 
israel is unique in the sheer scale of the foreign government sponsorship of domestic political groups he wrote for example the european union alone has in recent years given roughly  million euro a year for political ngos in the us and roughly an order of magnitude more in israela vastly larger per capita amount 
the obama administration opposes foreign influence only when that influence promotes a dissenting view obama opposed netanyahus speech to the us congress against the iranian nuclear deal but was happy to give a speech to the uk parliament against brexit the obama administration critiqued israels ngofundingdisclosure law  perhaps because it had sent us taxpayer money to an israeli ngo working to oust israels prime minister 
the same hypocrisy seems to prevail among israels foreignfunded ngos they ostensibly exist to promote democracy and peaceful coexistence but are conspicuously silent when palestinian institutions violate those ideals such silence enables abuse by palestinians and promotes a distorted and incomplete picture of the complex reality in which israelis operate foreignfunded israeli ngos remained silent after the palestinian authority arrested palestinians who visited a sukkah in a symbolic peace event promoting coexistence 
these organizations are silent when the palestinian leadership pays salaries to the families of terrorists glorifies murderers and calls streets and city centers after them netanyahu said these organizations prove again and again that they are not actually interested in human rights but only in shaming israel and libeling it around the world 
if israels leftwing ngos truly are committed to democracy and peace why havent they condemned the pas efforts to prevent normalization with israel in  jibril rajoub the deputy secretary of the fatah central committee and the head of the palestinian supreme council for sport and youth affairs condemned a coexistencepromoting soccer match between israeli and palestinian youths on a southern kibbutz as a crime against humanity 
last week a palestinian newspaper came under intense criticism for publishing an interview with israeli defense minister avigdor liberman the jerusalembased newspaper alquds was denounced by hamas  the palestinian journalists syndicate and the supposedly moderate pa the chilling effects and antipeace message implicit in the harsh reactions to the interview have yet to catch the attention of any leftwing ngos supposedly working for peace and democracy",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,84.45285857853474,19,1,7212,1114,5.446140035906643,1114.0,-1.313479650835859,-1.705233616725228,1.1199854414581598,0.9684415487041296,0.3523416997108364,1.0026807513433738,0.0017953321364452,0.0,0.0008976660682226,0,0,0.0,0.0029450978662546,-0.9858,0.085,0.113,0.802,Negative,Very Strong

another equally horrifying scenario would have occurred he added had the device exploded whilst the spectators were exiting the stadium

Sarah Jones,number of accusers grows to  as former miss finland accuses trump of sexual assault,"by robert franek on sun oct th  at  am imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as hillary clintons emails this is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety security and wellbeing share on twitter print this post 
the following post written by the rev robert a franek is a part of politicus policy discussion in which writers draw connections between real lives and public policy 
even after months and months of coverage blown out of proportion and at great expense to the public in dollars psychic stress and issue coverage it seems all one has to do is put hillary clinton and emails together in the same sentence with claims of lying and threatening national security and pandemonium continues to break loose throughout the mass media and social media worlds and yet despite multiple investigations and repeated explanations the pandemonium persists so much so that every time republicans stir up some smoke the media assumes there must be a blazing fire and sadly this is not going away anytime soon as republicans are promising more sham investigations in lieu of actually governing as sarah jones reported 
republicans are already planning how to avoid being grown ups who do their jobs if hillary clinton is elected president yes there will be more toythrowing and tantrums and best of all for the party of fiscal humiliations more wasteful spending on political witch hunts  sarah jones 
meanwhile women continue to come forward with painful heartbreaking stories of donald trumps sexual harassment and assault yet instead of being portrayed as survivors who have finally had enough of the republican presidential nominee and his lies and as women who have the strength and courage to go public with their stories they are being made into opportunistic victims and challenged for not coming forward sooner much sooner woefully no mention is made of the many intersecting reasons that lead many women and men not to report these crimes including that this is the only time when the victim is placed on trial 
after walking her readers through one incident of donald trumps public sexual humiliation of a woman for revenge  sarah jones makes the following observation 
if there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the trump candidacy perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all trumps fault its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman 
she is right donald trump is despicable still there is cultural culpability in the perpetuation of rape culture where women are treated as objects forced into silence and placed on trial for their assailants crimes 
this must change 
it is unacceptable in a country that places such a high value on freedom that so many are not free from sexual harassment assault exploitation and humiliation more it is appalling that such behavior is often cheered unchallenged and dismissed it is also inexcusable that survivors face unparalleled levels of scrutiny when they do finally come forward 
it is also beyond tragic that people of faith who read the first chapter of genesis cant bear out the implications of men and women being created simultaneously and bearing equally the divine image 
supposed christian values champion and republican vice presidential nominee mike pence is more upset over an article he didnt read regarding voter suppression efforts by the trump campaign than any of the horrifying things donald trump has said including bragging about sexual assault 
these are not christian values nor are they values any civil society should hold failing to call out donald trumps abhorrent behavior and speech is beyond deplorable additionally supporting candidates like donald trump and mike pence gives validity to their wretched views and is especially shocking when done by people of faith and family values 
as a society we must challenge the pervasive and systemic sexism and misogyny that persists in our culture as much as we need changes in our laws and lawmakers at every level of government to reflect the equality and humanity of women we need a moral revival in our collective conscience as a nation that decries every facet of rape culture from how we raise our children to the victim blaming and shaming that happens each time a survivor goes public with their story 
imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as hillary clintons emails this is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety security and wellbeing

The Alex Jones Show,trump votes are being flipped to clinton,"big pharma targets profits in rare diseases all of the worlds most expensive drugs are used to treat uncommon conditions image credits stocksnappixabay  
one might think big pharma garners most of its profit peddling pills for more wellknown diseases but new research shows that pharmaceutical companies are instead searching for the next big thing in rare diseases 
big pharmas profit margins continue to rise considerably with rarer diseases simply because they can charge more for the pills than they do for medication for more common ailments 
the search for the next moneymaker within rare diseases has actually halted some of the advancements for more common ailments which may explain why they still havent discovered a cure for some of the most common diseases affecting the worlds population 
in  the orphan drug act started to incentivize the creation of drugs for rarer diseases to ensure that those suffering from uncommon conditions were not neglected in new scientific research simply because the drugs werent as profitable 
because of the incentives which include reduced taxes and reduced or waived regulatory fees over  new drugs for uncommon diseases have hit the market since the law was introduced 
for common illnesses big pharma can get still turnover big profits while not charging a fortune for the drug for example liptior atorvastatin which is used to regulate cholesterol generates a sales profit of  billion with the prescription only costing patients around  per day 
but with rare diseases prices must be kept high in order to keep big pharma in business this means that while those with uncommon illnesses may benefit healthwise from the new measures their pocketbooks are in for a hit 
for example the cystic fibrosis drug kalydeco by vertex costs individual patients  
gileads sovaldi used to treat hepatitis c cashes in at  for a paltry week course of medication 
and soliris used to treat rare blood conditions costs the patient a whopping  per year 
the list of the  most expensive drugs that are currently manufactured are all created to treat orphan or uncommon illnesses 
thanks to these laws that allow big pharma to charge these insane amounts of money they can use those who suffer from rare diseases as their cash cows

No Author,life when this middle school introduced meditation into the school day many of its students saw incredible benefits and three went insane,"ever wonder how britains most iconic pop pianist gets through a long flight here are the six pictures of sharks sir elton john likes to stare at to pass the time on an airplane  a shark swimming 
sit next to elton john on a flight and youll see a man living in the lap of luxury as he immediately tapes this photo of a shark darting through the ocean over his window to stare at throughout the trip the platinumselling artist has been known to pull his window shade down to make the shark disappear and then quickly retract it to mark the animals triumphant return he will often repeat this act dozens of times per flight  a great white shark leaping into the air 
when youre an international pop sensation worth an estimated  million people go the extra mile to make you happy flight crews are instructed to place this photo of a breaching great white in elton johns seatback pocket before he even boards the plane the fivetime grammy winner loves to pull the image out at his leisure to stare at while flying sometimes holding it a mere to inches away from his face while he fixates upon the sharks beady eyes  a shark on the prowl 
rumor has it elton john first acquired this shark photo in  just before flying to london to perform candle in the wind at princess dianas funeral its been a staple of his travel routine ever since those who have flown with the music legend say that sir elton turns on every single overhead light in his row to study this picture with a magnifying glass  two hammerhead sharks 
how does the man behind tiny dancer and rocket man handle turbulence as his plane traverses the atlantic once that fasten seat belts sign lights up this picture of two hammerhead sharks comes out elton john holds the photo in a tight vice grip and stares straight at it until the turbulence passes often without blinking for minutes at a time  the poster for jaws 
sir elton john absolutely adores the poster for steven spielbergs jaws and hopes to one day see the film in the meantime the british icon makes do by slowly unfolding his byinch copy of the poster whenever hes on a long flight gently tracing the sharks teeth with his finger as he stares lovingly into its gaping mouth  pilots choice 
as much as elton relishes in the calming regularity of his shark picture rotation he also loves the excitement of gazing upon a totally unexpected shark when flying from london to a distant corner of europe thats why all pilots who fly sir elton print out a shark picture of their choice from their home computers before going to the airport and hand it to the visibly excited musician prior to takeoff so yeahits good to be elton",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,137,22,2642,481,4.465696465696466,481.0,2.294374991647896,2.240681404433133,-0.0891070882405254,-0.0239003914062551,-0.6152599513465415,-0.0128617540580946,0.0062370062370062,0.0,0.002079002079002,0,0,0.0385969179086185,0.0099603232299402,0.9952,0.119,0.009,0.872,Positive,Very Strong

Amy Goodrich,clear heart blockages with this powerful lemon and garlic mixture,"thu oct th  at  pm just another day in the life of donald trumps presidential campaign share on twitter print this post 
it was a standard day in the life of donald trumps presidential campaign as the republican nominee spent much of his time on the campaign trail thursday making outrageous and insulting comments 
this was on clear display at a rally in toledo ohio when trump proposed one of his most ridiculous ideas yet cancel the election and just anoint him president 
video trump jokes we should just cancel the election and just give it to trump right what are we even having it for her policies are so bad pictwittercomstzidbpf 
 bradd jaffy braddjaffy october   
im just thinking to myself right now we should just cancel the election and just give it to trump right trump asked the crowd what are we even having it for  her policies are so bad 
despite trumps plea to cancel the election as he continues to struggle in the polls it will be the voters who decide which candidate has the better policies  thankfully 
the remark also aligns closely with other recent comments in which trump claimed the process is rigged against him and he will only accept the outcome of the election if its favorable for him 
but trump wasnt done at his buckeye state rally he also made sure to take a dig at minority communities 
video help me out there did trump just say were going to work on our ghettos before mentioning inner cities violence and african americans pictwittercomvkqzslbh 
 bradd jaffy braddjaffy october   
trumps comments 
were gonna work on our ghettos  take a look at whats going on where you have pockets of areas of land where you have the inner cities and you have so many things so many problems so many horrible horrible problems  the violence the death the lack of education no jobs were gonna work with the africanamerican community and were going to solve the problem of the inner city  you cant walk out the street you buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot 
the republican nominees ghetto comment is the newest addition to what is the standard trump narrative that black communities are hellscapes this particular set of remarks comes a day after he visited north carolina for a rally and told supporters  mostly white  that he would enact a new deal for black america

an intriguing ministry of finance mof report circulating in the kremlin today says that elite western bankers were stunned a few hours ago after the bank for international settlements bis registered a  billion transfer from the clinton foundation cf to the qatar central bank qcb through the facilitationabetment of jp morgan chase  company jpmand for reasons yet to be firmly established 
according to this report the bank for international settlements is the worlds oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions the qatar central bank is the bank of that gulf state nations government and their bank of banks jp morgan chase  company is the united states largest megabank and the clinton foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the russian mafia 
with hillary clintons us presidential campaign chairman john podesta having longstanding ties to the russian mafia and money laundering this report continues the foreign intelligence service svr maintains complete surveillance of him and his criminal associatesincluding both hillary clinton and her husband and former us president bill clinton 
on saturday  october  this report notes the svr reported to the mof that hillary clinton and john podesta met with jp morgan chase  company ceo jamie dimon at clintons chappaqua compound outside of new york cityand who in  both president obama and hillary clinton allowed to break us laws by his dimons being able to buy millionsofdollars of his companys stocks prior to the public being told his jp morgan bank was receiving a federal reserve  billion credit lineand that caused jp morgans stocks to soar and that have had an astonishing  dividend growth since  
within  hours of the hillary clintonjohn podestajamie dimon meeting at the chappaqua compound this report continues the bis registered the transfer of  billion from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank 
to why the clinton foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to qatar this report explains is due to the longstanding ties between this islamic neopatrimonial absolute monarchy and then us secretary of state hillary clinton who oversaw the massive bribery scheme that allowed this gulf state nation to secure the  world cupand that the qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the clinton foundation and incredibly in  gave former us president bill clinton  million for a birthday presentbringing hillary clintons total cash grab from these persian gulf sheiks of  millionall occurring as recently released secret emails revealed hillary clintons knowledge that both qatar and saudi arabia were and still are funding isis 
to what jamie dimon said to hillary clinton that caused her to suddenly transfer  billion to qatar this report notes revolves around his jp morgan bank being told by the us federal deposit insurance corporation fdic in april  that this megabanks master plan to save itself had serious deficiencies that could pose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the united states 
two months after the fdics warning letter to jamie dimon in june  this report says he cryptically sounded a warning that the united states subprime auto loan bubble was nearing collapse and stated that someone is going to get hurt 
unbeknownst to the american people mof experts in this report explain is that just  weeks ago multiple warnings began to be issued that the united states  trillion subprime auto loan bubble was beginning to collapseand that this past week became so severe the bank of america issued a recession warning telling its elite customers that this market is scary and the britishbased multinational banking and financial services company hsbc likewise issued a red alert warning all of its clients warning them to prepare for a severe market crash 
with one of the first casualties of this subprime auto loan bubble being the german global banking giant deutsche bank that is nearing its doom and laying off tensofthousands of it workers worldwide this report grimly states the american mainstream propaganda media is failing to allow the people of that nation to know the full extent of this looming catastrophewho unlike hillary clinton who has just protected  billion of her wealth will be left defenseless once again at the hands of their elite rulers 
as wikileaks secret hillary clinton emails have now proven that the us propaganda mainstream media is now totally controlled by her and who continue their blackout on the clinton crime story of the century this report continues the absolutely horrifying statistics released this week showing that an astounding  of american who have been brutalized by the obamaclinton regime these past  years are so buried in debt they can no longer pay their bills is likewise being kept from these most innocent of peoples",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,61,9,4940,784,5.2563775510204085,784.0,-0.0293279984263869,-0.2020278943791856,0.5188786083125552,0.4511068879830759,0.1650647372587192,0.4732510091909495,0.0127551020408163,0.0,0.0076530612244897,0,0,0.0,0.0213708443501715,-0.9747,0.065,0.097,0.838,Negative,Very Strong
No Author,the left says i hate myself for voting trump while female i dont i just hate you  daily wire," things you need to know about trump attorney general pick jeff sessions by aaron bandler november   
presidentelect donald trump has announced that his selection for attorney general is sen jeff sessions ral who has long been a favorite of conservatives the democrats already have the long knives out for sessions spitballing their usual accusations of racismwhich should indicate that sessions will be an effective attorney general 
here are seven things you need to know about sessions 
 sessions has a  percent liberty score on conservative review  sessions has been in the senate for  years and has been described by the washington times as a tea partier before the tea party was cool per conservative review s biography  
 sessions has been one of the leaders in the senate in fighting against amnesty for instance sessions was among the most prominent members of the senate leading the opposition to the gang of eight bill national review  which dubbed sessions amnestys worst enemy explained how sessions would reveal true facts about the bill in an attempt to persuade some senators that hadnt decided how to vote on the legislation sessions and sen david vitter rla would find other clever ways to oppose the bill such as an amendment to a resolution honoring the late latino union organizer cesar chavez in which vitter noted chavezs opposition to illegal immigration putting sen bob menendez dnj in an awkward position 
in  sessions introduced a bill that would overhaul the immigration system according to conservative review  overturned the zadvydas v davis supreme court case that obama is using as an excuse to release criminal aliens after six months of detention explicitly deputized the states to enforce federal immigration law eliminated sanctuary cities by cutting off dhs and doj law enforcement grants expedited deportation of gang members applied the ramifications of treating illegal aliens as criminal aliens to those convicted of drunk driving clamped down on loopholes that allow legal immigrants who commit crimes to continue on the path to citizenship instead of getting deported this would address cases like the legal immigrant who murdered the family in the washington dc mansion murders 
sessions has also fought efforts to increase legal immigration as he has railed against it as the primary source of lowwage immigration into the united states 
what we need now is immigration moderation slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together sessions wrote in a  oped in the washington post  
 sessions has also spearheaded efforts to crack down on budgetary issues according to conservative review s biography of sessions 
in january  he was named ranking member of the senate budget committee in this capacity he led the republican charge against majority leader harry reid and barack obama for not offering a serious budget proposal given that the senate had not passed a budget since april  he has fought guerilla warfare often a lonely battle against democrats spending by raising budget point of orders against the breach of budget caps he has even fought his own party when his office put out devastating research against the ryanmurray budget deal sessions has also been a strong leader on welfare reform and publishing studies and data on the extent of the welfare state 
sessions has voted against the tarp bailout stimulus bills and increases to the debt limit and has traveled through his state with charts warning of the united states crippling debt per the washington post  
 sessions endorsed trump early on to the surprise of many in the establishment sessions endorsed trump in february declaring  i believe we are on a movement that must not fade away this is a campaign this is a movement the american people are not happy with their government 
it shouldnt have come as a surprise though given sessions record on immigration and that sessions tends to be more protectionist on trade 
 sessions is wellliked by his senate colleagues on a personal level according to the washington post  
say what you will about him former longtime senate democratic communications aide jim manley told the almanac of american politics he was always nice to the late ted kennedy and other democrats as well 
even people who have run against him have nice things to say about him stanleybecker talked to susan parker a democrat who tried to unseat sessions in  during a debate she asked for a tissue and sessions handed her one she joked she would use it to dry her eyes when sessions made her cry and he responded please dont say that thats my nightmare i promise ill be nice 
its no wonder then that sessions will likely be confirmed by the senate 
 accusations of racism against sessions are absurd when president ronald reagan nominated sessions who at the time was a us attorney to a federal judge the democrats smeared sessions with accusations of racism which included calling a black attorney boy quipping about the ku klux klan i used to think they were ok but they are pot smokers joking that a white attorney was a traitor to his race because he was collaborating with civil rights groups calling the naacp and aclu unamerican prosecuting a civil rights organization for voter fraud 
the last point isnt racist at all the jokes as ben shapiro has written  were made in front of the black lawyer even the lawyer accusing sessions of racism acknowledged that sessions was joking clearly sessions meant them as harmless jokes sessions has also denied calling the lawyer boy the civil rights group sessions prosecuted has faced accusations of voter fraud for many years 
sessions record on race actually shows that he has consistently fought against racism as the weekly standard s mark hemingway writes 
as a us attorney he filed several cases to desegregate schools in alabama and he also prosecuted the head of the state klan henry francis hays for abducting and killing michael donald a black teenager selected at random sessions insisted on the death penalty for hays when he was later elected the state attorney general sessions followed through and made sure the hays executed the successful prosecution of hays also led to a  million civil judgment against the klan effectively breaking the back of the kkk in alabama 
 as attorney general sessions would uphold the rule of law the reason why sessions has been such an immigration hawk is that he supports the rule of law he has also fought against judicial activist nominees and is a strong supporter of the death penalty between that and his legal background as a us attorney and alabama attorney general there is every reason to believe that sessions will follow the law and not politicize the justice department

the recent case involving a firstgeneration latina student  tiffany martínez at suffolk university is but one example an accomplished undergraduate published journal author and mcnair scholar martínez wrote a personal blog post titled academia love me back in her heartfelt plea martínez first recounts an experience she described as both disrespectful and invalidating and then explains that a sociology professor accused her of plagiarism not privately but in front of the entire class the professors claim was further illustrated by emphatic written statements on her paper such as this is not your word and please go back and indicate where you cut and paste 
one such comment was written in the margin near the word hence which the professor had circled an important detail given martínez merely used it as an appropriate transition to connect two related sentences was it that surprising to martínezs professor that she knew how to appropriately use a transitional word 
although some may dismiss this as a minor incident martínez reminds us of the internalized racism and selfdoubt resulting from years of educational violence like the many students of color from whom we hear similar stories in our campus climate assessments  what transpired for martínez was yet another debilitating and painful experience of marginalization

it is imperative that our colleagues stop being surprised when students of color are able to thoughtfully articulate themselves in their writing and in class discussions snip

well if this doesnt inspire you to do your civic duty nothing will 
when california resident candice payne woke up this morning she wasnt totally sure she was up to going through the hassle of voting she figured the lines would be long the wait would be awful and the stress probably wouldnt be worth it but just when this yearold woman was feeling too lazy to vote something absolutely amazing happenedher ovaries burst out of her body and dragged her to the polling place 
amazing now that is how you rally on election day 
like so many americans candice spent her morning lying in her bed kicking herself for not having voted early but as soon as it seemed like shed go back to sleep her fallopian tubes shot out of her abdomen curled themselves around the side of her bed and threw her to the floor after dragging her body to her living room her helpful ovaries crawled up to the doorknob and jostled the front door open what started out as a lazy morning ended with her ovaries anchoring themselves to the floor and pulling the rest of her body to a polling place at nearby jefferson public school where she dutifully filled out her ballot for president of the united states 
if thats not getting out the vote we dont know what is its definitely easy to come up with a million excuses to avoid the polls but once candices ovaries had shot out of her body they werent going to retract back inside until she had done her civic duty 
while it might have been a bit of an inconvenience to spend the morning voting no matter how much she tried to resist candices ovaries kept pulling and clawing at the floor dragging her flailing body farther and farther until she arrived at a voting booth to cast her vote sure she would rather have been sleeping or at work but three miles and several forceful tugs later she was inside a voting booth and back on her feet casting her ballot and exercising her fundamental american right

africanamericans are failing to vote at the robust levels they did four years ago in several states that could help decide the presidential election creating a vexing problem for hillary clinton as she clings to a deteriorating lead over donald j trump with election day just a week away 
snip 
the reasons for the decline appear to be both political and logistical with lower voter enthusiasm and newly enacted impediments to voting at play in north carolina where a federal appeals court accused republicans of an almost surgical assault on black turnout and republicanrun election boards curtailed earlyvoting sites black turnout is down  percent  white turnout however is up  percent democrats are planning an aggressive final push including a visit by president obama to the state on wednesday 
but in florida which extended early voting after long lines left some voters waiting for hours in  africanamericans share of the electorate that has gone to the polls in person so far has decreased  to  percent today from  percent four years ago 
the problems for democrats do not end there in ohio which also cut back its early voting voter participation in the heavily democratic areas near cleveland columbus and toledo has been down though the clinton campaign said it was encouraged by a busy day on sunday when africanamerican churches led voter drives across the state 
snip 
the clinton campaign believes it can close the gap especially in north carolina and florida by election day and democrats are seeing substantial gains in turnout for other key constituencies like hispanics and collegeeducated women which have the potential to more than make up for any dropoff in black voting

us republican presidential nominee donald trump says hillary clintons policy towards syria would lead to world war iii arguing that the democratic nominee would drag the us into an armed confrontation with russia 
trump made the warning in an interview with reuters on tuesday following clintons proposal for the establishment of a nofly zone and safe zones in syria earlier this month 
what we should do is focus on isil daesh we should not be focusing on syria trump said 
youre going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton he said 
on october  the democratic nominee said a nofly zone was required inside the warravaged country to stabilize fighting a move that was opposed in congress due to the risk of entering into conflict with russia since a usenforced nofly zone would mean the us could shoot down russian fighter jets should they enter syrian airspace 
clinton also described the situation in syria as incredibly complex since the intervention of russia us democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton speaks at an early vote rally at broward college in coconut creek florida on october   
youre not fighting syria anymore youre fighting syria russia and iran all right russia is a nuclear country but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk trump said 
the republican nominee also referred to the removal of syrian president bashar alassad from power as a secondlevel priority to defeating daesh 
assad is secondary to me to isil trump said 
russia might down us planes 
meanwhile us director of national intelligence james clapper also warned about the consequences of clintons push for a nofly zone in syria that could spark a conflict with russia 
speaking at the council on foreign relations clapper said clintons proposal for the establishment of a nofly zone in syria could lead to russia shooting down american planes there james clapper the us director of national intelligence speaks at the council of foreign relations on october   in new york city 
i wouldnt put it past them to shoot down an american aircraft if they  if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground he said 
i take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they  why they did that clapper said of russian weapons recently deployed to syria the system they have there is a very advanced airdefense system its very capable and i dont think theyd do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it 
during the third and final presidential debate last week clinton reiterated her remarks on a nofly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in syria 
a foreignbacked militancy has been going on in syria since march  with a plethora of armed groups  each supported by one foreign country or another  fighting the assad government 
since  the united states along with a number of its allies has been leading a socalled antiterror campaign in syria and neighboring iraq 
instead of helping to rein in the takfiri terrorists the air raids have killed many civilians and caused extensive damage to the countrys infrastructure 
iran has been offering syria advisory military help russia another syrian ally has also been conducting an aerial bombardment campaign against militant positions in syria at a request from damascus

Beau Albrecht,how a communist brainwashing method was exported to the united states,"a favorite trope of feminists and women claiming workplace discrimination is that female staff are the victims of sexism due to judgments about their appearance but how many times have we all seen girls working in our building or out on their lunch breaks in attire more befitting of a tinder date raunchy nightclub strip joint or even the gym meanwhile men must keep their fashion within a very narrow range of acceptability otherwise they risk failing to get that fancy new job or could lose their current one
furthermore guys learn to deal with the fact that the world does judge you based on your appearance many women have zero idea about this concept only accepting the judgments they agree with or those ones that further their interests and career for those opinions they dont like they can always conveniently claim the person giving them is sexist or misogynist or just as amorphously objectifying a woman this is classic attentionseeking
attentionwhore jayde phoenix
the epitome of this growing female narcissism is a british woman by the name of jayde phoenix  touting herself as a it security expert despite her academic and job credentials being a fraction of what it means to be highly qualified or plain nonexistent she suggested a guess the number of usbs in a jar competition to promote her company with her breasts nearly spilling out of a seethrough top she looked at the camera with a lustful gaze what many on the roosh v forum would call a thousand cock stare her clothes and demeanor better suited a street hooker than a professional
as we should have expected in our troubled times the many critics of phoenixs contrived appearance were labeled as sexists bullies and misogynists she herself tried to excoriate her detractors emphasizing how good she was at her job and the professional standards she supposedly meets every day but there are a few questions both the original photo exercise and her subsequent justifications failed to answer namely
if shes so good at her job why did she need to use a seethrough bra in the picture why doesnt she wear a top size that comfortably contains her breasts rather than flaunting them why is she and not someone else in the photo though the attentionseeking of jayde and her employer first flared up several months ago the dilemma of girls like her is an ongoing one
try getting employed in an office as a man with this sort of attire baggy pants with your underwear showing 
the male office worker could be wearing black pants and not jeans like in the photo and sporting a typical business shirt that doesnt matter no white collar company worth a dime is going to hire a man whose boxers or briefs are showing down to his ass compare this to the parade of female office workers who go beyond showing their arms and the hint of a bra strap to exhibiting half the surface area of their breasts in addition if you havent already noticed the very short crop top is now a staple garment within american office unculture it is not unusual to see a large part of a womans bare stomach and back including overthetop tattoos
hawaiian shirts and board shorts 
some workplaces most notably those trying to appear hip have drastically relaxed the need for business attire but these employers are definitely in the minority a man with a penchant for hawaiian shirts board shirts or other beach clothing will find his career options drastically limited as they should be the way in which you relate to your friends or fellow tourists on a holiday is almost always far different from how you should deal with clients investors stakeholders and the like in your profession men save their best or worst hawaiian shirt for office charity fundraising days company summer parties and related functions not an average day
leather lycra or ridiculously tight clothing in general 
inasmuch as tight clothing on men doesnt tickle your or my fancy its how ironic how an obese woman can wear garments twice or thrice as closefitting in the workplace than a fit male and male office workers of the world dont even consider wearing leather pants during your next boardroom presentation the occasional gay man or metrosexual might escape sanction for some outlandish or garish outfit but most industries if they value their reputation with clients will prohibit you from donning clothing that looks like it came from the wardrobe of lance armstrong or someone from queer eye for the straight guy 
excuses for female attentionseeking are out of control it seems that lady victoria hervey and jayde phoenix read the same book
there is little doubt that jayde phoenixs employer expected a backlash against her in this sense it was a very good marketing and advertising ploy for those prospective clients who do not care about actual professionalism of which there are many as for phoenix and other women like her this situation is winwin at the very least she and those of her ilk can continue their daytoday objectification of themselves generating desperately craved male attention in particular even for girls who do not receive the publics spotlight any roadblock or mishap in their career can later be blamed on misogyny after judgments about their appearance
at best as happened in phoenixs situation she gets nationwide and even global coverage for narcissistic girls who take zero responsibility for how others may negatively perceive them this is the coup of a lifetime yet as they age and jayde phoenix looks far older than her early s expect their antics to become more strawclutching and while these girls engage in sexual selfadvancement and wage war over imaginary discriminations the vast majority of male employees have no scapegoat they can use to rationalize their failures and virtually no means of combating institutionalized prejudice against their socalled privilege
by the way is jayde phoenixs arabic necklace indicative of some work she may have done in dubai

millions of americans are expecting a new golden age for america under donald trump but is that what they are going to get there is always optimism when a new president is elected but i dont know if i have ever seen anything like the euphoria that many trump supporters are expressing right now look i voted for donald trump and i want him to be as successful as possible but when donald trump becomes our next president on january th  that does not mean that all of the great problems that our nation is facing will somehow magically disappear if you listen to some people they make it sound like america is going to experience nothing but peace prosperity and blessing for decades to come i would love it if that was indeed going to be the case but unfortunately that is simply not the truth 
we are currently on a path that leads to national suicide and unless we change our ways it isnt going to matter who is in the white house 
i keep hearing about how our new president is going to unify the nation but that is going to be extremely difficult to do considering the fact that we are now more divided than ever in fact a brand new gallup survey found that an alltime record high  percent of all americans believe that we are greatly divided when it comes to the most important values  
i keep hearing about how we are now entering a golden age of peace and prosperity but how is that supposed to happen while we are still butchering millions of innocent children in our abortion mills 
i keep hearing about how the economy is about to take off like a rocket but how is that possible when we have already been on the greatest debt binge in world history  the only way we have been able to maintain our massively inflated debtfueled standard of living is by piling up debt at a faster pace than any generation in history today we have accumulated  trillion dollars in consumer debt corporate debt has doubled since the last financial crisis and the national debt is rapidly approaching  trillion dollars how can trump possibly pump up our standard of living with debt more than obama has already done 
i keep hearing about how we are going to make america great again but how can we be great when we are producing more pornography than the rest of the world combined 
i keep hearing about how law and order is going to restored but meanwhile chaos has already been erupting in cities all over the nation and the far left is planning to turn inauguration day into a major riot  
i keep hearing about how things are going to go back to the way they used to be but as i discussed in a previous article  sexuallytransmitted diseases are spreading at the fastest pace in decades the percentage of births out of wedlock is more than  times higher than in  and approximately two out of every three christian men watch pornography on a regular basis 
i keep hearing about how we are going to drain the swamp and yet there are no plans to even reform the federal reserve system which is at the very heart of our financial problems as a nation  
i keep hearing about how good judges are going to be put on the supreme court but how can we trust that when our new president just said that he is fine with the supreme court decision that forced all  states to redefine the institution of marriage 
i keep hearing about how we are going to be an example for the rest of the world but how can we be an example when just about every form of evil imaginable is exploding in popularity inside our own country 
i keep hearing about how our government is going to be blessed but how can a government that gives hundreds of millions of dollars a year to planned parenthood be blessed now that the republicans have control of the white house the senate and the house of representatives this is their golden opportunity to defund planned parenthood if it doesnt happen now it probably will never happen and it will show what a complete and utter failure the republican party has become remember planned parenthood is an organization that has been caught on camera admitting that they harvest organs from the babies that they kill and that they sell those organs off to the highest bidder 
some would argue that america is already great at a lot of things after all the united states is number one in the world in television watching legal drug use and illegal drug use 
we lead the world in plastic surgery eating disorder deaths teen pregnancy and lawyers per capita 
we have the highest std infection rate in the industrialized world the highest divorce rate in the industrialized world and the largest prison population on the entire planet 
we also have the most complicated tax system in the entire world the largest trade deficit in the entire world and the largest national debt in the entire world 
so if we want to make america great again we sure have a lot of work to do 
the complacency that i am seeing out there right now really alarms me so many people seem to think that the battle is won because donald trump was victorious on election night but that is not even close to reality 
if we do not fundamentally change course as a nation we will not survive tinkering with tax rates regulations and trade agreements is not going to get the job done so many people are acting as if we just have a few cuts and scratches when the reality is what our country really needs is major heart surgery 
donald trump is not some sort of a messiah and even if he is able to accomplish every single thing that he is promising right now it will not nearly be enough 
but for the moment millions of americans are proclaiming peace and safety now that donald trump has won the election and we shall see how it all turns out november st   tags americans  anxiety  blessing  donald trump  national suicide  peace  safety  successful  suicide  trump  category commentary we are being set up for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,85.16960871803,47,8,6017,1095,4.453881278538812,1095.0,-0.4573785492295443,-0.3899286096724409,0.8038222963837771,0.9386556136929176,-0.6269203823480386,0.97219843285581,0.0027397260273972,0.0,0.0,0,2,0.0,0.0059032051819102,0.9972,0.156,0.106,0.738,Positive,Very Strong
-NO AUTHOR-,woman eaten alive by daughters dogs,"print sidebyside of bill clinton and danney williams 
new york youtube on wednesday suspended the account of danney williams the yearold who has claimed since the s to be the black son of former president bill clinton 
youtube citing repeated or severe violations of our terms of use andor community guidelines declared the account cannot be restored 
the youtube decision blocked the nineminute feature banished  the untold story of danney williams which had received  million views since williams posted it last week produced by filmmaker joel gilbert it drew nearly  views per day and more than  viewer comments with the overwhelming majority expressing support for williams and outrage at the clintons for not being willing to allow a dna test to determine paternity 
like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network 
my youtube account has been deleted but the same video appears in  other places on youtube alone williams said on his facebook page after being notified of youtubes decision youtube cant handle the truth please share billclintonson 
twitter also continues to allow williams to post the banished video on danney williams page  but the twitter link to youtube displays the message  this video is no longer available because the youtube account associated with this video has been terminated sorry about that 
the video is still running on danney williamsclintons facebook page  as well as on the youtube channel operated by gilbert 
attempt to silence danney williams 
gilbert told wnd he helped williams file an online appeal form on youtube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated 
the behavior of youtubegoogle in suspending danneys account is outrageous there have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any youtube terms or guidelines gilbert said 
gilbert was outspoken in charging youtube with partisan political motives for the suspension 
the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danney to run him off the plantation as danney said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in  gilbert said 
danney cannot be silenced any longer he continued hillary may try to sweep danney williams under the rug but its not going to work this time his story is out there and every day more and more people understand bill and hillary clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin 
see the danney williams video feature 
wnd reported oct  that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate attorneys for williams were in las vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding dna evidence from the former president 
accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating williams that went viral on the internet 
no definitive dna test 
wnd reported that no dna test was conducted in  despite media reports to the contrary when williams claim first surfaced 
clinton defenders since  have contended the tabloid star magazine conducted a dna showdown proving bill clinton was not williams father citing star magazine editor phil bunton saying at the time there was no match nothing even close 
but in an interview bunton told wnd that no blood sample was obtained from clinton and star magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test 
i dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on clintons dna bunton told wnd 
bunton is now the owner of the rivertown magazine in haverstraw new york 
he affirmed to wnd that the tabloid relied on the dna evidence for clinton published by independent counsel kenneth starr extracted from the infamous monica lewinsky blue dress 
we got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media including the new york times wanting to know when we were going to get the dna back bunton recalled to wnd we thought it was going to turn out to be his son but when the dna came back there was no story there even to write 
the dna test released by kenneth starr was the second of two dna laboratory tests the fbi had run on clinton but the public record leaves no doubt that starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the fbi 
twitter rules 
many other figures who have challenged the democratic party or the leftleaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets including james okeefe and his project veritas which has exposed clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hiddencamera videos just as okeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud oct  twitter shut down his account  claiming violations of twitter rules the notice said he must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules which prohibit harassing other users threatening other users disclosing other users private information or violating other rules in a statement okeefe said he relies on social media to bypass the media and directly reach the public on monday okeefe wrote in a tweet project veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to youtube calling the apparent block bizarre earlier this month okeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a hillary clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day his account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hiddencamera video that exposed a clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns the daily caller reported  project veritas posted an undercover video oct  proving hillary clinton supporters were inciting violence at donald trump rallies to gain negative media coverage millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours but it didnt show up on googles trending list on youtube which google owns noted silenceisconsentnet  it did however trend on twitter which google does not own breitbart blogger milo yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by twitter minutes before his gays for trump party at the republican national convention for some  months the makers of the new movie im not ashamed about the first victim of the columbine killers in colorado in  were unable to promote their movie through youtube the trailer was taken down late in  and the movies entire channel was suspended

the anarchist political observer noam chomsky has over the years espoused a strategy of voting for the democrat in swing states recently chomsky with john halle propounded  an eight point brief for lev lesser evil voting 
chomsky questions the ethicalmoral principle rejecting lev since lesser evil voting is designed to minimize evil as futile as lesser evilism is it is also futile to discuss there being a lesser evilism between the two utterly dominant rightist political parties in the united states lev in fact is an equally contemptible or greater evil
chomsky though sensibly cautions that challenges to the politicalbusiness duopoly needs to be contemplated with a full awareness of their possible consequences what are the possible consequences chomsky suggests a trump presidency should it materialize will undermine the burgeoning movement centered around the sanders campaign particularly if it is perceived as having minimized the dangers posed by the far right however another consequence is equally possible a horrendous slide to the right would spur progressives to coalesce among a leftist democrat andor it might finally cause former or potential democrats to reject the chicanery of the businessdominated democrats and embrace the progressivist platform of the green party
this costbenefit strategic accounting seriously pushes for progressivist change
focusing on the electoral system however must not be the endall and beall for bringing about progressivism in the us grassroots organizing and activism must continue to inform oppose poverty and impoverishment oppose war and violence and push for human rights and equal opportunity for all people  during electoral periods and between election cycles

 voting should not be viewed as a form of personal selfexpression or moral judgement directed in retaliation towards major party candidates who fail to reflect our values or of a corrupt system designed to limit choices to those acceptable to corporate elites
no argument with this
 the exclusive consequence of the act of voting in  will be if in a contested swing state to marginally increase or decrease the chance of one of the major party candidates winning
this is true of the individual act of voting the individual in solitude has little sway over the electoral result that is an obvious given however when a consciousness sweeps across a multitude of likeminded individuals then enormous potentials emerge this desire for a change from the effete status quo is arguably what occurred with the almost breakthrough candidacy of bernie saunders and it is also what happened in a dissimilar manner with the candidacy of donald trump chomsky has framed the exclusive consequence of the act of voting as the result of an individualistic action and it is but individuals can and do at times form a wider consciousness measurable by statistically rigorous polling results that has potential ramifications on a much greater scale that mere margins an example of this would be the expression of voter disgust in the canadian federal election of  following two successive majority governments led by the brian mulroney tories a voting tsunami washed away all but two tory seats in the seat parliament the conservatives had been around since  but the electoral demolition led to the eventual dissolution of the tories
 one of these candidates trump denies the existence of global warming calls for increasing use of fossil fuels dismantling of environmental regulations and refuses assistance to india and other developing nations as called for in the paris agreement the combination of which could in four years take us to a catastrophic tipping point trump has also pledged to deport  million mexican immigrants offered to provide for the defense of supporters who have assaulted african american protestors at his rallies stated his openness to using nuclear weapons supports a ban on muslims entering the us and regards the police in this country as absolutely mistreated and misunderstood while having done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order trump has also pledged to increase military spending while cutting taxes on the rich hence shredding what remains of the social welfare safety net despite pretenses
much of what trump stands for is anathema true there is no need to defend this man however trump stakes out important positions diametrical to hillary clinton for example clintons advocacy of a nofly zone over syria her saber rattling with russia her corporatefriendly policy toward socalled free trade deals
chomsky cleverly anticipated such an objection writing
 with respect to point  which some will challenge by citing the claim that clintons foreign policy could pose a more serious menace than that of trump
in any case while conceding as an outside possibility that trumps foreign policy is preferable most of us not already convinced that that is so will need more evidence than can be aired in a discussion involving this statement furthermore insofar as this is the fact of the matter following the logic through seems to require a vote for trump though its a bit hard to know whether those making this suggestion are intending it seriously
first chomsky concedes an outside possibility that trumps foreign policy is preferable in other words chomsky posits an inside possibility one assumes that chomsky is saying that there is the strongest likelihood that clintons foreign policy is preferable without any substantiation of why this would be so second he raises an unreasonable demand for evidence that trump will follow a less menacing foreign policy than clinton given that trump has never held political office no such evidence exists what does exist is plenty of evidence that clinton will pursue a menacing foreign policy there is no reason to assume clinton would reduce the number of american military bases overseas or curtail military spending in fact it is likelier that she would increase military spending she will also likeliest resort to a us military attack to bring about regime change in syria pushing the us closer to military confrontation with russia trumps detractors compare his bombastic rhetoric unfavorably to clintons rhetoric but toward putin or assad clintons undiplomatic utterances are on record
moreover following chomskys logic while the more preferable policies of trump lack evidence by the same token the more objectionable policies of trump also lack evidence for the same reason trump has no political track record upon which to judge what he would do if in the oval office thus following this chomskyian logic one could not pass judgement on hardly of trumps pronouncements would he really build a wall on the mexicous border where is the evidence for this would trump really ban muslims from entering the us where is the evidence for this
by effectively undermining trumps peacemongering visàvis clintons warmongering chomsky by the same logic undermines criticisms of the regressivist political utterances by trump thus following chomskys logic through it seems a bit hard to know whether his suggestion is intended seriously
 the suffering which these and other similarly extremist policies and attitudes will impose on marginalized and already oppressed populations has a high probability of being significantly greater than that which will result from a clinton presidency
one assumes that chomsky refers to the domestic population here trumps policies  if he is true to his word to protect jobs for american workers and punish offshoring of american jobs along with his opposition to the tpp  would be a political reversal for neoliberalization clintonomics would be decidedly worse for marginalized and oppressed peoples at home and abroad the economic plight of students the poor and ill however would be much better under a jill stein presidency 
the economic plight of students the poor and ill would be much better under a jill stein presidency
if chomsky is referring to the preponderant violence of us foreign policy and its oppressive and genocidal on populations then i agree with his basic moral principle not only must we take responsibility for our actions but the consequences of our actions for others are a far more important consideration than feeling good about ourselves under the democratic administration hundreds of thousands have died millions of people have been displaced and terrorist organizations have proliferated this is the evidence from clintons time in political office thus a vote for clinton is predictably a vote that will lead to a continuation perhaps even a ramping up of the suffering of others basic morality suggests to this writer to steer clear of casting such an oppressionenabling vote
 should constitute sufficient basis to voting for clinton where a vote is potentially consequentialnamely in a contested swing state
i contend that chomskys basis for  is false or questionable first chomsky has staunchly argued that we should concentrate foremost on the wrongful actions and crimes of our own state because they are something we can have an influence over but it seems that chomsky believes that trump will supersede clintons record of killing in iraq libya and syria clinton is not going to close us military abroad trump has called these bases into question and if one concentrates on the domestic population at least the rhetoric of trump against socalled free trade agreements and offshoring us factories abroad bodes well for the american worker
 however the left should also recognize that should trump win based on its failure to support clinton it will repeatedly face the accusation based in fact that it lacks concern for those sure to be most victimized by a trump administration
this criticism is antidemocratic furthermore the criticism applies conversely chomskys citing the accusation gives it a veneer of credence effectively it leads to the perpetuation of the businessparty duopoly the records of the bill clinton and barack obama administrations demonstrate the futility of such a proffered rationale clinton deregulated the finance sector exposed american workers to the vagaries of free trade implemented regressive welfare policies and continued aggressive us militarism abroad obama bailing out the banks attempts to cut back social security warring in afghanistan libya yemen and syria drone strikes confrontation with russia and china tpp and the lingering incarceration at guantanamo bay it is important to note that democrats arguably have a freer hand to implement rightist policy than republicans have since many supporters of democrats will mute their opposition to avoid providing succor to the republicans george bush was stymied from tinkering with social security notably obama has done an aboutface on social security and proposed an expansion picking up on the popularity for such a measure from the bernie saunders candidacy
 often this charge will emanate from establishment operatives who will use it as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the democratic party or outside of it they will ensure that it will be widely circulated in mainstream media channels with the result that many of those who would otherwise be sympathetic to a left challenge will find it a convincing reason to maintain their ties with the political establishment rather than breaking with it as they must
it is true that establishment operatives will use lev as a bad faith justification for defeating challenges to corporate hegemony either in the democratic party or outside of it that was the case when ralph nader ran it is the case when cynthia mckinney ran and it is when jill stein runs the corporate media and even many socalled progressives will trot out this timeworn argument with each election cycle as long as enough people buy into the premise then the status quo will persist the result is that a rightwing government always assumes office in washington this bodes ill for the poor and working class it bodes poorly for nation states designated as enemy states by the us
 conclusion by dismissing a lesser evil electoral logic and thereby increasing the potential for clintons defeat the left will undermine what should be at the core of what it claims to be attempting to achieve
conclusion by buying into a lesser evil electoral logic the corporatepolitical duopoly will remain in power to continue policies that primarily benefit the  and their goals for further enrichment to unfetter finance to pursue a belligerent foreign policy  a policy that seeks to placate the militaryindustrial establishment and to further entrench corporate domination of the electoral system all of this is at crosshairs with what should be at the core of what progressives claim to be attempting to achieve
final comments
the tragedy of opting for lesser evilism is that the people get evil
some leftist commentators argue that there is no evilism  i found that to be preposterous barack obama was the socalled lesser evil the previous two election cycles obama is not a lesser evilist he is the man who enables evil  the cycles of usbacked violence and killing in places such as gaza syria bahrain afghanistan yemen and somalia underscore the utter futility of pandering to a perceived lesser evilism if one votes for a degree of evil then one should not be surprised when evil results
progressivism demands that social justice activists repudiate evil morality dictates that people should not live in fear of being killed a genuine peacemongering us president is needed to stop the killing and save lives consequently both democrats and republicans are anathema given the present candidates if people vote then the only conscionable vote is for someone not of the business party factions
only a propeace third party will set the us on a new path  outside of a revolution the election of a propeace third party is the only moral direction on the horizon for americans truly interested in steering their country toward peace and rehabilitating the ensanguined us reputation such a third party vote however may well augur the birth of a revolution on many promising fronts",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,2.2264292892673696,8,2,14554,2341,5.1990602306706535,2341.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,3.062470639061605,2.891985878112411,0.1084981632204821,2.971196792619206,0.0021358393848782,0.0,0.0008543357539513,0,1,0.0,0.0038610186492159,-0.9992,0.101,0.142,0.757,Negative,Very Strong
Jason Easley,democrats may get a  for  special as trump defeat could take out paul ryan,"on meet the press clinton campaign manager robbie mook said that early voting is so strong for democrats in nevada that hillary clinton could build an insurmountable lead this week 
video 
chuck todd asked mook if he believed the email story could cost clinton the election 
he answered 
i dont think so look as i said we have over  volunteers out there were seeing record early voting numbers in north carolina florida look i would wager in nevada turnout is so strong among democrats there hillary could build an insurmountable lead in the coming days in nevada were feeling really good about this record turnout over  million people in our country now registered to vote fifty million of those are young people were just nose to the grindstone and were going to finish this out but people should not take anything for granted and were going to have to work hard to earn this 
hillary clinton could put nevada out of reach for trump this week but whether or not that happens is up to the voters if democrats continue to vote in overwhelming numbers in swing states the email story wont matter if democrats dont show up that is trumps only chance of winning 
the early voting numbers that hillary clinton is running up in florida north carolina and nevada are no accident clinton and the democratic party have invested heavily in an extensive get out the vote operation in early voting states 
democrats already had a strategic advantage in early voting before the  election but donal trumps refusal to invest in a substantial get out the vote operation has widened the gap between the two parties in this area 
the final week before the election could be just as vital to democrats in swing states as election day if hillary clinton piles up big margins in early voting it could leave minimal drama for election night 
the democratic early voting plan is working to perfection now as mook said all that is left is for democrats to put their heads down work hard and close the deal

the reason that american police love just shooting people instead of actually working and risking their safety for the safety of the people is because they are blood thirsty cowboy dirty harry brain washed psychopaths that love killing it is american culture at the root deep in the psyche 
the police have been militarized they dont do the job like in the old days no more negotiators drs or counselling at the scene of the crisis its just shoot bang bang boom yourr dead if you had a gun knife glow stick sandwich whatever gary honeycutt 
how old are you the old days you mention with negotiators and counselors came into vogue nationally in the s after a period of democrat rule notable for their most outstanding accomplishment a huge escalation of criminals rights over those of victims note the escalation of crime since then it seems you are also on the anticop bandwagon i support them being able to defend themselves mistakes can be made in a split second the same amount of time it might take for a criminal to kill a cop im sure you can name victims of cops do you realize what a small percentage of interactions between cops and the public they constitute unfortunately the justified shootings like the ferguson case are unfairly included in many of our perceptions first and foremost dont commit crime that improves your odds drastically next comply with orders given by the police if you were raised to treat the police as hostile someone failed you guilty or innocent comply the police are just trying to do their job dont complicate it ive seen many an arrest where a person taunts and struggles with the police even up to resisting being put in the car try walking a mile in their shoes they are trying to keep the public safe and they have a right to be safe themselves fluffnik 
guilty or innocent comply 
land of the free 
most places are successfully policed by consent and without shooting their citizens or suffering much crime gary honeycutt 
yes if an officer wants to see identification he has a reason if he wants you to keep your hands in plain sight he has a reason he is possibly ruling you out as a person of interest that was seen in the area imagine how much more efficiently that would go if each person would refrain from shouting about their rights for  minutes before complying if you are the person in question the transaction could be handled in a couple of minutes and youll be gone without any violence or hard feelings if you pay taxes you will have helped us get our moneys worth of course if youve seen the news and the reality shows you may have the impression that a lot of these guys that are giving a cop a load of crap probably live off of what you are paying to the government mike 
wasnt raised hostile to cops family members are cops as a matter of fact this is america if im not committing a crime or suspected of it dont ask me for papers dont detain me dont run dui checkpoints those are infringements on all of our freedom which i assume we love safety is what the left uses to excuse their behavior safety is a fallacy dufas_duck 
i have had  police officers in my extended family it got to the point that none of them were welcome into the rest of the familys homes they were eventually never invited to family get to gathers they were rude overbearing malicious individuals constantly bragging how they screwed some person and taught them how the world really should be their treatment of family members were more along the line of petty dictators where no matter the subject some familly member was wrong petty things like they didnt like the car they bought or their haircut or the job they worked at they were not satisfied with anything or anybody 
they brought their street attitude home with them they couldnt keep wives or husbands or significant others for very long they were arrogant mean and only thaought of themselvesanybody else was in their way 
i have seen gang members that have more ethics than these police and their freinds gary honeycutt 
my greatgrandfather his soninlaw my grandfatherand his son my uncle were all cops the oldest and youngest for their whole careers all deeply religious highly moral men dufas_duck 
that is great if they were straight arrow we need more like them my cop relatives and their friends would fit right in in the crips the bloods or just about any outlaw motorcycle club no one but other cops were proud of them my family sure wasnt proud of them gary honeycutt 
maybe they became hardened by what they faced daily east side of detroit south side of chicago people are products of their environment maybe the cops in branson mo and such places are nice guys what is the ratio of cops to citizens lets say youve got a playground with   year olds you get a dozen  year olds to keep order among them if the  are from sierra leone and the dozen are american boy scouts thered be  dead americans in short order any dead among the  wouldve been killed by their own so what do we expect of cops who grew up without a rap sheet graduated from school and passed the academy you think  years of patrolling the gnetto might change them they surely know the realities of the job better than we do how do the ones who arent in mayberry do a  or  year career in an inner city where shooting a cop makes you a hero and not resisting arrest makes you a pussy dufas_duck 
i do know that where i grew up the police at least tried to keep the officers from getting street hardened they rotated officers to different districts every month but then they found thst the police were trading assignments some cops didnt want to rotate out they wanted to stay where they were no explaination was given by any officerat least publically no answer was given 
many thought the cops were up to no good and wanted to stay in their own area to protct their interst dufas_duck 
you just gave the cops an excuse to act like gang members gary honeycutt 
i dont think so but you dont throw choirboys in blue to the wolves in the ghetto any more than you send a seal team to lifeguard the kiddie pool dufas_duck 
 send a seal team to lifeguard the kiddie pool 
you havent checked out what school cops have been doing as of late then a  year old in handcuffs or throwing an  year old to the ground doesnt work out to be the way to increase trust among the populace anthony fredericks 
i will end this stupidity of your right now gary i work with police every single day as a emt every day i am a qualified expert on how police act on scenemost of them are very arrogant rude and aggressive towards people shut up or be quiet is the first thing you normally hear from a cop you always see them put someone on the ground even if that person is the one who called them for help if they dont like youboom face down knee on your neck cuffs on approximately  are not like this but the other  are this is reality gary and i have worked in several cities in different areasand it is all the same police are overbearing and have a chip on their shoulder against the general publicand a lot of them take it out physically on them gary honeycutt 
my sympathies for the flaw in your familys dna dufas_duck 
luckily the flaw was only in the extended family treeinlaws marriages etc  gary honeycutt 
most people who oppose dui checkpoints have a reason ive always seen a problem with bars having parking lots when it is illegal for good reason to drink and drive i dont mind providing my id when a cop asks for it when its done without giving him any lip it is over quickly without incident hes just trying to do the job we are paying for if you want to launch into a  minute tirade about your rights youll be there  minutes longer make it a bad night at work for the cop and wind you all up maybe you like that some people love drama mike 
the reason is its an infringement on your rights and unnecessarily exposes you and the officers to a potentially dangerous confrontation there is no way you believe that unwanted contact that is forced upon officers and the public increases their safety i wouldnt blame the officers for the policies they have to enforce however the higher ups never pay when things go wrong after the fact the problem with being law abiding is that by doing nothing wrong you dont see the infringement of your rights and tolerate them just because you arent guilty of anything doesnt mean your rights arent being taken from you what if for safety we decided that all firearms need removed from private citizens what if we decided that tsa should run mandatory random checkpoints all over the us creating  hour delays what if we decided that anyone that supports trump may be a violent extremist and should be stopped for questioning do you see where this goes 
i dont like the immigration ones inside the states of the southwest i dont like the agricultural ones into california and i dont like the dui checkpoints in the south im a legal resident dont transport crops and dont drink yet i oppose all of them the idea behind them is wellmeaning the execution is unlawful imo obviously the courts dont think so or theyd not exist gary honeycutt 
it is the officers job to initiate that confrontation despite the risk to himself he does it to lessen the chance that a drunk will run over you daughter at a crosswalk he stops people who fit the description of a wanted person in hopes of catching a criminal before he claims another victim perhaps raping your daughter what would you do in his place mike 
you are confusing the issues here zero issue stopping and talking with someone who is suspected or witnessed committing a crime 
dui checkpoints are  stop and question with zero probable cause have you been in states where they run these the road is barricaded even turning around prior to the checkpoint leads to confrontation with the police as you are assumed to be committing a crime for not wanting to be questioned you are within your rights to be polite and refuse the checkpoint but the fact that they exist trouble me as do any checkpoints as they are not based on probable cause gary honeycutt 
and youve seen these checkpoints at pm by a suburban baptist church no the probable cause lies in them being near the strip at am where there is a history of alcoholrelated incidents mike 
i lived in the south these things were not targeting a specific demographic as far as i could tell and while not at pm that i can recall they werent that late and they sure could have been in front of a baptist church i could have been naive about who was being targeted i wasnt just waived through once they saw my skin color but my point is that the location doesnt matter nor does the target demographic if there is one they are unjust and just like every other forced interaction with law enforcement does not serve to increase the safety of leos 
if police pull me over because a car that looks like mine just robbed a quickie mart or a guy like me was just reported for beating his wife or ran off with a kid i do not have a problem with that they have probable cause and the risk to their safety and mine is worth it because they may be stopping a criminal stop me detain me for a reasonable time until they can prove i am or am not who they are looking for then let me be on my way 
however ive been stopped in a rural area for making a right turn on red perfectly legal in my state and the officer was a complete ass enough that had i a short fuse it could have quickly escalated after that encounter and talking with the state about why the previously posted no turn on red sign had been removed from that intersection for a couple of months the fact that this officers supervisor backed him up for an unlawful stop and threatening that they could have written me up and i would have to prove in court i didnt break the law just proved to me that some police are uninterested in doing what is right depending on the circumstances that officer had no reason to stop me although i suspect since it was near his house and he is a rural county officer he couldnt control his road rage and by doing so he put himself at risk as well as me there are a million what ifs in that situation not the least of which was the fact that even though he pulled me over in the dark along a fairly rural road by himself he didnt call in the stop which is procedure for that department i could have ended up shot or he could have and dispatch would have never known 
increasing negative interaction with the public is never in a leos best interest for safety and reputation of the police as a whole dufas_duck 
i guess thats why the police looking for a skinny black man that is wearing a white sweatshirt and is  foot that just commited a robbery would shoot a short foot  kid wearing a dark gray sweat shirt in the back as he was walking down the sidewalk at a fast pace turned out that the man they shot was pizza delivery in a hurry to deliver the next order before it cooled off 
police shooting two small white females in a light blue pickup truck while the cops were looking a huge black man in a dark gray pickup truck is perfectly aok 
in the town that i live in police shot and killed a  year old kid while he slept maybe we should all congraduate the officer because he only used three bullets he could have emptied his clip 
maybe the cops that you love are making things more efficient by killing anyone and everyone to save the taxpayers that you are so worried about any money a couple of bullets is cheaper than some cops time to find out what really is going on 
of course some of those evil peoples relitives will probably sue but so what the tax payers will take care of that 
how do you feel about cops who demand sex from some random female and when she refuses gets arrested for your noncompliance 
you would love my uncle he was a cop and really got off when he could beat or kill someone after about fifteen years of bullying beating killing and making false charges against people the force finally fired himmeanwhile he ruined hundreds of lives and they were not you welfare people that he abused it was anybody he could screw with 
but in your mind police can do no wrongmaybe you are right police are always telling us that they never do anything wrong especialy when they investigate themselves or have a friendly agency do the investigation gary honeycutt 
i dont deny that there are a small percentage of cops that shouldnt be or wrong splitsecond decisions sometimes think about how many police officers there have been over the span of time you draw your examples from think about the number of times per day that an leo comes in contact with a citizen that taken into account bad contacts are extremely rare the sensationalism of all these female teachers having sex with students is stuck in everyones mind but they dont consider the huge number of teachers and students and note how statistically rare these incidents are the incidents dont sour me on the entire education system we need law enforcement you are good at pointing out the flaws but do you have a solution will any form of policing be perfect what is dufas_duck 
how about having honest police and policing while percentage wise there is a small number of truley bad cops but there is always a but a large percentage of your good cops will keep silent lie or even cover for the bad cops that extends up through the ranks to the top of the police forces those honest cops that do come forward are setting themselves up to fail and eventually destroy their careerscops dont like whistleblowers 
the example you used teachers having sex with students is perfect once it is found that a teacher has crossed the line even a suspicion that the teacher has done something will bring immeadiate consequenses not so within the police a bad policeman can get away with things multiple times sometimes going on for years the upper eschalon figures out ways to cover for the errant cop at almost every turn even if convicted the court system will come in later on appeal and remove parts or all of any punishment 
for years the public was kept in the dark about the bad cop very few were brought to justice only the very extreme cases of crooked cops were adjudicated it is just lately after public attention that the police are starting to somewhat clean house 
there are child molesting police officers that are still working as officers many are just put on probation others are allowed to retun to police work after their incarceration 
it would also be a boon to the public if we had a justice system instead of a legal system a legal system can be whatever its practicinors want it to be a justice system looks for truth no matter where it points to quilified and absolute immunity for police das judges does not lend itself to anything close to justice 
police are a necessary evilthe are some evil people in the world it is just too bad that many of them are police officers gary honeycutt 
keep silent lie or even cover turn off the tv and go out i to the world some will agree with you but if youd said the same thing about black people thered be trouble dont you think just about any group might share the same likelihood of bending the rules they also dont like criminals in uniform and are just as likely to line up against a bad apple do cops get away with small indiscretions and occassionally a major crime probably but more so than the general population interesting take on the teacher thing i remember a fellow who got a job as a girls basketball coach at a very small rural school he was no prize in his youth and i guess when an equally awkward underage player on his team developped a crush on him he couldnt resist she got pregnant and to add to a volatile situation her uncle was the superintendent of schools flash ahead maybe  years give or take and im a teacher and football coach in that same system at a slightly larger rural school i work with a married couple both tenured teachers probably on full retirement now after full careers without ever being fired downsized transferred or any of the other things that may befall teachers during their careers the hubby is the boys basketball coach and unofficially the assistant principle guess who yep dufas_duck 
ive been out in the world for over  years been beat by cops and then have them later discover i wasnt the perp they were looking for i was only lucky in that the cops didnt make up charges to cover their tails they just lied about what went down and covered for each other in this instance everything happened because i was driving the same make model color and year of vehicle that was used in a felony crime on the way to jail a radio message came in telling the cops to stand down the perp had been caught and identified the cops just turned around and dumped me back at my vehicle 
i think if you would reread what i posted it was the cops that i refered to as being giged for turning in another cop not the teachers in todays world a teacher will be messed with just on a rumer if you as a coach had rumers that you were messing with the kids i dont think you would have lasted in that positionunless you are stating you were messing with the kids and no on ratted on you gary honeycutt 
no i wasnt referring to myself i was an outsider where the good ol boy superintendent had a slew of relatives and even more buddies on the payroll i think the guy in my story shouldve done time and never been allowed to work with kids again dufas_duck 
addendum 
i get the feelig that you are the type that if a policeman makes a mistake the officer should get a pass because everybody makes mistakes police are supposed to be trained on how to back off those split second decisions even in the military soldier makes a mistake and if it is not covered up the soldier faces the consequenses but there are many that think that the killing some kid by a policeman is aok like the two policemen that were canvassing a nieghborhood knocking on doors and a  year old kid opens the door while holding a ps game controller cop shouts gun and  shots lateran innocent kid is dead and bleeding out in his own home while the playstation is running in the background and the cops get another pass thats the kind of policing that you want 
yet a mechanic makes a mistake while repairing or sevicing your vehicle and it leads to a death of an innocent personthe mechanic can be held liable both were mistakeswhy should a mechanic be held responsible and the cop not be anthony fredericks 
theres no excuse for killing a person gary we have laws against that no im sorry brings back people after being killed by over reacting cops no gary accidents like that are not excusable i dont care what job you have soldiers in warzones who kill innocent people are brought up on charges of murder why would it be ok for a stupid beat cop to be able to do it gary honeycutt 
selfdefense is a valid reason and the police have as much right to it as anyone and more likelihood to find themselves in that situation due to the nature of their jobs people like to argue the case of an unarmed attacker should only mma champions be allowed to be cops an unarmed attacker can kill you if someone breaks into my house at night i will do whatever it takes to keep him from doing harm to myself or family i will not wait to see if hes armed or ask his intentions i wont refrain from using a weapon because i dont see him with one it is not a high school wrestling match we wont get up and shake hands after it is decided by score if this same criminal finds me awake and decides to leave at once i will call a cop it is his job to confront this person and resistance by the suspect places him in the same situation i was in when someone invaded my home fluffnik 
i live in scotland where the police do not routinely carry guns mostly noone dies anthony fredericks 
you mean like the guy who got shot in his car for trying to give his id to the cop or maybe you are talking about the social worker that was trying to bring back his autistic patient and the com while he was on his back with his hands straight in the air how about those huh gary i could go on and on but a close minded sheep like you would never see the forest through the trees anthony fredericks 
so gary if i seen you walking towards me on the street got scared because you looked dangerous and i accidentally defended myself by blowing your head off then all i have to say is oh sorry my bad and because accidents happen everything is ok right take your head out of the sandpolice kill people when they think their authority is being challenged not their lives they are protecting their egos mike 
while i wont disagree completely with your statement blanket statements are never correct some police may kill from challenges to authority in most cases it is a kill or be killed split second decision that we not being in the exact same position should not second guess what we should be secondguessing are the supervisors chiefs and elected officials who hire bad cops improperly train their officers and put officers in harms way where they should not be the higherups never pay the price for those under them whose actions they are responsible for that is a very real problem if we want change we need to hold our elected officials responsible for the behavior of the officers that indirectly work for them 
programs such as stop and frisk checkpoints etc all require a confrontation with individuals that do not need to occur that puts officers and the publics lives at risk neither is acceptable the easy solution is to stop making the confrontations occur but you do something stupid michael brown you deserve what you get 
i wish organizations like black lives matter would pick individuals to use as martyrs who were actually victims there are a lot of people who would agree with some of the basic ideas espoused but when you choose the perpetrators of crime who just happened to get theirs as your martyrs you expose your cause as being about something other than justice gary honeycutt 
you can put that example back where you pulled it fromif your head isnt in the way bj 
thats actually standard in every part of the world except usa its normal for police to protect and serve  it is not normal for police to shoot first ask later jack mccauley

Michael Sebastian,what the  election has exposed," reply 
according to numerous reports and stories that have been published through the years among the many alleged secrets the vatican has there is a device called the chronovisor the device enables its user to observe future as well as past events many believe this device is one of the greatest guarded secrets humanity has ever had 
some even believe it is a crucial tool which has allowed the vatican to preserve its influence and power through the years 
ever since h g wells composed his novel the time machine many people have been left fascinated by the idea of time travel even theoretical physics dreams of the possibility of making it work one day everything related to time travel today is related to science fiction or so it seems at least interestingly on may   an italian newspaper shocked the world when they published an article with a provoking headline a machine that photographs the past has finally been invented  
the news article indicated that dozens of scientists created an artifact that allowed them to photograph the past and even witness important historical accounts directly connected with jesus christ 
the alleged device which according to many is nothing more than science fiction was built in the s by a team of scientists led by father pellegrino maria ernetti an italian physicist who eventually became a priest 
it is believed that the team received important help from nobel laureate enrico fermi and famous rocket scientist wernher von braun 
the chronovisor is a relatively small object that is equipped with a number of antennas and is composed entirely of precious alloys cathode tubes some dials and levers reports by father ernetti suggest that whoever uses the device is able to capture and record specific locations important events and follow in history noteworthy individuals according to father ernetti he had observed among other historical events christs crucifixion and photographed it as well view image the image to the left is the one obtained using the chronovisor on the right is a similar image located in a church in perugia 
it is even said that under the perfect conditions the device offers its user the ability to foresee what was going to happen in the near future 
however father ernetti remained secretive and stated he was not at liberty to reveal further details about the chronovisor 
father ernetti did however reveal that the chronovisor worked by processing residual electromagnetic radiation left over by numerous processes 
according to numerous reports father ernetti used the chronovisor to witness important historical events with the most notable being the crucifixion of christ 
however father ernetti revealed that thanks to this invention had managed to witness the destruction of sodom and gomorrah and other major historical events such as the founding of rome in  bc also thanks to the chronovisor father ernetti was able to recompose the missing work thyestes  written by ennio quinto and represented in rome in  ac in its original version and the original text of the the two stone tablets written by god exodus  which were given to moses on mount sinai apart from witnessing the likes of napoleon roman philosopher cicero and other great and momentous historical and biblical episodes 
french priest françois charles antoine brune was one of the first to hear about the chronovisor according to father françois he met father ernetti in the s when the two were traveling across the grand canal of venice as the two were experts in ancient languages they began to talk about the bible and its interpretation through the years supposedly these are the blueprints of the chronoviso r image 
father brune that was very intrigued when the father ernetti revealed that there was a machine that could answer all questions related to the bible 
when father françois asked about the machine father ernetti described the chronovisor saying that it was device that functioned just like a tv but instead of receiving transmissions from local stations the chronovisor was able to tune into the past and allow the viewer to see and hear events that had occurred centuries before 
ernetti told brune that the machine worked by detecting images and sounds that humanity had created which were floating in space 
it is said that this intriguing device and the project behind it were canceled by the vatican but not destroyed some believe the chronovisor is located somewhere in the vatican hidden in one of the many chambers hidden away from society 
however there are other versions that suggest that father ernetti and his team decided to voluntarily dismantle the device because since it could tune anywhere and anytime in the past if it were to fall into the wrong hands it could create the scariest dictatorship the world has ever seen 
interestingly before father ernetti died in april  he wrote a letter in which he insisted that the device was real and was not a hoax as many believed 
father ernetti claimed that the alleged photograph the chronovisor had captured of jesus christ on the cross showing the sorrowful face of a bearded man gazing towards the heavens was real even though some critics argue that the image was a reproduction of a statue of jesus located in a church in perugia 
critics also claim that the alleged text the device managed to observe of thyestes included latin words that did not exist at the time it was made 
in  father ernetti also said that pope pius xii forbade us to do disclose any details about this device because the machine was very dangerous it can restrain the freedom of man 
however in  the vatican issued a decree in which it warned that anyone using an instrument of such characteristics would be excommunicated according to many this was an unnecessary warning since according to them the chronovisor never existed so why issue a warning if it was just another hoax

two bill clinton cronies used their private consulting firm to steer millions in business to the former president while raising funds for the clinton foundation  and even called the arrangement bill clinton inc 
doug band a top clinton aide detailed the complex financial arrangement between his company teneo and the foundation in a memo contained in hacked emails released wednesday by wikileaks 
teneo partners have raised in excess of  million for the foundation more than  million of which is in the bank the memo reads 
teneo partners also have generated over  million in paid speeches for president clinton  million of which has been paid to him thus far 
the consulting company was formed by band and former state department envoy declan kelly the memo about its activities shows the incestuous relationship between the foundation and the private business interests of the former president 
in one arrangement kelly introduced bob mccann the head of ubs wealth management to clinton at an event in  
after the meeting mccann donated hundreds of thousands to the foundation while inviting clinton to give several paid speeches 
another arrangement involved the laureate foundation which donated more than  million to the clinton global initiative 
laureate was a personal advisory services business the memo said paying clinton ?million annually to provide advice and serve as their honorary chairman 
the cozy relationship with the clintons put the baltimorebased laureate at highprofile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe 
the band memo also includes a section about forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc 
some of the speeches secured by teneo include two  addresses delivered to ubs in  and  as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches if he chose to give them 
another secured event was a  million fee for clinton to speak at two onehour sessions during an event in hong kong the fee included  for a private plane 
since  president clintons business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements the memo reads 
the relationship between band and the donors was criticized harshly by daughter chelsea clinton in another email 
chelsea specifically called out band and teneo for hustling business opportunities out of the foundation 
i continue to want  and to try  to disintermediate myself from this muddle edify the corporate audit and existential process we are in  while also being a responsible board member daughter and person chelsea wrote in the  email 
the relationship between foundation donors and hillary clintons state department was raised through emails obtained by citizens united in which top hillary aide huma abedin appeared to vet donors access to the clintons based on their links to the cgi

Jason Easley,three new polls shatter the myth that the presidential election is tightening,"share on twitter print this post 
the fbi is examining how a hillary clinton aide handled emails the examination has nothing to do with the democratic nominee her emails or her email server 
according to newsweeks kurt eichenwald the scandal is related to the process clinton aide huma abedin used to print out emails for the then secretary of state to read 
eichenwald reported because clinton preferred to read documents on paper rather than on a screen emails and other files were often printed out and provided to her either at her office or home where they were delivered in a diplomatic pouch by a security agent abedin like many state department officials found the government network technology to be cumbersome and she had great trouble printing documents there investigative records show as a result she sometimes transferred emails from her unclassified state department account to either her yahoo account or her account on clintons server and printed the emails from there it is not clear whether she ever transferred official emails to the account she used for her husbands campaign 
abedin would use this procedure for printing documents when she received emails she believed clinton needed to see and when the secretary forwarded emails to her for printing abedin told the fbi she would often print these emails without reading them abedin printed a large number of emails this way in part because investigative records show other staff members considered her clintons gatekeeper and often sent abedin electronic communications they wanted the secretary to see 
the entire scandal is about how emails were printed it has nothing to do with how hillary clinton handled emails or classified information the investigation is related to how an aide printed emails for hillary clinton to read no wonder comey didnt provide more details in his letter to congress the details of what is being examined are an embarrassment to the fbi 
there is no evidence that clintons aide committed a crime for the printing of the emails to be deemed criminal there must be evidence that abedin intended to leak classified information there remains zero evidence of criminal activity 
the fbi examination of new emails is turning out to be one of the most overblown red herrings of the  election  and comeys behavior is a disgrace to the us intelligence community 
the new information destroys republican hopes that the new emails were the game changer that could save them from defeat  republicans may spend the remaining days pushing the emails but their behavior will be the hallmark of a desperate party that is facing a crushing defeat 
the emails wont change anything in  but they will give congressional republicans a reason to keep investigating hillary clinton in  and beyond in other words james comey is already delegitimizing hillary clintons potential presidency",politicususa.com,Real,english,100.0,92.2978201200483,77,12,2870,469,5.091684434968017,469.0,0.4598726310629357,0.3616742515005802,-0.0287847475903503,-0.0427125608870207,0.0025287832762611,-0.0321137446818191,0.0042643923240938,0.0833333333333333,0.0,1,2,0.1881358908186271,0.0105627574063927,-0.9387,0.041,0.077,0.883,Negative,Very Strong

Mike Rivero,snow reports from around the northland duluth through  am saturday,"while democrats perpetually circle the wagons republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad the same holds true for many evangelicals democrats and secularists count on it 
and we never disappoint 
full disclosure i went from a dogged never trumper to a maybe trumper and finally settled as a reluctant trumper i like any godfearing father of daughters was and remain appalled by donald trumps sordid past and his yearold vulgar video in which he objectified women his words are indefensible and i fully expect the clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the republican nominee before election day 
still i will be voting against hillary clinton on nov  in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote for better or worse for the policies and promises of donald trump  and for the vice presidency of gov mike pence 
regrettably with many of my never trump friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith pride is an awful thing we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew  foolishness called faith is just foolishness 
even so there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this trump fiasco first those trumpian cultists who buy the make america great again pablum and deride any person who while not casting judgment upon others makes with all sincerity what they view as the principled decision the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard while i appreciate this milder strain of never trumpers sincerity i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong 
and then there are the selfrighteous plankintheeye never trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltinesssinned against god and compromised their principles brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary clintons tyranny in perpetuity 
the media research center has done america a tremendous service in  the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate stared into the camera with cold callous eyes and then both lied about and defended unequivocally i plead with never trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov  
mrs clintons beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother 
during a partialbirth abortion the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion rather than committing murder 
he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt next he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains thereby collapsing her skull 
her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage 
this is homicide plain and simple hillary clinton supports it donald trump opposes it 
we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch in my estimation mrs clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner 
my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs clinton and ensure that she is stopped she must not be elected president to not vote  or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs clinton still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court 
its simple math and its undeniable the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs clinton by voting for mr trump this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations 
with its  roe v wade decision the us supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder since then the battle lines have been drawn this is war prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers the good guys it really is that simple  that black and white its good versus evil

the tape is  minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant such as analysis of the reelection battle that sen joe lieberman was then facing in connecticut but a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the palestinian authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by clintons republican opponent donald trump that the current election is rigged

polisaro claims to lead a moroccan governmentinexile based in tindouf algeria 
theyre doing this because they know hillary has some chances of being president of the united states and they want her to support their brutal occupation of western sahara beisat charged 
the moroccan firm mines phosphates human rights critics have called ocps mining product blood phosphates appropriating the term blood diamonds for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers

the moroccan world news described the meeting as showing renewed friendship between the royal family and the clinton family as well as hillary clintons esteem for morocco and its people 
abedin warned both campaign executives that if cgi decided to renege on the agreement it would hurt clintons relationship with the king it will break a lot of china to back out now she wrote

 make sure to ask for an exact salary before the mans fingers start moving up your leg it might seem daunting at first to directly ask for money but if you dont come with an exact number in mind the man with his hand on your knee will end up confused with little direction information about how much of a bump to give you calculate an appropriate new salary so you can bargain but when you do avoid mentioning the salaries of any other coworkers whose legs he has also touched because this is about you not them 
 dont mention the hand a real negotiator stays on target and doesnt let daytoday work conversations creep into business mentioning or even looking at the hand is a surefire way to upset the man with his hand on your knee and bring the meeting to a close without getting a raise keep your message laserfocused

Madeline,as the super masculine guysmen wakeup your roles change  lisa transcendence brown,"south africa 
issues surrounding a minimum wage bill education and services are being utilized in attempts to overthrow the african national congress 
south african president jacob zuma has come out publically to state that there are efforts underway by the west to undermine the african national congress anc government which has held power for over  years 
a myriad of challenges are facing the south african ruling party including an economic recession the bringing of several allegations about corruption within the office of the presidency a declining stock market and national currency along with increasingly worsening relations with the united states 
in africa there are numerous examples from the postcolonial period of the last five decades where the intelligence and military apparatuses of the imperialist states have sought to reverse the forward progress of the masses of workers farmers youth and their leadership in the recent period in the south american state of brazil the first woman president dilma rousseff of the workers party was forcefully removed from office in a political coup 
in addition to the decline in the south african economy largely due to the overall world crisis which has driven down commodity prices and systematically disinvested from the emerging states there has been a fracturing of the national democratic movement and the workers organizations over contentious debates surrounding a way forward in an october report delivered at the world federation of trade unions wftu  th congress in durban south africa dr blade nzimande the secretary general of the south african communist party sacp placed these contradictions inside the national democratic revolution and the largest trade union federation the congress of south african trade unions cosatu within a broader context of the desire by the imperialist states to reverse the advances of the liberation struggles 
in a recent article published by the agence france press afp president zuma emphasized that western powers want to remove the anc because they do not want the anc to develop relations with those countries which helped the party in the antiapartheid struggle this statement was made by president zuma on nov  laid the blame directly on certain western countries which do not wish the ruling african national congress success 
zuma spoke to anc supporters at a rally in bushbuckridge mpumalanga province that the imperialist states were utilizing some anc members to further their agenda adding that some party members had been won over to the views of western countries the president said that those anc members calling for his resignation were in fact serving the interests of the western states 
the political economy of destabilization 
since  there have been substantial reforms initiated under the anc government there has been the construction of housing for the poor and working class the expansion of healthcare the breaking down of racial barriers in public facilities along with access to household utilities and clean drinking water 
however the fundamental relations and ownership of production remains under the control of the capitalist class as a manifestation of modernday capitalism high unemployment rising costs of living including education fees as well as problems associated with service delivery have continued 
in all other countries the majority controls everything from politics economy and defense    its only in this country south africa where we dont have economic freedom its controlled by the minority and those who oppressed us zuma stressed afp nov  
the president went on to say that is why they are scared that we will take away this economy they want to take away the strength of the anc because they know the anc is the only organization trying to balance the scales 
zuma said that his government would not break ties with longtime friends internationally in order to win the approval of the imperialist governments the president had also spoke at the wftu  th congress noting that the capitalist system would not relinquish concessions to the working class without demands based upon mass struggle 
recounting the history of the national liberation movement in south africa zuma said socialist countries like russia and china helped the anc giving it military training and aid during the antiapartheid struggle the socialist countries came to our aid it was russia who trained us and helped us with the tools to fight china and other socialist countries helped us 
in addition zuma said the western states are retaliating against the anc government due its affiliation with the brazil russia india china and south africa brics summit the advent of such blocs among the emerging states was a threat to western hegemony of the world economy 
they are fighting us because we joined brics some are in anc gear but are in the company of the west we are at war we are going to protect the anc zuma emphasized

debate surrounds a national minimum wage amid allegation of regime change agenda 
the anc government has proposed the adoption of a national monthly minimum wage of  rand which is approximately  us dollars  percent of the working population earns less than this proposed amount bbc nov  
despite the possible introduction of such legislation it falls far short of what is actually needed to maintain a basic household prof chris malikane of the university of witwatersrand in johannesburg suggested that  rand per month was essential in maintaining a decent home bbc nov  
this issue is controversial among the business interests which claim that any significant governmentmandated increase in the minimum wage would create further unemployment which stands officially at around  percent over the last few years there have been largescale job losses in the mining sector which is impacting economic recovery 
two years ago cosatu proposed a minimum wage of  rand per month with inflation since  the amount would be at least  today 
deputy president cyril ramaphosa said the  rand per month figure was decided by a panel of experts ramaphosa said we are now a step closer to finalizing discussions on the national minimum wage all social partners will now decide what their take is bbc nov  
the anc must address the issues of joblessness poverty and service delivery in order to win back its twothirds majority electoral base inside the country local governmental elections which were held in august saw a decline in support for the ruling party by approximately ten points although it remains by far the most popular party in south africa winning  percent of the votes in the august poll 
a commission report issued several weeks ago alleged that the government of president zuma has been involved in corruption zuma has denied the charges and attempts to pass motions of noconfidence in parliament failed on numerous occasions the current anc leadership seems solidly committed to keeping zuma in office until his term expires in  
the party maintains that washington through its embassy in pretoria is pursuing a regimechange agenda party spokesperson zize kodwa stated in march they have taken about  young people to america to train them as part of their leadership program what we got from those young people is not what they expected they were trained on how to destabilize the country and regime change xinhua news agency march ",galacticconnection.com,Fake,english,7.764735341968465,5.755236223263406,81,12,8157,1321,5.131718395155185,1321.0,0.5821727884352664,0.3616742515005802,1.3700056691529643,1.292951472247336,0.042038375824423,1.3347775896026215,0.0015140045420136,0.0,0.0,0,2,0.0,0.0037501387006799,0.9515,0.078,0.063,0.858,Positive,Very Strong

thousands of britons have signed a petition to express their outrage over queen elizabeths use of  million in taxpayers money to repair the buckingham palace 
more than  people had signed the petition as of sunday two days after the government of prime minister theresa may allowed the royal family to repair the palace with public funds 
the uk parliament should discuss the petition when it hits the  mark 
on friday the chancellor of the exchequer philip hammond granted the yearold queen a percent rise in funding required for the palaces refurbishment over the next  years 
the money would be used to replace cables pipes and boilers installed  years ago to prevent a catastrophic event that might destroy the palace according to master of the queens household tony johnstoneburt 
petitioners argued that the royals should foot the massive bill themselves given the vast extent of their wealth 
the crown and its estates should be made to fund its own renovations wrote mark johnson who posted the petition 
protesters said the money could be used to mend the faltering national health service nhs or help families get more affordable homes amid a housing crisis britains queen elizabeth ii rides a carriage with colombias president juan manuel santos after the ceremonial welcome at horse guards parade in central london november   photo by afp 
it is wholly unreasonable to cut the benefits of the sick and disabled take away housing benefits from the poor and then pay for this said one signatory of the petition 
the antimonarchy campaign group republic also took issue with the announcement denouncing it as a disgrace 
whats worse is this appalling increase is only a small part of the annual cost of the royal family which we put at m said graham smith a member of the group 
over the past years the uk government has been generous towards the royal family despite cutting billions in public money 
under former treasury minister george osborne the queens sovereign grant for  was increased by  percent bringing the total to  million a year now the annual grant would be inflated by twothirds rising to  million in

the fbi has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it 
in the wake of trumps surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country in fact there have been  reports of people being bullied by trump supporters since the election night results 
these incidents include the harassment of a muslim teacher by a student in georgia and students designating water fountains white or colored at a florida high school 
frankly there are so many incidents that its difficult to list them all you can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here  
this is what trumps america looks like and its scary and this has all happend in the course of a few days as melania trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying what exactly does she mean by that is she going to call out all bullying including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husbands own supporters or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband because right now she isnt even first lady yet and her effort has failed miserably and she only has her husband to blame",addictinginfo.org,Real,english,93.19368552397933,47.88118811881188,69,13,2019,351,4.6923076923076925,351.0,0.2152723163182744,0.5495749667938356,-0.2539352383504337,-0.227698894114549,-0.3916168945919788,-0.2214249858151103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.9935,0.05,0.164,0.786,Negative,Very Strong

my father was a highranking student radical poobah and still thinks castro is the bees knees although this makes me technically a red diaper baby i rejected all that baloney early on these days i write stories  mostly comedy science fiction  as well as maintain a blog mainly about dating advice political commentary and my writing projects november   culture 
john walker lindh grew up in the washington dc area his family brought him to california when he was ten in another ten years he would become known as the american taliban while in afghanistan he was known as sulayman alfaris one of several arabic monikers hes used over the years johnny joins the jihad there are moments when one realizes ones vacation is really starting to suck 
when he was twelve the young lindh saw spike lees rather hagiographic film biography about malcolm x that began his fascination with islam while a teenager he used the evocative email email protected and made several postings about rap music on usenet sometimes he pretended to be black even having the nerve to dis dr dre  
hort dog does hip hop no glory wack like dr dre and his madeup gangster stories sellout house nigga living honkey dory saying hes broke in his own pool doing laps all these playground mcs fall off like scabs skills disappear like alaka abracadab 
dr dres a disgrace selling out to the talcolm hell be left dead and naked in the outcome word to brother malcolm dre shirts and hats when will we see his cereal 
so whos the poseur there anyway im not sure whether to laugh at the sheer impertinence or cry at the abuse of the english language 
when he was sixteen he formally converted beginning his fateful journey meanwhile his family situation was on shaky ground his father turned gay  living parttime with his male lover  and eventually divorced 
john began his world travels twice venturing to yemen both times for nearly a year later he stayed at a pakistani madrassa in may  he went to afghanistan to fight on behalf of the taliban unfortunately for him after september  american forces went to war with the taliban he was captured on november  after his unit surrendered in kunduz 
the cia questioned him and he claimed to be an irishman that must have been an interesting conversation perhaps ach begorrah top o the mornin to ye presumably pretending to be black again wouldnt have gotten him very far shortly after the captive jihadis staged a bloody uprising  and lindh escaped hundreds died including mike spann one of his interrogators after that he was recaptured andfollowing some rough treatment not that im shedding any tears about itquestioned again he announced defiantly that he wasnt in the taliban but rather al qaeda his actions sealed his doom 
fighting for the taliban fruitcakes was a pretty dumb move on his part his actions after being captured were even dumber what could he have done differently in the beginning he couldve said he was interested in islam and his quest for discovering his spiritual roots took him abroad then he could have lied and told them he was pressganged into the taliban and he was quite happy to be freed by his countrymen 
he could have tipped off his interrogators about the planned escape attemptpotentially sparing many lives on both sidesas well as avoiding further criminal charges for himself had he given a helpful warning about the uprising likely they wouldve concluded he was small fry and let him go after that he couldve become the star of the daytime tv talk shows then he couldve given speeches on the antiwar circuit helping his jihadi buddies by saying they really arent that bad or whatever 
instead he ended up faced with ten criminal charges which couldve meant three life sentences plus ninety years finally getting smart he copped a plea for twenty years with the possibility of three off for good behavior now hes in federal prison making the news back in  by suing for the right to be allowed group prayer  what went wrong 

as bush the elder put it lindh was some misguided marin county hottubber later he apologized profusely for the remark still i have to say that bush  was onto something with that one all the criticism he got from that was because the truth hurts  
things couldve been different lindh didnt have to become a renegade if hed made other choices he could be living a happy life as a productive member of society rather than counting the days in a prison cell still his environment bears some responsibility for what he became 
he was raised in the catholic faith but a stronger grounding in itas well as explaining some of the unpleasant realities about islam to balance out the picture might have put the kibosh on his journey to jihad a liberal environment should at least be able to explain why all thats bad or has liberalism become too wishywashy to assert its own values there wasnt much chance of parental guidance turning him from the wrong path his mother converted to buddhism and his father left for the gay community 
for that matter if he had acquired an appreciation for good musicbe it mozart or metallicaperhaps he wouldnt have been so fascinated by irritating rap music what kind of white kid is so alienated from his heritage that he pretends to be black and laughably accuses dr dre of selling out on that note as for malcolm x didnt lindh have some cultural icons of his own i have to wonder if he received much grounding in his own irishamerican heritage 
all this is an illustration of what can happen when an impressionable adolescent is cast adrift in an  anything goes  environment islam speaks in absolutes enjoining right conduct and forbidding haram conduct and they fight for what they believe in i cant fault them too much for that although i disagree with their theology and actions on many points 
going further islam offers paradise for believerspromising seventy virgins to their martyrsand eternal hellfire and brimstone for the damned theres nothing wishywashy about it indeed embracing radical islam could be interpreted as an utter rejection of the anything goes world view i certainly dont agree with lindhs choices but i can see how he found that compelling in comparison to being at sea in moral relativism  
this certainly isnt the first time that people turned their backs on their countries and went abroad to give aid and comfort to the enemy jane fondas north vietnam adventure comes to mind an action she now regrets more recently there were about five hundred misguided youths who volunteered to be human shields in iraq for their pal saddam for all their posturing none of them got themselves blown up over there leaving aside the question of whether or not the resumption of war was justified  fewer social justice warriors wouldve helped cleanse the gene pool a bit 
then theres the odd case of matthew todd miller  a californian who went to north korea tore up his visa and announced he was seeking political asylum that ones an iffy case though later he said i just wanted to speak to an ordinary north korean person about normal things kids these days in summary dont let this happen to our youth they must not grow up culturally bereft 
in times past children were taught about their countrys heritage instructed in their culture and pride in their nation was instilled in them it was a given that these were presented as good things these daysat least in much of the western worldthis isnt happening we cant count on the educational systemand certainly the mediato do that any more 
because of decades of cultural marxism  young people are indoctrinated with a negative view of their own civilization all societies beliefs and ways of life are equal except yours are terrible those who dont see through that baloney end up rootless alienated and disconnected from their own culture some even end up thinking that their homeland is the embodiment of all evil while repressive regimes abroad are wonderful this is basically what social justice weenies think something they have in common with young jihadi rebels without a clue 
this will have to change of course hopefully the day will come when the media manipulators and educational bureaucrats who pushed cultural marxism are standing in the unemployment line for now well have to pay close attention to the messages that the young people in our lives are absorbing and help them learn to be secure in their faith and cultural identity teach them about their roots and why thats important dont let the tv be your childs babysitter anything goes is not a standard by which to raise our youth",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,69.75523622326341,41,5,8689,1504,4.748005319148936,1504.0,-0.6408287852880403,-0.9536307555522068,1.5107577973367063,1.5798370568290112,-0.3366487992022445,1.6283704466144209,0.0013297872340425,0.0,0.0013297872340425,0,0,0.0,0.0023547374633166,-0.6694,0.106,0.112,0.782,Negative,Strong

cnns dana bash suggested that trump should be more concerned with campaigning in swing states yet trump had three campaign stops scheduled for the same day dana bash is your dc hotel opening free advertisingdonald trump no not at all httpstcooztrfiwim httpstcohhqooomr 
 cnn politics cnnpolitics october   
so to people who say youre taking time out of swing states to go do this you say bash asked 
i say the following you have been covering me for the last  long time i did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches and ive been doing this for weeks straight trump responded 
for you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because hillary clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps and yet youll ask me that question i think thats a very rude question to be honest with you trump exclaimed 
trump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit 
while cnn has continuously run defense for hillary clinton amid a myriad of scandals and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates the network has been forced to admit that hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule

neoholographic,why isnt observer evidence like eyewitness accounts counted as evidence for ufos,link donald trump could have a disability that used to be known as aspergers and this can cause people trouble when they try to socialize because their theory of mind is not complete basically they have trouble thinking of how others perceive their actions these people tend to be highly intelligent trumps iq is  which makes sense considering he has built more businesses than most of us have and although he could have invested his fathers money and made the same amount back as he did in the end through business deals he put a lot of work and thought into his business i would like to know what kind of medicines trump is on and what his mental health diagnosis are if he has aspergers then that would explain why he makes so many social mistakes being super rich from a young age might also account for it since he would not be trained to interact with people on an equal level which is a lot more complicated than interacting with people when you are rich and they are poor however an article in the new york times recently focused on trumps fears of making social blunders he has a fear of losing social status or being embarrassed publicly however he doesnt seem to do well publicly which must be a disability because he would want to be a good public speaker and not make social gaffes yet he still does it it must be accidental donald even stated he is a difficult man to be married to which means he knows himself and his weaknesses many people with aspergers dont get married because they have a hard time in relationships,abovetopsecret.com,Fake,english,17.28658669695788,3.528806933996037,80,12,1534,282,4.439716312056738,282.0,0.5515977490921837,0.3616742515005802,-0.3822524980668149,-0.3358688686289511,-0.6408998150983497,-0.3321239319015263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,-0.3117,0.084,0.098,0.818,Negative,Moderate
iamc2,no title,"cuckservatism is a topic that has previously been discussed in detail on return of kings  in articles and comments sections alike the underlying reason that this topic is the focus of a great deal of discussion is because its roots are deeply steeped in both cowardice and betrayal
while our readership is well acquainted with the political and social implications of cuckservatism there is also a need to also discuss its behavioral roots to accomplish this task i used my social media accounts to examine connections of mine who displayed all of the classic red flags associated with cuckservatism i then searched for common traits that they possessed based on the nature of their rants or posts
the three characteristics listed below represent key factors which in my opinion are necessary for any individual to transform from an otherwise normal person into a cuck if we can understand these factors this will enable us to develop a more comprehensive strategy for rendering them irrelevant apart from merely ignoring them
political naiveté nothing screams political naivety more than voting for a last minute candidate who considers himself a conservative alternative to trump
this factor represents the first step that one must take to become a cuckservative because it entails believing in a series of premises that are patently false political naiveté can include simpler forms such as believing in the wage gap or that illegal immigrants are natural republicans conversely political naiveté can also be more complex in that an individual afflicted with it might believe in equality as a virtue or that a democratic two party system is the best form of government 
a perfect example of this can be seen in my friends and associates who blindly believe in the constitution these individuals refuse to vote for anyone other than a constitutionalist and their sole metric for judging candidates is the implications of an obscure constitutional issue that only they care about this perspective is indicative of political naiveé because the globalists who run our political system jettisoned any belief in the constitution and rule of law decades ago for them the constitution is merely a convenient rubber stamp used to justify unpopular political decisions 
accordingly anyone who votes only for candidates with such narrow viewpoints is naively playing into the hands of globalists because they fail to understand that the constitution will only function in a nation thats virtuous and willing to abide by its principles 
if the united states continues on its current demographic track we will eventually import a new population that not only despises original american values but would also actively vote to eliminate them the constitution will provide no protections if this occurs because these people will simply ignore it invoking arguably the most important phrase in all of american legal history  
to fail to understand these stakes when considering ones voting patterns instead opting to emulate the local revolutionary war reenactors is a hallmark trait of a cuckservative 
lack of self confidence a cuckservative would never get this far
lack of selfconfidence and the feelings of doubt that serve as its foundation represents a second symptom of cuckservatism which is why return of kings has countless articles on how to acquire and maintain selfconfidence as a form of preventative medicine 
doubts as to ones chances of success coupled with fear and the innate need for selfpreservation can easily shatter most people in such moments of weakness its very easy for a person to do a  and to do something that they would normally find revolting conversely if one steadfastly believes in their convictions and themselves their selfconfidence will become stronger this is true even in situations when seemingly the entire world is against them 
the following clip is from an interview that jeb bush did with lester holt during the republican primary and is an excellent illustration of how a lack of selfconfidence can lead to powerlessness and a lack of control over ones surroundings 

from the very beginning of this clip jebs lack of self confidence is readily apparent whether it was the fact that he was too far hunched over in his seat his attempts to curb his nervousness by forcing himself to smile or laugh or the fact that he rarely made eye contact with lester holt any ability that he has to project himself was undermined by his body language
an even deeper sign of his lack of selfconfidence begins at  in the video when holt proceeds to ask him why he didnt frame the charleston shooting as an act of racism in this situation if asked such a question in any setting an individual has one of two choices if he is selfconfident he would turn the question back on lester holt by saying that racism is a social construct and the only people who care about it are limpwristed losers
however if one is like jeb and lacks selfconfidence their response to this situation will be to immediately try to compromise by acknowledging the premise raised by someone like lester holt and then spend the rest of the interview trying to show that theyre not a bad person this was the approach that jeb used and it demonstrated to lester holt that he was weak which then led to lester forcing jeb to backtrack and question his own decision to support stand your ground laws during his tenure as floridas governor
a lack of selfconfidence as evidenced by jebs failure to retain control over his surroundings during his interview with lester holt highlights a classic character trait shared by cuckservatives the only answer that i can come up with as to why this trait is so prevalent is that it might be a product of their childhood that they havent been able to get over
in a way the archetypal cuck was likely bullied or mistreated as a child but has never learned how to fight back or to love being hated by others because of this they never developed the necessary level of selfconfidence to succeed in life which eventually translates over to their politics
they want to be friends with everyone how to destroy a political movement established by ones father in one fell swoop
having grown up in the leftist northeast and considering that i still live and work there im used to being in the political minority my coping mechanisms for this situation consisted of unknowingly embracing key tenets of the alternative right and knowing how to pick my political fights additionally i also resolved to never be friendly with or ever trust anyone from the political left a decision that has been vindicated over the last several years 
unfortunately my approach is not a popular one amongst political dissidents in my region this is because many of them having grown up with leftists simply view their political disagreements as a series of gentlemanly differences that they can put aside over a few beers they refuse to believe that leftists and sjws hate anyone who even slightly disagrees with them and like women view weak men as easy targets 
accordingly when faced with the choice of staying true to their beliefs or moderating them in order to ensure that they get invited to the next sushi night art showing or paint nite the cuckservatives that i know will roll over every time specifically theyll profess support for third party libertarian or constitutional candidates while supporting a slightly lessliberal version of their leftist friends politics 
this tendency demonstrates a key principle that most cuckservatives subconsciously hold they want to be liked by everyone and will therefore do anything they can to make this happen even if it means betraying themselves and their own beliefs in the process when does adopting this attitude ever lead to success in life 
if a child keeps getting beat up by a schoolyard bully should they cower in the bullys presence and act as his lackey in order to avoid getting hurt we all know that such an approach is worthless and that the only way to respond is to fight back yet these people adopt the same approach when dealing with the political equivalent of a schoolyard bully perhaps their reason for trying to be friends with globalists and trying to appease them by being moderate stems from the way in which they handled problems in childhood however that issue itself is another topic that deserves discussion by itself 
is there a remedy for these character flaws even if we understand these characteristics and can think of active ways to subvert cuckservatism we will not be entirely successful most people who fall under this category have been psychologically conditioned to act this way meaning that much of our attempts to open their eyes will fall on deaf ears i have no sympathy for these people because theyve never had the internal drive or fortitude necessary to overcome adversity and would rather wallow in misery while also pulling others into the abyss with them 
however there are always a couple that might show potential these individuals might only be seen by us as cuckservatives because they imitated others around them while lacking a positive role model that could show them the truth the greatest service we can do for these select few is to identify them and prove that there is a viable alternative 
if  cents a day can supposedly help a starving african family have rice for six months then us acting as positive role models to our weaker brethren will help them immeasurably while also advancing our own cause

Humberto Fontova,hillarys castro endorsement,"nigerian novelist wonders why everyone loves hillary november   daniel greenfield 
why does everyone love hillary clinton its hard to say her unfavorable ratings have hit  that makes her more popular than 
 the bubonic plague 
 obamacare 
 osama bin ladens corpse 
its not much to go on but the atlantic decided to run a piece by chimamanda adichie titledwhy is hillary clinton so widely loved 
your response to seeing the name chimamanda adichie was probably huh unless youre a gender studies student at an ivy in which case you know exactly who she is and love her chimamanda adichie is a nigerian novelist whose we should all be feminists is big in those circles 
the clinton campaign is unbearably awkward and this panegyric by adichie was an obvious attempt to channel some of that canned obama poetry and like most hillary branding it fails badly 
there are howlers like there are millions who admire the tapestry of hillary clintons past and there are people who when hillary clinton becomes the first woman to be president of the united states will weep from joy its not quite a hymn to comrade stalin nor is it getting there by any means except a tow truck 
and then theres the phrasing oh the phrasing hillary clinton was guilty immediately when she stepped into the view of the american public as the first lady of arkansas 
this is an awkward attempt to channel that obama poetry but instead it reads like a dvd manual badly translated from the japanese 
the atlantic piece is full of lines that straddle the border between tineared propagandistic cliche and just bad writing 
she was a lawyer full of dreams 
she was guilty of not being a traditional first lady she offended the old patriarchal order 
then theres the theme of the article which is to just deny reality 
a conservative writer labeled her a congenital liar when she was first lady and the label stuck because it was repeated over and overand it was a convenient label to harness misogyny if she was a liar then the hostility she engendered could not possibly be because she was a first lady who refused to be still and silent liar has reemerged during this election even though politifact a respected source of information about politicians has certified that she is more honest than most politicians 
the perfect timing for that defense would have been not right after hillary clinton shouted at a rally that she had been in new york on  but dont worry hillary is more honest than most politicians a site supporting her said so 
 other words have been repeated over and over with no context until they have begun to breathe and thrum with life especially emails the press coverage of emails has become an unclear morass where emails must mean something terrible if only because of how often it is invoked 
how about classified emails or illegal server or violation of regulations dealing with the handling of classified material thats got lots of context or coverup 
the people who love hillary clinton know that the it system at the state department is old and stodgy nothing like a blackberrys smooth whirl hillary clinton was used to her blackberry and wanted to keep using it when she became secretary of state 
people who love hillary know that she love high tech blackberry hillary love blackberry she is a lawyer full of dreams who fights for the children of migrant workers and loves their smooth whirl politifact thrums with life says her blackberry is more honest than the iphone hillary has many dreams of thrumming blackberries whirling smoothly that offend the traditional stodgy patriarchal order it system 
the american conservative media saw an opportunity to blow the emails story out of proportion soon followed almost bashfully by the rest of the american media 
is that how it works in nigeria because thats not how it works in america 
there is no objective basis on which to equate hillary clinton to her opponent 
theyre both mammals they need oxygen to live theyre better writers than chimamanda adichie 
the people who love hillary clinton see the failings of the general american media where news entertains rather than informs they bristle when benign stories about her are covered with an ominous tone 
they bristle and they hug their blackberry and weep for they fear that the patriarchal stodgy it systems will prevent hillary from being the thrumming first lady of north america 
they know that she is a bit too careful but they understand that she has to be that she cannot afford spontaneity 
you would think with all those six figure speeches she could afford a little 
her actions so falsely magnified that she leaned into caution wrapped herself in a kind of caution that sometimes makes her appear stilted  
and wrapped in her caution her whirling blackberry in one hand she bristled at the public retracting her quills and occasionally hissing in an informed fashion for the children of migrant workers who admired the tapestry of her past 
there are millions of americans who do not have the selfindulgent expectation that a politician be perfect they are frustrated that hillary clinton is allowed no complexity

Activist Post,smart meter case testimony before the pennsylvania public utility commission what no one wants to acknowledge about emf damage part  of,"by joseph jankowski 
an organization which has the aim to separate the state of california from the union of the united states is set to hold a meeting at the state capitol in sacramento on wednesday november   the day after the presidential election 
the yes california independence campaign  which is based in san diego describes itself as a nonviolent campaign to establish the country of california using any and all legal and constitutional means to do so 
the group is currently trying to qualify a citizens initiative in  to get a referendum for secession on the ballot in  reports sf gate  they will be in sacramento in hopes to gather support for the states exit or the calexit as they call it 
in our view the united states of america represents so many things that conflict with californian values and our continued statehood means california will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment and to the detriment of our children reads yes california s official website 
the groups page reads on 
although charity is part of our culture when you consider that californias infrastructure is falling apart our public schools are ranked among the worst in the entire country we have the highest number of homeless persons living without shelter and other basic necessities poverty rates remain high income inequality continues to expand and we must often borrow money from the future to provide services for today now is not the time for charity however this independence referendum is about more than california subsidizing other states of this country it is about the right to selfdetermination and the concept of voluntary association both of which are supported by constitutional and international law
it is about california taking its place in the world standing as an equal among nations we believe in two fundamental truths  california exerts a positive influence on the rest of the world and  california could do more good as an independent country than it is able to do as a just a us state 
yes california s website lays out  different points covering topics the group believes will benefit from a california exit from the us including education peace and security debt and taxes and immigration 
one blog post on their page draws parallels with a calexit and the recent referendum known as brexit that passed in the uk in june which showed that most british people are ready for their country to leave the eu 
the push for secession is nothing new to california in  the mayor of port orford oregon gilbert gable proposed the idea to push the oregon counties of curry josephine jackson and klamath to join with the california counties of del norte siskiyou and modoc to form a new state later named jefferson 
modoc county of northern california voted in  to join neighboring siskiyou county in a push to secede from the state of california  
in  two counties in northern california petitioned for the right to form a st state of america which they also wanted to name jefferson

Gillian,the chronovisor a device used to look into the future and past,"cyrus mistry joins aap tata sons shortlists candidates for chairmans post posted on tweet image via intodayin 
ousted chairman of tata sons cyrus mistry today joined the aam aadmi party speaking to the media cyrus mistry said the media government regulators or politicians no one is supporting me in fighting against the injustice i have faced kejriwalji is my only hope so i joined the aap 
speaking at the occasion aap supremo and delhi cm arvind kejriwal said having worked at tata steel several years ago i have firsthand experience of how the board of directors of tata sons did not allow me to work that is the reason i quit tata steel 
just like cyrus mistry i also took up the top job in delhi because there were no other suitable candidate i empathize with cyrus mistry when he says that ratan tata did not allow him to do work in a similar way narendra modi and najeeb jung do not allow me to do work in delhi he added 
why should someone be fired for choosing to close loss making uk steel business first take care of indians before subsidizing british citizens ratan tata is a british agent even aap does not fire its leaders so fast he declared 
meanwhile our correspondent overheard this discussion between cyrus mistry and rajdeep sardesai 
rajdeep sardesai so what i understand mr mistry is that you are concerned about the rising intolerance by the majority against the minorities in india 
cyrus mistry no i only said that i am concerned about the rising intolerance of the majority shareholders in tata sons against minority shareholders like me 
meanwhile aap leader ashutosh took to twitter to blast tata sons 
as per cyrus mistry tata motors nano plant in gujarat is making losses even industrialists in gujarat are losing money is this the gujarat model will modi answer he tweeted 
cyrus mistry spoke about risk of impairment in tata steal will ratan tata answer read his second tweet 
why was cyrus mistry not given a free hand to run tata suns will the bored answer said his third tweet 
a source who did not wish to be identified told our correspondent that tata sons is also planning to fire cyrus mistry from the board of directors and has already found his replacement 
after ratan tata asked for a versatile candidate with expertise in several fields and who is not afraid to speak his mind a consultant suggested the name of justice katju but ratan tata was not pleased at the prospect of being called an idiot in a board meeting and so vetoed the proposal instead congress leader ahmed patel will be filling this post 
according to our source the tata sons board was very impressed with ahmed patel after he told them that rather than abrupt firing they should have kept planting stories in the media like ratan tata unhappy with cyrus mistrys decision to close down tata steel uk business 
this along with his ability to effectively manage a family trust and also manage a professional ceo without letting him drift from the groups ethos and culture earned him a board seat 
further according to our source several names came up during the latest board meeting to pick a new chairman ahmed patel suggested the name of dr manmohan singh but ratan tata vetoed it saying he wanted a person who could be a brand ambassador for the tata group 
currently there are  persons who are frontrunners in the race for chairman one is arvind kejriwal several board members think that he will be a suitable candidate because he can just give speeches visit offices and be a brand ambassador while the actual work could be left to the board 
another name doing the round is chetan bhagat given his iit iim qualifications along with his versatile persona of being an author columnist screenwriter television personality and motivational speaker several board members think he is the perfect candidate for the heavily diversified salt to software conglomerate further he is good with numbers an area the tata group is struggling at this point in time",shiftfrequency.com,Fake,english,10.768545006442226,7.981665512530776,62,12,3966,691,4.713458755426918,691.0,0.0012470409166957,0.3616742515005802,0.2611858022017195,0.3053125745071426,-0.3707428695918518,0.3240480818570844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.8259,0.07,0.068,0.862,Positive,Very Strong
Reuters,clinton campaign urges fbi to detail new developments in email case,"interviews the fbi probe was inevitable because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the clinton foundation had most specifically and grievously to saudi arabia to qatar says american analyst scott bennett 
the ongoing federal investigation into the clinton foundation was expected because of the clinton familys ties with us enemies says scott bennett a former us army psychological warfare officer 
the fbi has been probing possible paytoplay schemes at the family foundation for over a year now and is likely to press charges against it fox news reported wednesday citing informed officials 
bennett told press tv on friday that the probe was inevitable because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the clinton foundation had most specifically and grievously to saudi arabia to qatar and many other countries blacklisted by washington 
it was revealed on friday that the clinton foundation took a  million gift from qatar during hillary clintons tenure as the us secretary of state without her informing the state department 
hillary decided to not inform the department of the transaction despite signing an ethics agreement with regards to the foundation when she became secretary of state 
according to the foundations website qatar has so far given the clintons a total of between  million and  million over the years 
aside from qatar saudi arabia has also been one of the clinton foundations biggest donors it became known in  that the kingdom had given them between  million and  million 
so those terrorist entities which have been labeled as the enemies of the united states have been appearing as clinton foundation donors bennett said 
that is a serious crime it is treason it is corruption it is bribery of officials said the analyst 
bennett argued that all the leaks and investigations concerning the clinton family were coming from those personnel in the american government who have had enough

Daniel Greenfield,obama used religious test to favor muslims over christians,"reprinted from spectatororg  
tom hayden the vietnam war protester and sds founder died this past weekend at age  
haydens journey was in many ways tragic born december  in the detroit suburbs he was not unlike many radical leaders a reddiaper baby his parents were irish catholics who named him after st thomas aquinas and sent him to catholic school his father was a marine who worked for chrysler and an abusive drunk haydens parents had a rocky marriage and divorced when he was a boy which affected him terribly haydens friend and exradical david horowitz observed that hayden harbored what irving howe once described as an obscure personal rage possibly from his estrangement from his father tom was indeed an angry man wrote horowitz who seemed in perpetual search of enemies 
hayden channeled that anger into a group that did much damage to america and was the antithesis of anything that thomas aquinas would have ever imagined sds students for a democratic society 
hayden will be forever young and forever a hippie in the memories of many americans the snarling activist who married hanoi jane fonda and literally wrote the script for sds hayden wrote sdss manifesto its founding port huron statement which haydens creampuff obituary in the washington post generously referred to as an expansive utopian manifesto that extolled participatory democracy as an antidote to the complacency and conformity of the eisenhower decade 
right 
haydens odd expressions of participatory democracy included another writing he scribbled an infamous june   letter wishing good fortune and victory to the north vietnamese colonels who were killing american boys in southeast asia  using the same kind of artillery that haydens sweetheart jane posed beside in her stint as a viet cong covergirl that was just one of countless disturbing actions by tom hayden at the time all of which todays leftists merrily sweep under the rug as they uphold him as a crusader for civil rights and of course social justice 
but not etched in our memory was what might have been tom haydens swan song long after his and his wifes cheerleading for the viet cong namely the document that he wrote for our president of fundamental transformation few know this but hayden was a founder of another group of destructive forces a group called progressives for obama 
the groups members came together in  coalescing around the only democratic presidential nominee in their lifetimes who was farleft enough for them to support they constituted a whos who of the s sds crowd among the nearly  formal signers to progressives for obama were mark rudd carl davidson jane fonda thorne dreyer daniel ellsberg richard flacks john mcauliff jay schaffner and more columbia university was naturally wellrepresented if not through the likes of rudd who shut down the campus in  then through current faculty such as todd gitlin a former sds president who today is professor of journalism sociology and chair of columbias doctoral program in communications 
whereas the likes of obama friends bill ayers and bernardine dohrn were thrust into the national spotlight in  by conservatives like glenn beck and sean hannity progressives for obama flew under the radar largely unnoticed even by the right 
appropriately spearheading progressives for obama was the man who had spearheaded sds tom hayden was one of the four initiators of progressives for obama along with barbara ehrenreich bill fletcher jr and danny glover 
it is no exaggeration to say that the signers list of progressives for obama resembled the roster of sdsers called to testify before congress in december  for their subversive activities aside from the likes of hayden rudd and davidson other sdsers among progressives for obama were bob pardun who was sds education secretary from  and paul buhle a professor who has recently sought to revive sds 
among these names from the insane s all were fired up in  over the unique opportunity that a fellow farleft radical one barack obama offered they saw obama as a golden chance a onceinalifetime moment and they got it on november   obama won the day and they at last won the day too 
and therein among the progressives for obama the testimony of leader tom hayden was especially revealing 
understand that after his early life establishing sds meeting with and expressing good fortune and victory to the viet cong and vigorously protesting the american system hayden went into politics professional activism and education like his erstwhile sds brethren hayden grasped the power of higher education which they have pervaded and served as a professor at pitzer college and also at obamas alma mater occidental college 
like mark rudd like bill ayers like bernardine dohrn all of them now in higher education hayden had come to view a quick revolution of the system as too daunting if not impossible he had become much more patient instead advocating a progressive evolution of slower measured change  by  he was seeking to advance the progressive cause within the established mainstream democratic party 
of course hayden once helped blow up the democratic partys national convention in  no matter the party of  was different and warmly accepted him 
hayden was ecstatic over barack obamas presidential campaign he jumped in with both feet looking to assist wherever he could with a rush of enthusiasm not seen since his days undermining america in vietnam not one to tinker around hayden got to work on a formal organization and unifying statement as he had done for sds  once again there at the creation the man who drafted sdss pivotal port huron statement got to work drafting mission statements for progressives for obama 
during the  campaign a touched hayden was moved to verse over the emergence of obama in one article titled obama and the open and unexpected future written for commondreamsorg selfdescribed as a website for breaking news  views for the progressive community hayden mused 
i didnt see him coming when i read of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president i was at least sentient enough to be interested when i read dreams of my father sic i was taken aback by its depth this young man apparently gave his first public speech against south african apartheid at an occidental college rally organized by students for economic democracy the student branch of the campaign for economic democracy which i chaired in  the buds of curiosity quickened 
hayden saw in obama a longawaited vehicle for economic democracy an instrument to channel an equal distribution of wealth  economic justice or redistributive change as obama himself had once put it hayden wished that win or lose the obama movement will shape progressive politics for a generation to come he also hoped that that progressive movement likewise might transform obama as well both could reinforce and shape one another 
hayden wrote that in june  when obama was elected later the following november hayden was beside himself with joy surely shocked that the american electorate had finally voted for a president that tom hayden saw as his kind of president once upon a time traditional democrats like haydens parents had shaken their heads in disgust at what tom and his pals did to their partys convention in chicago in  at what they did during the days of rage the next year at what they did at columbia during the student strike and on and on but now by  the democratic party was theirs it belonged to the s kiddies 
the former sds founder became particularly vocal in his praise for obama once the election was over during the election the goal was to organize raise money but not speak too loudly out of fear of driving away the moderates and remaining traditional democrat moms and pops who had worked in the mines and the mills who joined unions who clinged to their god and guns who prayed rosaries and filled churches who were prolife and antigay marriage with the presidency now secured hayden could open up joined by his former comrades at the takenoprisoners website of progressives for obama he began regularly sounding off against obamas critics  those opposing single payer or the public option in healthcare reform or government management of general motors  with the subtlety of a howitzer 
with the presidency won hayden and his allies were free to express themselves to demonize healthinsurance companies the financialservices industry aig the big three automakers or whatever other capitalist reptile lenins phrase stood in the way of president obamas desire for reform and mandate for change 
in the twoterm presidency of fundamental transformation under obama hayden and friends achieved many of their common dreams 
by this election cycle in  tom hayden must have been mesmerized by the revolution he and his fellow radicals had pulled off in the democratic party 
alas it was fitting that tom hayden became seriously ill his final stand during a turn for the worse at the democratic national convention in philadelphia this past summer where he was striving to ensure that the democratic party continue along the radical path of fundamental transformation that he and his allies had been unable to achieve via sds and the weather underground that path in the hands of hillary clinton is assured 
today at long last for tom hayden and friends the new democratic party and the new america is theirs he can rest in peace assured that his mission is finally being accomplished",frontpagemag.com,Real,english,99.2,90.02057418254917,58,9,9498,1571,5.0101845957988544,1571.0,-0.1210531164556349,-0.2020278943791856,1.7247962779770205,1.6848716697632855,-0.0779035652413465,1.7358607275968825,0.0019096117122851,0.0,0.0006365372374283,0,1,0.0,0.0036650576924295,0.9985,0.115,0.063,0.823,Positive,Very Strong
Ryan Banister,att secret spy program unveiled project hemisphere,"posted by claire bernish 
tony podesta  brother of the nowdisgraced hillary clinton campaign chair john podesta  whose files wikileaks has been publishing  is not only a powerful democratic party lobbyist but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of saudi arabia 
no  as tinfoilhat conspiracy theorist as it might sound  that scenario is the absolute truth 
in  john and tony podesta formed the podesta group and have used their bigwig partyinsider status to lobby and influence government policies  while at various times simultaneously holding positions of power  which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest 
according to the march  filing made in accordance with the foreign agents registration act of  tony podesta is an active foreign agent of the saudi government with the  center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court  and acts as an officer of the saudi arabia account 
at this point the web of payforplay between the washington political heavyweights and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight 
for starters the podesta brothers lobbying firm receives  every month from the saudi government which in no uncertain terms  and despite a status as privileged us ally  wages a bloody campaign of censorship murder suppression human rights abuse and worse against its civilian population while bombing hospitals schools and aid convoys in neighboring nations 
john podesta previously served as president bill clintons chief of staff founded the think tank center for american progress which ohsocoincidentally touts the need to reframe saudi arabias hopelessly tarnished image counseled president obama and now chairs hillary clintons campaign 
tony podesta acts as a foreign agent for the kingdom of saudi arabia  lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the kingdom  while also contributing to and bundling for hillary clintons campaign 
think about that for a moment 
one brother uses the influence of money to both affect united states foreign policy and infuse the clinton campaign with cash  while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities 
as the washington post reported months ago in july tony podestas lobbying efforts raised  for the campaign and  for the victory fund 
the saudis hired the podesta group in  because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home including sentencing blogger raif badawi to ten years in prison and  lashes for insulting islam alternet reported  since then tony podestas fingerprints have been all over saudi arabias advocacy efforts in washington dc when saudi arabia executed the prominent nonviolent shia dissident sheikh nimr alnimr causing protests throughout the shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions the new york times noted that the podesta group provided the newspaper with a saudi commentator who defended the execution 
notably the saudis reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up  concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year but suspiciously reckless and errant usbacked coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict 
additionally tony podestas status as a registered foreign agent for saudi arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from april    ironically revealed by wikileaks publishing of his brothers personal communiques  in which former clinton foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director dennis cheng wrote to a small group of insiders 
hi all  we do need to make a decision on this asap as our friends who happen to be registered with fara foreign agents registration act are already donating and raising 
i do want to push back a bit its my job i feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table both for primary and general and then dnc and state parties and how do we explain to people that well take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them that the foundation takes  from foreign govts but we now wont either way we need to make a decision soon 
to which general counsel to the clinton campaign attorney marc elias replied all errors original and emphasis added 
responding to all on this i was not on the call this morning but i lean away from a bright line rule here it seems odd to say that someone who represents alberta canada cant give but a lobbyist for phillip morris can just as we vet lobbyists case by case i would do the same with fara while this may lead to a large number of fara registrants being denied it would not be a flat our ban a total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eyerolling and ill will that it did for obama 
as the exchange continues how to precisely handle the campaigns image with potentially controversial donors  while at all costs maintaining the flow of cash  becomes even more apparent as strategist and campaign manager robby mook responds 
where do we draw the line though 
elias suggests a particularly intricate solution 
if we do it case by case then it will be subjective we would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for in judging whether to take the money we would consider the relationship between that country and the united states its relationship to the state department during hillarys time as secretary and its relationship if any to the foundation in judging the individual we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and hillarys past campaigns specifically 
put simply we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists except with a somewhat more stringent screen 
as a legal matter i am not saying we have to do this  we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely im just offering this up as a middle ground 
mook eventually decides plainly 
marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions dont really get you anythingthat obama actually got judged more harshly as a result he convinced me soin a complete uturn im ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks are you guys ok with that 
all of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect  despite increasing calls for the united states to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody saudi regime  the us approved a stunning  billion sale of smart bombs to the kingdom in november  
tony podestas specific contract with the governmentrun center for studies and media affairs at the saudi royal court which will earn  million by years end does indeed suggest the infusion of a prosaudi message into the us media propaganda machine 
saudi arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in washington sunlight foundation spokesman josh stewart told the washington post  that spans both what youd call the inside game which is lobbying and government relations and the outside game which is pr and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying 
that broader audience  the american public  has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughlycorrupt clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the saudis as well 
as the free thought project has repeatedly reported  the evidence of collusion among the democratic national committee hillary clintons campaign and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable  including no less than  socalled journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign 
although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet and yet at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the white house  who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts

north koreas foreign ministry slammed the shamelessness of israel on friday calling the jewish state a rogue group that poses a nuclear threat and commits terrorist attacks against neighboring countries on friday the korean central news agency released a statement attributed to north koreas foreign ministry that responded to comments israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu made last week that were critical of the hermit kingdom this is an unpardonable insult and provocation to the dignity and social system in the dprk and the choice made by its people the statement said of netanyahus comments referring to north korea by its official name the democratic peoples republic of korea the statement then took issue with israels foreign policy in the middle east stating israel not only represents dictatorial forces for aggression that trample down the legitimate right of the palestinian people and indiscriminately kill them but also is a rogue group that poses a nuclear threat and makes terrorist attacks on its neighboring countries with lots of nuclear weapons the statement was responding to comments netanyahu made during a press conference with japanese prime minister shinzo abe last week in which the israeli leader repeatedly drew parallels between iran and north korea and prime minister abe we have something else in common netanyahu began we are two peace loving democracies that face formidable threats from nearby rogue states both iran and north korea are governed by ruthless and extreme dictatorships states that seek to bully and intimidate their neighbors and in our case to actually eradicate us from the face of the earth noting that iran and north korea have aggressive military nuclear programs netanyahu repeated his plea to not allow iran to use diplomacy to advance its nuclear program as he alleges north korea did with the  agreed framework iran cannot be allowed to travel the road taken by north korea its not the first time that north korea has slammed israel or even netanyahu publicly after netanyahu criticized pyongyang during a trip to japan last year the north korean foreign ministry released a similar statement which called israel a cancer to peace in the middle east it also accused netanyahu of trying to use north korea to divert international criticism of israel caused by its settlement activity and breakdown in the middle east peace talks similarly in last weeks statement north koreas foreign ministry said everybody knows about the shamelessness of israel telling lies and making fabrications and pointing accusing fingers to others to justify its criminal acts and evade the censure and condemnation by the international community besides trading public insults israel has long been concerned about north koreas support for arab states that are hostile to israel as well as iran in fact during the  yom kippur war north korea actually deployed a squadron of migs to egypt which engaged in a firefight with israeli fs neither side sustained any damage more recently north korea has been accused of proliferating ballistic missiles and nuclear technology to syria and iran in  israel destroyed syrias al kibar nuclear reactor that was reportedly built by north korean engineers",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,49,6,3239,519,5.235067437379576,519.0,-0.396228470543379,-0.7657300402589515,0.0688421984619067,0.0356714786161691,0.1440337449919541,0.0481028829170329,0.0057803468208092,0.0,0.001926782273603,0,2,0.0,0.0129570246551298,-0.9972,0.057,0.178,0.765,Negative,Very Strong
Alex Ansary,half of russians fear syria could spark ww,"russias most potent weapon hoarding gold  
shtfplancom 
this article was written by jay syrmopoulos and originally published at the free thought project  
editors comment he who holds the gold makes the rules fresh attempts at containing russia and continuing the empire have been met with countermoves russia appears to be building strength in every way putin and his country have no intention of being under the american thumb and are developing rapid resistance as the us petrodollar loses its grip and china russia and the east shift into new currencies and shifting world order 
what lies ahead it will be a strong hand for the countries that have the most significant backing in gold and hard assets and china and russia have positioned themselves very well prepare for a changing economic landscape and one in which selfreliance might be all we have 
russia is hoarding gold at an alarming rate  the next world war will be fought with currencies 
by jay syrmopoulos 
with all eyes on russias unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile icbm which nato has dubbed the satan missile  as tensions with the us increase moscows most potent weapon may be something drastically different 
the rapidly evolving geopolitical weapon brandished by russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold as well as russias native currency the ruble 
take a look at the symbol below as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order  potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift  and much sooner than you might think 
image httpthefreethoughtprojectcomwpcontentuploadsbankofrussiaepng 
the symbol is the new designation of the russian ruble russias national currency 
similar to how the us uses the dollar sign  the uk uses the pound sign  and the european union uses the euro symbol  russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally 
after the failed reset in usrussian relations by the obama administration and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship washington began targeting entire sectors of the russian economy as well as specific individuals meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force moscow into compliance 
instead of decimating russia what it precipitated was a russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the us petrodollar and working with china to create an alternative to the swift payment system that isnt solely controlled by western interests see asian infrastructure investment bank  new development bank 
according to the corbett report  
new reports indicate that china is ready to launch its swift alternative and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of dedollarization that is seeing the bricsled resistance bloc breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the usled washington consensus 
for those who dont know swift stands for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication and is shorthand for the swiftnet network that is used by over  financial institutions in  countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world swift does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions still given the systems near universality in the financial system it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the swift network 
this is why delisting from the swift network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the us and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns 
recently financial guru jim rickards author of the book currency wars wrote that russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy russian bonds and stocks and the russian currency the ruble will all benefit rickards believes a strong turnaround is coming within russia and that this comeback will benefit the ruble 
while still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the us russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar there remains a clear and present danger of the russian economy being devastated by the whims of washington 
the bank of russia that nations central bank is extremely clear about its mission and monetary policy declaring on its website 
monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing wellbeing of russian citizens the bank of russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflationtargeting regime and sees price stability albeit sustainably low inflation as its priority given structural peculiarities of the russian economy the target is to reduce inflation to  by  and maintain it within that range in the medium run 
in laymans terms that means that monetary policy similar to nuclear weapons and the military are an integral part of the state policy in russia while many analysts have noted the increased buildup in russias military arsenal seemingly few have highlighted the massive buildup of russian gold reserves over the past decade 
below is a chart showing russian gold reserves between  and last year  
since  there has been a yearonyear increase that reveals a significant upward trend the chart clearly reveals that russias state policy of increasing state monetary assets in the form of gold additionally the russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets from  to  russias state holdings of gold tripled 
within just the past year russia has substantially increased its gold holdings 
according to the business insider  
in july of this year the central bank of russia added  ounces of gold to its reserves the onemonth uptick in russian gold reserves   ounces  is approximately equal to the entire annual output of barrick golds turquoise ridge gold mine in nevada 
at that same rate   ounces per month  in a mere five months russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of barricks massive goldstrike mine in nevada 
currently russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world its clear that there is a concerted effort by russian authorities to build up the countrys gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the united states 
rickards in his  book currency wars theorized that russia and china could combine their gold reserves to form a global goldbacked currency to compete against the us dollar currently russian reserves stand at roughly  tonnes with chinese reserves totaling over  tonnes according to china  its likely more which would amount to a combined total of roughly  tonnes of gold 
the us is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the international monetary fund imf thus the us lockup on global gold is about to vanish according to business insider 
imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that russianchinese alliance could exercise indirect or even direct control over the imfs gold reserve of over  tonnes russian chinese and imf gold combined would equal roughly  tonnes and would allow for direct competition with the us gold reserves estimated at  tonnes 
russia and china have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by washington as its weapon of choice when opposing a wellarmed state and clearly see the writing on the wall  thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm 
the reality is that the united states is  trillion dollars in debt and eventually the time will come when the us economy begins to implode  and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper its printed on hard assets such as gold and silver should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the us using the petrodollar as a weapon 
ultimately the united states russia and china are all controlled by centralized powerhungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the imf the world bank swift new development bank and the asian infrastructure investment bank 
its not russian nuclear weapons that people should fear as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a firststrike nuclear attack the true threat to america is our economic house of cards built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the rights of corporations over that of people

as radicalism and hatred continue to empty their venom onto the world sowing discord enmity and selfrighteous arrogance a group of shia muslim entrepreneurs from iran saudi arabia pakistan iraq and the us imagined a technology which would speak unity amid furious sectarianism and cohesion where there was distrust
keen not only denounce but oppose the ideological abomination which is wahhabism  this dogma the house of saud rose atop the fanaticism of one heretic scholar muhammad ibn abdelwahhab th century muslims have chosen to anchor their rebuttal of extremism through the promotion of a new media platform messenger 
will likely argue that another social media platform is hardly revolutionary  especially if we consider how many apps are already available this one particular product defiantly taps into a religious movement and expression wahhabist saudi arabia has worked to silence
what in the world am i talking about
i am referring to resistance  more particularly social resistance through the affirmation of islams most sacred and universal principle justice
more why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity shia muslims gather in dc for antiterror rally letting freedom ring how islams universal message continues to speak through imam husayn ibn ali if islam has often been portrayed as the religion of peace i would personally argue that islam promotes in fact justice  this innate yearning we all share beyond the many labels we have chosen for ourselves at the heart of most
it is our refusal to bow to tyranny and accept oppression which prompted communities of man to rise against the establishment and from the ashes of empires dream themselves free
today such principles have been packaged into an app  several lines of coding put together to defy saudi arabias radical construct a tool to break free from the shackles of religious oppression
who said technology could not be revolutionary
here is where messenger  really promises to break the social sound barrier  beyond a simple exercise in technological entrepreneurship and an imperious need to reject theofascism messenger  carries the very essence of islams tradition in it name arbaeen
arbaeen means  in arabic a reference to the mourning of imam hussain ibn ali the grandson of the prophet muhammad and third imam of islam
a symbol of fortitude courage and exceptional piety imam hussains name has long echoed of islams most brilliant principles  that before tyranny none should relent that even in the most suffocating of darkness it is truth which must be spoken beyond selfinterest and beyond all fears
it is those principles messenger  ambition to promote by speaking freedom in a region locked in oppression  all thanks to saudi arabias desire to project hatred onto a faith it has proclaimed ownership over
should you have missed the momentous act of resistance this one app represents i would like to remind you that saudi arabia still forbids women to drive  that and a few other wonderful vapid social restrictions in a region where being a religious minority often equates to a death sentence thinking freedom is a revolutionary act  never mind speaking tolerance and acceptance
with less than a fortnight to go before arbaeen just as millions are making their way to karbala to remember the martyrdom of their imam he who was claimed by the forefather of terror yazid ibn muawiyah messenger  is preparing its grand launch
haidar attouq a member of the board of developers who refers to himself as a saudi citizen explained how messenger  aims to reform the way muslims think communication by fostering tolerance and peaceful exchange

every four years americans are given the illusion of choice between oligarchs andor aspiring oligarchs who will serve the interests of oligarchy candidates who aspire to actually represent the interests of the people are marginalized by the corporate media and the paytoplay campaign contributions of the oligarchs
in municipal and county elections and ballot measures americans often do have real choices but the higher and more powerful the office the greater the corruption and oligarchic control nevertheless only a small minority of americans actually vote n local elections the atlantics citylab reporting project recently concluded that fewer than  vote in mayoral elections in  of the  most populous cites disengagement is one of the most fundamental facts of american political life
regarding federal elections this concept of democracy within the largest most lethal military power the world has ever seen is bogus to begin with when us citizens cast ballots to elect a new commanderinchief who will continue the project of perpetual war military industrial profits and global hegemony how democratic is that the vast majority of those who will suffer and die dont get to vote the only exceptions are members of the us armed services who die in us wars if those on the other side of the pentagons crosshairs were able to vote im sure they would elect our green party presidential candidate jill stein who said we say to trump we dont need no friggin wall we just need to stop invading other countries her running mate vice presidential candidate ajamu baraka has called the humanitarian interventionist argument a new version of the white mans burden and said you have to ask yourself when was the last time the us has been on the side of the people and the answer is never
more top aide to hillary clinton urges the fbi to disclose what it knows about trumps russia ties what will hillary clinton do for india not much and heres why clintons policies look like a death sentence for americans  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency how do you explain the dynastic governance clinton is the american dream in all its glory
im not sure i can explain the clinton dynasty except to agree that it is one chelsea has been very involved in the clinton foundation and is quite likely to enter political life and even run for president one day we have had other political dynasties most notably the roosevelts the kennedys and the bushes and there are many lower level dynasties like the browns in california jerry brown the current governor of california is the son of former california governor pat brown new york state has the cuomos governor andrew cuomo is the son of former governor mario cuomo and his brother chris cuomo is a prominent corporate television host
regarding the american dream i assume youre referring to the dream that if you work hard and play by the rules you can achieve some proportionate degree of status security and prosperity if so the clintons certainly arent living the american dream because although they did well in school theyve hardly played by the rules theyve enriched themselves with that welloiled influence peddling operation i mentioned earlier the clinton foundation and the clinton global initiative were all wondering whether hillary clinton and maybe even bill clinton might finally be indicted now that the fbi has reopened its investigation of clinton email because more of it was discovered on the laptop that anthony weiner  a former congressman under fbi investigation for sex offense  shared with his wife clinton aide huma abedin if hillary clinton is elected shell have to be impeached convicted and removed from office but thats extremely unlikely  no matter whats in the newly discovered email  if her party the democrats win a majority in the house and more than a one third minority in the senate it takes a majority in the house to impeach a president and a twothirds majority in the senate to then convict and remove a president so hillary clinton is at a berlusconi moment in her sordid career her best chance of avoiding indictment is getting elected getting back to the american dream that you can get ahead by working hard and playing by the rules bill clinton was impeached by the house of representatives for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding his affair with a yearold white house intern and his testimony in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by another former employee however his own party held a majority in the senate and they acquitted him this was all legal according to the us constitution but does it really sound like he was playing by the rules during the final days of his presidency clinton acquitted glencore international founder mark rich an international fugitive who had fled to switzerland his exwife had donated to the democratic national committee the clinton presidential library and hillary clintons new york senate campaign
according to the law president clinton had the authority to acquit rich but how would any rational person consider that anything but bribery and corruption
in  clinton polished the reputation of president nursultan nazarbayev kazakhstans autocratic leader and human rights offender who then gave a uranium mining lease to canadian businessman frank giustras shell company making it worth tens of millions of dollars overnight giustra then made a big contribution to the clinton foundation no one has claimed that this was illegal but is it playing by the rules
when guistra sold a majority stake in his company uranium one to rosatom the russian atomic energy agency it was approved by secretary of state hillary clinton giustra then contributed  million to the clinton foundation and bill clinton was offered a  speaking engagement with a russian investment bank with links to the kremlin does that sound like playing by the rules and now hillarys trying to make us believe that russias meddling in our elections and threatening confrontation with russia over syria i dont think shes kidding about the confrontation but the clinton foundation rarely passes up the chance to make another million dollars or more in any circumstances
meanwhile most of the rest of us are not living the american dream sixtythree percent of americans are living on the edge of financial catastrophe unable to handle a  car repair or a  emergency room bill  the clintons as i said serve the oligarchy they have also managed to join when bill clinton was on his way out in the last months of his presidency he worked with republicans in the lame duck congress to deregulate the banking industry by  its dishonest excessive and abusive financialization scams had crashed the economy costing millions of americans their jobs andor homes then as a new york senator hillary clinton voted to bail out the big banks who committed the crime while many of the rest of us struggled in the crashs wake
how do you explain that candidate clinton who failed as secretary of state with the death of the us ambassador in libya her health problems the scandal of emails is the candidate of the democrats
again clinton serves the interests of the oligarchy that she herself has joined many people believe that the nomination was stolen from bernie sanders the democratic candidate who spoke out against oligarchy growing income inequality and even the israeli lobbys dominance in american politics
but theres one other important element to this americans who identify as liberals supporters of womens rights andor antiracists have such a longstanding allegiance to the democratic party that supporting its nominee every four years is their kneejerk reaction ever escalating foreign wars dont seem to penetrate their consciousness or conscience especially when those wars are waged primarily with drones and proxy armies instead of us troops and once the republicans nominated the openly racist and misogynistic donald trump defeating trump became a liberal crusade
there are of course glimmers of rationality and hope yesterday i was out canvassing for an oakland california ballot measure with a young black man a college sophomore despite trumps overt racism he told me that he considers clinton even more dangerous because he understands that she has essentially promised confrontation with russia over syria he understands that such escalation increases the chance of a nuclear war accidental or not and that trump for all his faults says that the cold war is over that nato is largely obsolete and that clinton is recklessly risking confrontation with russia by promising to remove bashar alassad
our green party presidential candidate jill stein is reported to be polling at  among voters under  and much of bernie sanderss support was quite visibly from the same age group local grassroots organizing is also empowering people to create institutions free of oligarchic and corporate control they include community gardens renewable energy buyers cooperatives and gmofree zones if a ballot initiative to make californias sonoma county gmofree passes the whole northwest coast of california will be a gmofree zone from santa cruz to humboldt counties and including one inland county trinity
dont you think that the twoheaded american system with the candidates of two traditional parties democratic and republican is out of breath
i wouldnt say its out of breath because its still very much in control however trump has left the republican party in disarray with many republican luminaries and funders defecting to clinton who is welcoming them with open arms as black agenda report editor glen ford has written  the clintons have succeeded in assembling under one party roof nearly the whole of the us ruling class and their hordes of attendants and goons the scam that undergirded the duopoly system that has served the lords of capital so well for so long has come undone thanks to a white nationalist billionaire who was too spoiled to play by the corporate rules the two parties of the ruling class have become one
its hard to say whether or not the republican party will survive this election or what it will be in another four years if it does
one possibility could significantly change this if green party presidential candidate dr jill stein wins  in this election the green party will become an official national party eligible for  of the federal funds made available to official national parties to host their presidential nominating conventions and support their nominee this year all federal funds went to the two official national parties republicans and democrats who also have access to huge amounts of plutocratic and corporate money the greens take no corporate money
five percent of the vote and five percent of the federal funding for elections may not sound like much but it would be a huge watershed for the us greens it would be a big psychological and visibility boost and it would mean starting the next presidential campaign year with more than twice the funds that jill steins campaign has been able to raise
winning  would also ensure ballot access for the greens in most states not only in federal elections but also in down ballot races as it is greens are required to spend much of their time and money just gathering enough signatures to satisfy all the byzantine ballot access requirements that vary in each of the  states
everyone knows that clinton is the future president of the usa in your opinion why they are facilitated her task and who has interest in seeing clinton in the oval office
she is backed by the oligarchy corporate and dynastic particularly the investment bankers the oil industry and the weapons manufacturers who not only profit but also lobby for foreign wars they are advancing their own interests by promoting a candidate who will serve them liberals have been conditioned to function as unpaid clinton operatives in this election and the corporate media like the cops serve as protectors of the oligarchy and again the majority of americans are politically disengaged
you are close to jill stein head of the green party which emerged late in the campaign why was this alternative sabotaged
well i wouldnt say im close to jill personally but she knows who i am and i of course know who she is ive reported on her campaign and on the us greens for the past year on radio and in print and online outlets and im always honored when she shares those reports on her social media pages i write for the black agenda report and feel politically and intellectually close to its editors who have given their full support to the green party this year even as bernie sanders surged in the polls and many imagined he might actually win the democratic nomination in these times that are so easy to see as the end times shared rationality and humanity are the closest bonds that many of us have regardless of the geographic distance between us
jills campaign could hardly compete with the republicans and democrats because neither she nor any other greens solicit or accept corporate money we stand behind the slogan people and planet before profits and we call for a halt to the death march led by the weapons manufacturers fossil fuel giants and agrochemical companies who profit from it jill calls for immediately cutting the military budget by half closing all the us military bases in foreign countries and launching a peace offensive she proposes free public education from kindergarten through college the abolition of student debt national health insurance and a green new deal that would reinvest the resources now squandered on weapons manufacture and all the illegal immoral lethal and environmentally catastrophic us wars the green new deal would create a renewable energy infrastructure and sustainable agriculture before its too late to stop the climate meltdown  if it isnt too late already and it would fully employ americans in meaningful dignified and cooperative work for the common good
of course that all makes far too much sense and threatens the highly concentrated wealth and power of the deathmarch industries i would not be surprised if there were voter fraud to prevent jill stein and ajamu baraka from winning the  that would make us an official national party
i have also seen enormous oligarchic determination to stop greens at the local level in  matt gonzalez the green partys mayoral candidate in san francisco seemed to have a good chance of winning that so alarmed the democratic party that it sent all its best known most powerful names and faces to san francisco to campaign for the democratic candidate they sent hillary and bill they sent jesse jackson they sent many democratic party superstars more than once they seemed to be more concerned about defeating matt gonzalez and the greens in san francisco than they were about defeating george bush and the republicans in the following years presidential election
one of the founders of the san francisco green party was elected to the city and county board of supervisors twice but when he ran for sheriff an executive office democrats pulled him aside and said they could not allow his election unless he left the greens and joined the democratic party which he did they still got rid of him after his first term with a really ugly campaign but thats another complicated story in itself the city and county of san francisco once had more elected greens than any city or county in the country but many of those that greens worked so hard to elect have since defected to the democratic party for the sake of their political careers
is not hillary clinton a danger for humanity
hell yes i agree with congolese author and political activist patrick mbeko who said shes more dangerous than isis for all the reasons ive already mentioned her dark alliance with the deathmarch industries and her seeming eagerness to confront russia over syria andor on russias borders in the interest of global hegemony russian uranium deal aside i think that diana johnstone was most likely right when she wrote that her strategic ambition in a nutshell is regime change in russia
and i have to mention my friends from the african great lakes region  particularly uganda rwanda burundi and the democratic republic of the congo  which became the killing grounds of the s as the us using african proxies established itself as the dominant power there most of my friends from that part of the world are horrified by the clintons all but certain return to the white house the clintons are deeply committed to the false history of the rwandan war and massacres that was used to justify the first and second congo wars and later the humanitarian interventions in libya syria and iraq if the truth about rwanda and dr congo were known bill clinton would be implicated in mass murder but thats true of every us president in office in my lifetime and probably long before that no ones going to try to refer the most lethal military power in history to an international criminal court with more than symbolic authority
you have many worked on africa how do you explain the french leadership in africa
well im no expert in this but i can say a few things
first i wouldnt call it leadership id say that france sustains a neocolonial and military presence in africa france was a partner in the destruction of libya in mali niger the central african republic and the democratic republic of congo france is protecting the uranium mines essential to the nuclear power that generates  of its electricity theres no doubt that france was complicit in the assassination of resource nationalist and debt resister president thomas sankara and the installation of president blaise compaoré in burkina faso i dont see any sign that french policy towards burkina or any of its other former colonies is any more benign now despite its resignation to compaorés ouster by a popular movement
france and the us now appear to be military partners in africa more often than not but during the rwandan war and massacres and the congo wars of the s the us displaced france as the dominant power there
however a source of ongoing tension between france and the us has been their divergent accounts of the massacres known as the rwandan genocide the us defends rwandan president paul kagames account in which he is the savior who swept in to stop the carnage kagame blames france particularly for operation turquoise in which french troops created a humanitarian corridor for rwandan refugees mostly hutus who were fleeing the advance of kagames rwandan patriotic army this conflict has recently been renewed first with france reopening its investigation of allegations that kagame ordered the assassination of rwanda and burundis hutu presidents juvenal habyarimana and cyprien ntaryamira in  rwanda responded by accusing  french officers of helping to plan and organize genocide in rwanda
in  nicholas sarkozy attempted to ease the tension between france and the us and rwanda by accepting the usrwandan account of the massacres he publicly apologized for frances alleged guilt in rwandas tragedy  and shortly thereafter france was rewarded with greater access to dr congos resource riches however alain juppé who was the french prime minister at the time of the rwandan massacres and operation turquoise was having none of that he even left the country during kagames  reconciliaton visit to paris  now juppé seems to be leading sarkozy in the bid for his partys nomination and if he is elected president the history of rwanda and dr congo in the s will be more fiercely contested most of my rwandan friends very much hope that juppé will be elected because he defends the dissident history of what really happened they believe for one that operation turquoise saved many rwandan lives
while africa is a young continent how do you explain that the countries are often directed by old presidents with several mandates and who dont want lose the power
the old presidents cling to power and the western powers with geostrategic interests enable them because autocrats are easier to corrupt and control than rowdy democrats and resource nationalists who try to represent their own people rwandas kagame and ugandas museveni are two prime examples of autocrats who have proven very useful to the us and other western interests
france the us and all the rest of the nato nations appear to be united in their determination to topple burundis nkurunziza who has dared to raise an independent head and to favor the east particularly russia in resource extraction contracts i cant explain mugabes hold on power at age  or omar albashirs at  since neither are us aliies youll have to ask africans in those countries to explain that
in your opinion is not tribalism a major factor in the destabilization of africa why doesnt africa progress and does it stay in the tribal model
i really hesitate to say anything about that because im not african myself and i think western media often use the word tribe as a racial slur that disguises western resource interests at play in african conflicts i recently wrote a piece about the new film a brilliant genocide  and milton allimadi the ugandanborn editor of the black star news told me he loved the piece but asked me to remove the one instance in which id used the word tribe i told him id been hesitant about using that word and was glad to remove it im now reading his book  hearts of darkness how white writers created the racist image of africa 
why are congolese being massacred in beni territory north kivu province  the first question ive asked to try to answer that question is what resources are there in beni the answer is oil timber gold diamonds wolfram coltan and cassiterite beni is a vivid example of the saying everybody wants a piece of congo no one could convince me that the industrial nations hunger for all these riches is not at the heart of these conflicts why are all the deadly ethnic conflicts in dr congos resourcerich eastern provinces
the competition andor animosity between ethnicities or groups is often real as they are in the west but in africa the geostrategic and resource interests of the industrial nations are always in play behind the scenes western powers often exacerbate local rivalries in pursuit of their own interests
i sometimes cohost a show called afrobeatradio with my friend wuyi jacobs on wbainew york city and we both hope to someday produce a show about rwanda and burundi in which we wont have to use the words hutu or tutsi dr léopold munyakazi convinced me that these two groups are better understood not as tribes or ethnicities but as social classes in rwandan history that were exaggerated by europeans who have found it convenient to pit one group against the other
libya lives total chaos how do you analyze the situation in libya
its horrible like so much else it makes me deeply ashamed to be an american if you read hillary clintons email its easy to see that the usnato war on libya was for one another western war against another defiant resource nationalist muammar gaddafi regardless of whatever human rights offenses gaddafi or saddam hussein were guilty of both were resource nationalists as was mohammed mossadegh the secular democratically elected prime minister of iran who nationalized iranian oil before our cia and the uks m ousted him in the  coup i wrote about how this played out in libya in  clinton email we came we saw we got oil 
obama says that failing to prepare for the aftermath of the libyan war was the greatest mistake of his presidency but id say his greatest mistake was waging the libyan war in the first place like the iraq war it has created chaos and perpetual war that continues to spread through the middle east and north africa

Mikael Thalen,obama admin targets soldiers bonuses lets bad va employees keep theirs,"california national guard members wont have to pay back bonuses pentagon had been seeking repayment of enlistment bonuses paid to california guardsmen usa today  october   comments 
defense secretary ash carter ordered the pentagon on wednesday to stop clawing back excessive recruiting bonuses paid to california national guardsmen 
the move came after news broke over the weekend that the pentagon had been seeking repayment of enlistment bonuses paid to california guardsmen some of the payments were made by mistake others were taken fraudulently 
while some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming many others did not carter said in a statement about  have been asked in keeping with the law to repay erroneous payments 
as first reported by the los angeles times  the pentagon sought repayment of the excess bonuses from almost  california guard soldiers the paper reported that many of the soldiers affected had served multiple combat deployments and had been ordered to repay bonuses plus interest some had had their wages garnished and tax liens slapped on them when they refused to pay the bonus scandal was revealed after audits showed widespread overpayments",infowars.com,Fake,english,20.0,7.057613867992074,70,11,1218,191,5.329842931937173,191.0,0.245847355661357,0.1737735362073249,-0.4658571456346014,-0.4785278205247569,0.2375678634257683,-0.4781181941314372,0.0052356020942408,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0129684115801,0.9476,0.155,0.086,0.759,Positive,Very Strong
KD7ONE,no title,"the above photo was snapped in ferguson as thugs burned the city down could we see a repeat of that fateful event and perhaps a worsening of it soon to a city near you
the election is the focus of every news channel ad nauseum but few people are focused on the day after the election no matter who wins this years presidential selection the possibility of civil unrest the day after election day and beyond is a real possibility are you ready for chaos if it develops
the nation is so divided we are likely to run into problems
the ugliest scenario for the day after election day plays out if trump wins if trump wins get ready for black lives matter the black panthers the race la raza and other racially motivated antiwhite groups to come out and possibly start burning cities down again after all they have been given carte blanche all year long to do so in ferguson baltimore charlotte and san jose  a worrisome precedent has been set
of course trump wont be in power the day after election day we have to wait until inauguration day for him to clean up any potential messes so barack hussein obama is likely to give the racial hate groups the green light once again while the media whips out their collective stradivarius plays my heart bleeds for thee and sympathizes with the devils destroying the nation
if the bitch wins conservative groups may clash with leftists over rights being stripped away
if hillary wins theres the real possibility of protests the day after the election and the social conditioning of whites to be polite and docile even as theyre railroaded in what was formerly their nation may not hold this time around a hillary win means the chaos and possibly violence could wait until she starts stripping constitutional rights away then we are likely to see conservatives finally come out and start raising some righteous hell there could be racially motivated clashes on the horizon as white people standing up for themselves goes against a longestablished narrative that theyre all evil racists
few people think of the effects civil unrest could have on their livelihood and wellbeing its time for a little education on just how thinly stretched the american supply chain is and what could happen with only a shortterm disruption in it
heres a scenario  just one of many possible scenarios video of rioters stopping and then looting a semi tractortrailer in charlotte is worrying because if trucks stop america stops if attacks on truckers happen often enough truckers may decide its not worth the risk to their lives to continue moving freight around and stop driving within a day bedlam could ensue as the supply chain runs on a razors edge in modern america and everything from food to medication to gasoline starts running out
supply chain rioters broke into trucks on i and burned cargo in charlotte
according to the american trucking association ata a disruption of  to  hours means hospitals and nursing homes would run out of food fuel supplies at gas stations would also run out in that time frame garbage would start to pile up most grocery and retail stores would start to run out of food and merchandise atm and bank cash supplies would also run out
the tight rope the corporate system walks quickly breaks when merchandise stops moving
as an example the ata tells us this is what happens during a hurricane imagine what would happen with days or weeks of rioting in major cities
in a hurricane situation supplies that would normally last a few days such as water powdered milk and canned meat typically disappear within one day given these inventory rates this means that perishable goods could be depleted in a matter of days and nonperishables in just a few days runs on food and nonfood staples during hurricanes and even before big winter storms provide a good example of how fast some retail inventories can be depleted during panic buying the same quick depletion of inventories could occur if trucks stopped making deliveries for any reason
panic buying means no food on the shelves when people dont have food at home and then the grocery store doesnt have food rioting will intensify things could get ugly in a hurry as one small disruption leads to a domino effect after which bedlam ensues
so it is best to be prepared with nonperishable items just in case things get out of hand have at least several weeks food supply on hand but how do you stop people from coming and taking your stash
be armed the police wont be around to protect you if bedlam ensues
contrary to gun propaganda from the media  you absolutely want to be armed in the event the election and its aftermath dont pass peacefully what happens when stores no longer have food and gas stations no longer have gas gangs form looking for homes that do have those items
theyre going to pick out the weakest home in the neighborhood and pounce
a home with guns is a safe home just as this youtube video shows  armed thugs may bust into a house looking for money or food but they started jumping through plate glass windows and scrambling like cockroaches once the homeowner came out with guns blazing
several handguns with extra ammunition are advised know how to use them be steady with the trigger and dont be afraid to use them if looters come to your house
the police will not be there to protect you as theyll have their hands full with the chaos
better to be safe than sorry the idea of an intact nuclear family may be a trite memory but protecting your loved ones is still key
with the meltdown of america happening right before our very eyes we are entering an unstable period in the nations history to say the least no matter who wins the election the nation we once knew and loved is passing away trump may be able to turn things around temporarily but even if he does the country now has so many immigrants it will be impossible to assimilate them all
we are entering a period in which america will resemble a third world country more and more the demographics of the nation are being changed on purpose so white people are diminished at the ballot box and democrats will gain a lock grip on the levers of power in the nation in the coming years  divisions between rich and poor will grow and the evil media will be there stirring the pot with racial class and gender division every step of the way  peace will become a thing of the past as squabbling factions compete with each other for dominance
in this transition from prosperity to despotism it is best to be safe than sorry the day after election day will be telling in that it will set the tone for the next four years it may be a somewhat peaceful turn towards communism if the bitch wins or it may not be
but my money is on a steady degradation of civil society in the coming years tend your own garden as i know i will be tending my own my military friends are already discussing what will happen in shtf scenario you should be thinking about it too

Mike Rivero,how to report voter fraud  crash course,"print sidebyside of bill clinton and danney williams 
new york youtube on wednesday suspended the account of danney williams the yearold who has claimed since the s to be the black son of former president bill clinton 
youtube citing repeated or severe violations of our terms of use andor community guidelines declared the account cannot be restored 
the youtube decision blocked the nineminute feature banished  the untold story of danney williams which had received  million views since williams posted it last week produced by filmmaker joel gilbert it drew nearly  views per day and more than  viewer comments with the overwhelming majority expressing support for williams and outrage at the clintons for not being willing to allow a dna test to determine paternity 
like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network 
my youtube account has been deleted but the same video appears in  other places on youtube alone williams said on his facebook page after being notified of youtubes decision youtube cant handle the truth please share billclintonson 
twitter also continues to allow williams to post the banished video on danney williams page  but the twitter link to youtube displays the message  this video is no longer available because the youtube account associated with this video has been terminated sorry about that 
the video is still running on danney williamsclintons facebook page  as well as on the youtube channel operated by gilbert 
attempt to silence danney williams 
gilbert told wnd he helped williams file an online appeal form on youtube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated 
the behavior of youtubegoogle in suspending danneys account is outrageous there have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any youtube terms or guidelines gilbert said 
gilbert was outspoken in charging youtube with partisan political motives for the suspension 
the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danney to run him off the plantation as danney said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in  gilbert said 
danney cannot be silenced any longer he continued hillary may try to sweep danney williams under the rug but its not going to work this time his story is out there and every day more and more people understand bill and hillary clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin 
see the danney williams video feature 
wnd reported oct  that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate attorneys for williams were in las vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding dna evidence from the former president 
accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating williams that went viral on the internet 
no definitive dna test 
wnd reported that no dna test was conducted in  despite media reports to the contrary when williams claim first surfaced 
clinton defenders since  have contended the tabloid star magazine conducted a dna showdown proving bill clinton was not williams father citing star magazine editor phil bunton saying at the time there was no match nothing even close 
but in an interview bunton told wnd that no blood sample was obtained from clinton and star magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test 
i dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on clintons dna bunton told wnd 
bunton is now the owner of the rivertown magazine in haverstraw new york 
he affirmed to wnd that the tabloid relied on the dna evidence for clinton published by independent counsel kenneth starr extracted from the infamous monica lewinsky blue dress 
we got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media including the new york times wanting to know when we were going to get the dna back bunton recalled to wnd we thought it was going to turn out to be his son but when the dna came back there was no story there even to write 
the dna test released by kenneth starr was the second of two dna laboratory tests the fbi had run on clinton but the public record leaves no doubt that starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the fbi 
twitter rules 
many other figures who have challenged the democratic party or the leftleaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets including james okeefe and his project veritas which has exposed clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hiddencamera videos just as okeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud oct  twitter shut down his account  claiming violations of twitter rules the notice said he must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules which prohibit harassing other users threatening other users disclosing other users private information or violating other rules in a statement okeefe said he relies on social media to bypass the media and directly reach the public on monday okeefe wrote in a tweet project veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to youtube calling the apparent block bizarre earlier this month okeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a hillary clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day his account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hiddencamera video that exposed a clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns the daily caller reported  project veritas posted an undercover video oct  proving hillary clinton supporters were inciting violence at donald trump rallies to gain negative media coverage millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours but it didnt show up on googles trending list on youtube which google owns noted silenceisconsentnet  it did however trend on twitter which google does not own breitbart blogger milo yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by twitter minutes before his gays for trump party at the republican national convention for some  months the makers of the new movie im not ashamed about the first victim of the columbine killers in colorado in  were unable to promote their movie through youtube the trailer was taken down late in  and the movies entire channel was suspended

Activist Post,no one tried to assassinate donald trump  but austyn crites shows up in wikileaks  times,"by jon rappoport 
breaking leaked  memo from attorney kumiki gibson to clinton foundation chairman bruce lindsay gibson had been hired to do an independent assessment of the foundations practices 
below are key quotes from gibsons findings keep in mind that the clinton foundations very existence depends on it being legally certified as a nonprofit entity in compliance with laws governing nonprofits break those laws and its nonprofit status would be revoked and the whole operation would go down the drain 
gibson important responsibilities regarding corporate filings are delegated to the foundation cfo who appears to delegate them to an outside organization with very little oversight by the legal department as a result the foundation is not in compliance with the filings rules including in new york which requires the foundation to be certified to do business in the state apparently the clinton foundation was not legally registered as a nonprofit in new york 
gibson no matter what the leadership decides about the larger overarching question it must act immediately to bring the foundation into compliance with the law and standards that govern notforprofits and must create strong legal and hr offices so to prevent any lapses in the future 
gibson the foundation does not have a record retention policy and the procedures currently utilized in harlem headquarters may violate the law 
zero hedge writes furthermore and more troubling the gibson review pointed to a highranking but unnamed foundation executive who was being paid by president clinton the government and the foundation who allowed the foundation to host what may have been or may have been viewed as a political event apparently without official preapproval from the foundations legal department and without regard before the fact to the impact of that decision on the foundations tax exempt status 
this memo was written in  it would have taken then and it would now take about a month of investigation by new york state and us dept of justice officials to nail down the particulars and sink the clinton foundation 
that didnt happen then will it happen now not if the dept of justice has anything to say about it the clintons are protected 
but evidence of the foundation corruption is spreading like wildfire some fires are impossible to contain

No Author,israel settlements legal trump aide says playing antiiran video message on mount zion,"politics iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif attends a news conference after a meeting with his counterparts walid almuallem from syria and sergei lavrov from russia in moscow russia on october   photo by reuters 
iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif says comprehensive international determination is necessary to fight and uproot terrorism in the middle east 
the iranian foreign minister made the remarks at the end of a threeway meeting among him and his russian and syrian counterparts sergei lavrov and walid almuallem respectively in moscow on friday on the latest situation in syria 
zarif said tehran moscow and damascus should reinforce their cooperation in the campaign against terrorism 
he stressed the importance of adopting strategies to stop the delivery of weapons and military equipment to the foreignbacked takfiri militants wreaking havoc in syria 
the political settlement of the crisis in syria will be possible through negotiations between the sides in order to put an end to this crisis zarif said 
the three foreign ministers agreed to intensify the fight against terrorism and said their countries have a common stance on the antiterror campaign in the region particularly in syria 
lavrov said iran russia and syria have determined necessary frameworks for fighting terrorism and expressed their readiness to take measures that will play a key role in the campaign against the malicious phenomenon 
the russian foreign minister added that the moscow meeting highlighted the significance of a firm and efficient battle against terrorism in the middle east particularly in syria 
he said the meetings participants also discussed ways to send humanitarian aid to civilians in syria and stop the flow of weapons into the hands of terrorists operating in the warhit country 
muallem for his part said the us is making no effort to find a political solution to the syrian crisis 
the syrian foreign minister added that a recent agreement between washington and moscow signed in the swiss city of geneva in september failed to bear any fruit 
after marathon talks in geneva us secretary of state john kerry and his russian counterpart reached an agreement on september  to impose a ceasefire in the syrian city of aleppo and to coordinate military operations against terrorist groups in the country 
aleppo syrias second largest city remains divided between government forces in the west and foreignbacked terrorists in the east making it a frontline battleground 
russia which has been conducting an aerial military campaign against extremist militants in syria has repeatedly voiced its readiness for a ceasefire russia has been insisting however that any such lull in fighting should be accompanied with a meticulous separation of terrorists from less extremist militants fighting against the syrian government 
the syrian foreign minister said washington is not interested in solving the crisis in damascus and takes measures only to serve the its own interests and those of its regional allies 
since march  syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some western states and their regional allies backed by the russian air cover the syrian military is engaged in an operation to rid the country of daesh and other terrorist groups 
the socalled syrian observatory for human rights and united nations special envoy for syria staffan de mistura have put the death toll from the syria conflict at more than  and  respectively 
this is while the un has stopped its official casualty count in syria citing its inability to verify the figures it receives from various sources 
over the past few weeks the syrian forces have wrested control of several areas across the wartorn country as they press ahead with their counterterrorism operations 
iran russia share strong antiterror stance zarif 
meanwhile in a meeting with his russian counterpart earlier on friday the iranian foreign minister said tehran and moscow have tough stances in the fight against terrorism in the region through common strategies 
tehran and moscow have broad cooperation on regional issues such as the campaign against terrorism and extremism and we share views on these matters zarif added russian foreign minister sergei lavrov r speaks with his iranian counterpart mohammad javad zarif during a meeting in moscow russia on october   photo by reuters 
he also noted that iran and russia have succeeded in making considerable progress in all fields including in economic and political sectors as well as regional and international developments 
i am pleased that in recent years relations between the islamic republic of iran and the russian federation as two good neighbors and two key players have made many positive developments zarif said 
lavrov for his part said tehran and moscow urged cooperation on an unrelenting approach to terrorists operating against the syrian government 
iran and russia have similar stances on the ongoing deadly crisis in syria moscow and tehran reject any foreign interference in the affairs of the warhit country stressing that only the syrians are entitled to decide their own fate

Greg Freeman,myths that men believe about southeast asia,"there are some things that we have learned about the united states from this election well need to keep these in mind as we make efforts to return sanity to society
the federal government has been corrupted probably the most shocking lesson of this election is that the entire federal government has been coopted to serve a single partythe democrats the best example of this was the behavior of fbi director james comey the fbi is part of the executive branch of government so comey reports to loretta lynch who in turn reports to obama despite this fact one expects that the fbi be allowed a high degree of discretion to honestly investigate individuals regardless of which political party they belong to after all the us was founded upon the idea that we are all equal before the law
comeys actions reveal that the fbi has thrown equality before the law out the window at first the fbi investigated clintons use of an unsecure personal email server to conduct national business while she was secretary of state but even though clinton apparently violated several laws that have gotten other people severe jail sentences comey exonerated her back in july with a hand slap
in a move that surprised everyone comey reopened on october th the criminal investigation of clinton after  emails state department emails were found on pervert anthony weiners computer trump supporters rejoiced and hillary supporters expressed outrage but the white house calmly called comey a man of integrity did they know something we didnt
it turns out the fix was in from the beginning because just  hours before election day comey exonerated clinton again  the fbi director likely intended to clear clinton of wrongdoing before the election to defuse donald trumps criticism of her
the big lesson is that the law is applied selectively wealthy politicallyconnected people dont need to play by the same rules as everyone else unless this situation is corrected it means the rule of law is deadand that is a very grave lesson indeed
the elites are in control but elites want you to believe they are super smart and super powerful like the great oz
ive written many times about the control that globalist elites exert on the country through their control of the media educational institutions and politicians through the form of bribes donations cushy job offers speaking fees by controlling the flow of information and setting the narrative the globalists are able to control the masses like cattle the good news is that their control is not complete they are not omnipotent
the weakness of the elites has been demonstrated in three ways the first was with the brexit vote when prime minister david cameron agreed to hold a referendum on the uks membership in the eu he never dreamed that britons would actually vote to leave all the polls at the time showed that any movement to leave would go down in flames still through the work of men like nigel farage and boris johnson the british populace voted to leave the eu the brits on the leave side had to endure being called racist and look past polling that said they had no chance to win
the second way was the campaign of trump himself the gop had planned a coronation for jeb bush the rest of the gop field was me too candidates who were virtually indistinguishable from jeb trump came in with an uncompromising message and crushed jeb and the rest of the little jebs the elite plan to have hillary versus a weak conservative was completely thrown into disarray by trumps campaign even if trump has lost the general it is still a victory because now instead of seeing the great oz we see the globalists behind the curtain
the third manifestation of the weakness of the elites is the rise of the alt right a tiny group of young people on the internet was able to quickly wake up large segments of the population only a year ago terms like nationalism and globalism were rarely heard in the us now we have grandmothers in texas tweeting about how we need to lay the axe to the globalists
the overall lesson is that we should not fear the globalist elite they exist and they are able to fool a majority of the population but not all of us with sound strategy they can be defeated
the elite have completely divorced themselves from nonelites 
in the past europe had an aristocracy this aristocracy had a close relationship with the rest of the people in the country the aristocracy was expected to defend the nation in case of war they also had the same religion as the rest of the country we already knew that the modern aristocracy of the globalist elites has no responsibilities toward the rest of us but thanks to wikileaks we have now learned that they dont even share the same religion
wikileaks revealed that hillary clinton and her campaign manager are close friends with marina abramovic a serbian artist who performs occult rituals she calls  spirit cooking  spirit cooking appears to be set of magical rituals that use bodily fluids such as menstrual blood urine and semen to achieve certain goals usually sexrelated it also involves at least minor sacrifices one recipe calls for cutting ones figure and eating the pain
while spirit cooking is certainly grotesque it is not my intention to focus on it except to point out that it has become a sort of initiation ritual into the us globalist elite hillary clinton john podesta jayz and beyonce lady gaga and gwen stefani have all attended these rituals and i would not be surprised to learn that many other politicians ceos and bankers also participate getting invited to one of these spirit cooking sessions means that you have gained entry into the wealthy elite in the us there are probably similar groups or rituals for the modern day european elites
there are several things at work here most of the spirit cooking participants probably dont believe in the efficacy of the spirit cooking ritual it is more like a college fraternity initiation it only means something in terms of ones social standing also the satanic imagery of spirit cooking and its sexual overtones are big middle fingers to christianity which our elite regard as the religion of the unwashed masses
in both of these ways our modern elite have separated themselves from the rest of us they dont share the same destiny as us if the country starts going to hell the wealthy elite can just pick up and move to another country or they can live in small heavily guarded compounds untouched by the damage their policies have caused and they even lack a common morality with us in their own eyes their wealth has somehow put them beyond the traditional moral code that guides the rest of us
the fact that the elites have no regard for the rest of the country does not bode well for them the aristocracy of old knew that their fortune was bound up with that of their countrymen the modern elite lack this wisdom once enough of the hoi polloi realize it it is only a matter of time before these pseudoelites are deposed from their pedestal
conclusion with trumps election the problem of federal government being used for political purposes will be mitigated however the problems with our indulgent pseudoelite will continue to be a force that prevents the patriarchy from returning in any case we can be grateful that the election of  has exposed some of the cancers that are eating away at our society

the bigger point here is what the two are willing to do in order to remain in power most people know that you cant trust hillary as far as you can throw her  which isnt very far  so the fact that she has any supporters is beyond baffling at this point this woman is corrupt and fake to the core lets just hope all of america wakes up to this reality before its too late and she can do any more damage than she already has 
bill and hillary clinton just cant stay out of the spotlight these days and the most recent leak about them could be the most damaging yet as it turns out someone once close to the duo just came forward to share bills revealing nickname for his wife  but the worse comes as their dirty bedroom habits were exposed 
its no mystery that bill clinton is a sexual deviant but the most recent account given by the woman who had a decade affair with the man is damning to say the least according to an exclusive interview given to mail online dolly kyle was behind the scenes long enough to not only know the twos darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits  and now shes telling everyone 
the connection between dolly and bill began when she was just yearsold he was about yearsold at the time but dolly states that there was an immediate attraction even then as the years progressed the two became romantically involved and stayed that way through several of their marriages over the next  years 
the real affair began in  just after dolly divorced her first husband and although bill wasnt married yet he would be within the year although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship she states that she snapped when she heard hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the right to be believed 
knowing full well just what hillary had done  between the threats and the lies  to the many women who either had an affair with or were sexually assaulted by her husband bill dolly knew she had to do something about it unfortunately for hillary dolly is now coming forward with the dirty word nickname bill husband once called hillary among other things 
according to mail online bill approached dolly at their high schools year reunion to talk about  the warden  aka hillary saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage this was the least significant account dolly had to share 
in fact dolly recalls that bill mentioned something about having a baby to her although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her he was actually talking about hillary he wanted to put to bed the rumors that hillary was a lesbian even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true 
dolly states that the worst came when she met hillary for the first time in that moment i noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering body odor of perspiration and greasy hair i hoped that i wouldnt gag when she got in my car she said the sandalshod woman with lank smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone

citis chief political analyst tina fordham has had a busy month 
at the start of october  when trumps victory odds were in the gutter and a clinton presidency had been priced in  in a hotly debated statement she suggested that the establishment may be approaching the us presidential completely incorrectly this is an unusual juncture but we keep looking at it through the same kinds of lenses what if its all wrong because society technology opinion polling methods and everything else dont capture marginalized voters in the way they might once have 
according to fordham the us presidential race felt more like an election in a developing nation where public distrust in government is high and conspiracy theories are rife markets seem unaware how much that low trust raises the risk of an antiestablishment vote fordham has focused on the gallup world poll on public health which analyzes two decades worth of health records of trump supporters the numbers show a correlation between the increase in the number of people going through difficult times  as measured by suicide rates depression mental illness and drug addiction  and the rise in trumps popularity fordham said 
this is the kind of thing that investors just dont normally run into but it provides another useful way to think about things because income inequality is necessary but not sufficient she said there is something more subtle going on about public expectations and exhaustion and a sense of corruption elite abuse of power and lack of control 
her conclusion was troubling for clinton fans  im getting this brexity feeling and i know other investors are as well she said the thinking is i didnt expect brexit so i better assume trump is going to win that element of investor psychology is at play here 
she followed up on monday  when she predicted that the fbis friday announcement could have a meaningful impact on the presidential race and cautioned that this may not be the end of it we continue to emphasize the potential for more black swan events emerging making things more complicated for forecasters and pollsters 
today in her latest media appearance fordham has penned an oped for the ft looking at the postelection landscape and warning that  investors face political risk whoever wins in the us election  
she first analyzes if a a clinton victory will mean business as usual for america and the global order and responds  not so fast 
investors should brace themselves for the new form of advanced economy political risk what ever the outcome of the us presidential election 
first any market relief from a victory for mrs clinton over donald trump her republican opponent will almost certainly be followed by the realization that a divided congress will mean a return to gridlock and brinkmanship over the debt ceiling with little prospect for reform 
more broadly following the vote in the uk to leave the eu the rise of mr trump and according to a yougov study authoritarian populism politics in advanced economies are having what might be termed an emerging markets moment vox populi risk a concept i formulated in  after a wave of protests coups and the rise of nonmainstream political parties has become a global phenomenon 
she then notes that the economic and market implications of advanced economy political risks are more likely to become systemically significant than their emerging markets counterparts according to the international monetary funds recently published world economic outlook political risk in the advanced economies has become the biggest threat to global growth 
specifically she envisages the trump campaign 
from threats to jail opponents on corruption charges to the proliferation of conspiracy theories the trump campaign and its supporters have borrowed heavily from the em political playbook sowing doubts not only about his opponents suitability for office but also about us political institutions a majority of republicans now say they believe the election will be rigged according to data from pew research center despite the lack of any precedent in us election history for such claims 
reverting to her notion that the us election looks a lot like that of a developing nation she notes that  what links this advanced economy political risk with its em cousin is low trust in institutions and elites  political and business elites expertsand the media it is trust plus belief in the future not growth alone that immunizes the body politic against the populist virus the collapse of trust is also evident in the sheer number of outright lies the factchecking website politifact has tracked during the campaign if everything is bogus than anything goes  
there are also the market implications 
the reaction of financial markets may be the starkest illustration of this change in trend according to the brookings institution the effect of mr trumps candidacy has been to give rise to price movements suggesting that a trump victory would reduce the value of the sp  and lead to a  per cent decline in the mexican peso as well as pricing in future volatility 
however fordhams punchline has little to do with a trump victory but rather the consequences of another clinton presidency 
mr trump may be heading for defeat but the prevalence of low trust identity politics and demographic divides across the developed world suggests that he will not be the last nonmainstream candidate to come close to power  this constellation of risks will be in evidence before elections next year in germany france and the netherlands and will have a significant impact on brexit negotiations moreover a clinton presidency is highly likely to be marked by nearcontinuous investigations as well as the risk of impeachment 
if citi is right the preelection circus and endless drama and theatrics is just the beginning of what is about to be unleashed a world in which the political realities of dm and em worlds will converge the new normal in advanced economies looks a lot like the emerging markets old normal but with considerably higher stakes for the global economy we encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaking news and videos  click for details

thats where you come in
the trump administration is now soliciting people to apply for jobs for when the man himself takes office in january we are officially calling on all ready and able return of kings readers to submit their applications and take up any job offers heres why you should consider a job in president trumps administration beyond obvious reasons such as money and prestige
 itll help keep president trump accountable 
while the media is lying about trump reneging on his campaign promises its still a good idea to give the man more reasons to keep his word by staffing his administration with committed nationalists well make it easier for president trump to fulfill his political program as well as make it more difficult for him to go back on his promises remember it was rankandfile fbi agents who forced james comey to reopen the investigation into hillary clinton  a leader needs loyal men in order to carry out his agenda
 youll be able to make history 
given the momentous task of rebuilding america after eight years of obamas perfidy and failure you almost have a civic duty to help president trump in his mission expecting america to become great again all on its own is delusional we need to do our part to restore this nations glory by working with the trump administration youll have a direct role in reshaping america for yearspossibly decadesto come
 youll help trigger the left 
despite their massive losses in the electionbeyond hillary clintons defeat the democrats now control only a handful of state governments and failed to dent the gops congressional majoritythe leftist mainstream media is trying to order trump around and persuade him to staff his administration with the same flacks who filled bushs and obamas right now theyre freaking out over breitbart executive chairman stephen bannon being appointed as trumps chief strategist 
by joining the trump administration youll have a hand in helping trigger the left into conniption fits and spasms of impotence nothing horrifies them more than losing access to the levers of power which theyve controlled for decades watching leftists squirm and cry is one of the biggest fringe benefits of trumps victory and we need to keep the triggering up for years to come
if you think you have the job skills return of kings highly recommends you apply for a job in trumps administration  president trump may have started the fire but its our job to help the fire rise

Henry Wolff,california set to let public schools teach primarily in spanish,"new las vegas casino only for chinese gamblers  
los angeles times 
casino operators know there are no gamblers quite like the chinese 
with their affinity for baccarat the most lucrative game in las vegas chinese gamblers have long commanded special treatment  be it with private chinese gaming salons lunar new year festivities or performances from pop stars flown in from hong kong and taiwan 
no one in las vegas however has built a casino and hotel strictly for chinese visitors until now 
the lucky dragon hotel  casino is billing itself as las vegas first asianthemed resort funded in large part by chinese investors the property set to open dec  with a traditional lion dance will offer bilingual staff and signage a luxury tea bar and a host of restaurants with food that wouldnt look or taste out of place in guangzhou or shanghai 
no general tsos or egg rolls here said david jacoby chief operating officer for the resort which left no chinese superstition unturned 
the rosecolored resorts front entrance is designed in a dragon motif a feng shui master blessed its kitchens the main bar is eightsided for good fortune and its hard to find a no  on the property the unlucky digit is absent from room numbers and the phone directory the ninestory hotel even skips a fourth floor 
this place is heavily feng shuied jacoby said 
with all that attention to detail youd think lucky dragons brain trust was born in beijing but the idea behind the room boutique resort off the northern end of the las vegas strip was largely conceived by an american veteran gaming executive bill weidner the former president and chief operating officer of las vegas sands corp 
weidner an advisor to lucky dragon is no neophyte to the chinese market he worked with some of chinas most powerful government figures to lead sands expansion into macau when the former portuguese colony relaxed its monopoly on gaming licenses in  macau now generates nearly five times the gambling revenue of the las vegas strip forever changing the fortunes of the global casino industry 
weidner was also involved in the development of the billion marina bay sands in singapore before leaving the company in a bitter dispute in  
weidner and jacoby know major las vegas gaming resorts like the sands venetian mgm or wynn already cater to chinas high rollers with vip parlors and relationships forged in macau 
lucky dragon though tiny compared with those properties addresses what they see as a gap in the market middleclass chinese gamblers chinese americans as well as the broader asian american community 
let them fight over the  and let us fight over the remaining  said jacoby who previously worked for weidners firm global gaming asset management opening a casino resort in the philippines 
that pool of chinese gamers will almost certainly grow on dec  hainan airlines will fly the first direct flights from china to las vegass mccarran international airport lucky dragon guests are confirmed to be on that flight jacoby said 
already a record  visitors from china traveled to las vegas last year nearly double the number in  according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority 
meanwhile ground was broken on another asianthemed resort this one much bigger than lucky dragon resorts world a malaysian hospitality and casino giant with decades of asian gaming experience is spending up to  billion for a room property on the north strip that will feature chinese architecture such as an ersatz great wall its slated to open in  
plans are also underway to build a billion resort on the strip called alon las vegas the project is owned by australias crown resort who count chinese gamers as a major source of business 
its going to be even more of a competitive market said john decree an analyst at union gaming in las vegas everyones coming for the same customer its going to be a challenge with  rooms the hotel is small compared with many on the strip but with five restaurants it offers more dining options than many its size isaac brekken  for the times 
competition could also be fierce for chinese high rollers whose gambling activity has been curtailed by a slowing chinese economy and an anticorruption campaign at home that until recently sent macau gambling revenues into a twoyear slump 
las vegas isnt immune to those headwinds after years of explosive growth casinos on the strip experienced a decline in the amount of money bet on baccarat to about  billion in  thats nearly  billion less than  according to the nevada gaming control board 
the casino industry uses the card game as a proxy for chinese gambling activity because of its massive popularity within the culture thats both for practical and superstitious reasons baccarat has the best statistical odds of beating the house compared with other games and as a game of chance over skill baccarat also plays into chinese fatalistic attitudes toward luck 
the vast majority of baccarat play comes from the asian market said jacoby of lucky dragon 
jacobys casino will offer seven vip baccarat tables on a secondfloor terrace with access to a vast menu of authentic chinese food in addition to live seafood flown in from all over the world the property will serve staples like congee wonton noodles and dim sum 
food is expected to be a big draw because chinese vacationers overwhelmingly prefer their native cuisine over others 
las vegas has a number of wellregarded chinese restaurants such as ping pang pong at gold coast hotel  casino china mama in chinatown and an outpost of chengdu taste the san gabriel valley stalwart for sichuan cuisine highend chinese food is also served at highroller rooms such as the venetians paiza club 
no casino however boasts the concentration of chinese restaurants that lucky dragon will with five altogether the hope is chinese tourists staying at other properties will choose to eat  and gamble  at lucky dragon when they venture off the strip 
the emphasis on food means lucky dragons owners can eschew things that arent particularly important to chinese tourists like a whiskey bar or nightclub and because chinese tourists often dont like to sunbathe lucky dragons pool isnt much bigger than the backyard variety 
jacoby says his competitors on the strip offer chinese gamers a diluted experience by operating a handful of chinese restaurants and parlors in megacasinos that have to serve all manner of people not just chinese by comparison visitors to lucky dragon can start conversing in mandarin with staff as soon as they walk in he said 
were trying to take the asian gaming experience and bring that front and center instead of hiding the most valuable customer in a segregated portion of a large building jacoby said 
though lucky dragon will rely heavily on asian american customers at first its funding was largely drawn from mainland chinese investors through the federal eb visa program the visa allows foreigners and their immediate family to gain permanent us residency in exchange for a minimum investment of  that also creates american jobs rather than focusing on bars and nightclubs the casino is prioritizing dining options that includes a tea room still under construction isaac brekken  for the times 
chinese investors have dominated the program nationwide accounting for  of applicants awaiting eb visas though occasionally subject to fraud the program has successfully funded a handful of mixedused projects in new york the jw marriott hotel at la live and the sls hotel  casino across from lucky dragon 
jacoby declined to say how many chinese investors are involved in lucky dragon which is expected to employ  people jacoby also declined to disclose how much the project cost adding that earlier media reports pegging the price tag at about  million were inaccurate 
the company hit a snag last year when it unsuccessfully sought tax subsidies from the city but financial commitments from weidners family and others put the project back on track

lebanons minister of foreign affairs gebran bassil says the lebanese resistance movement hezbollah shares the victory of michel aoun in securing the countrys presidency 
aoun a strong hezbollah ally was chosen by lebanese lawmakers as the countrys president on monday 
addressing a large number of people who had converged at a square in beirut to celebrate aouns election bassil who is also the head of the free patriotic movement fpm and aouns soninlaw said his movement never doubted hezbollahs loyalty and honesty aoun is the founder of the fpm 
he said aouns victory was based on his own perseverance as well as the positions adopted by sayyed hassan nasrallah who is hezbollahs secretary general 
in a phone call on the same day nasrallah congratulated aoun on his election as the head of the lebanese state this image taken in the southern suburbs of beirut on october   shows people celebrating the election of michel aoun as the new president of lebanon 
nasrallah endorsed aoun last week advising lebanese political factions to set aside their differences in order to fill the presidential void in the arab country

after the election aoun vowed in a speech to the parliament that he would spare no effort in trying to bring about the liberation of lebanese territories occupied by israel

Henry Wolff,hence this is racist,"obsessing over europes refugee crisis while ignoring africas is white privilege at work mehdi hasan washington post november   
have you not heard europe is in the throes of a refugee crisis hosting asylumseekers from syria is a historic test of europe says germanys angela merkel the most responsibility for refugees is and will continue to be placed on europe adds european council president donald tusk 
for president obama uncontrolled migration into europe is a major national security issue for the united states even the dalai lama agrees that there are too many refugees inside the european union 
really too many historic consider these facts more than  million people were forced from their homes by conflict or persecution in  according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr  including  million people classified as refugees living outside the borders of their own countries 
admittedly a record  million refugees sought asylum within the european union last year with thousands more applying for asylum every month yet what of subsaharan africa home to  million refugees and a whopping  million people of concern to the un high commissioner for refugees 
we dont often hear about these particular refugees or asylumseekers do we they are to borrow a term from british historian mark curtis unpeople the poor nonwhite residents of the developing world who tend to be ignored by the western media 
where is the rolling coverage of kenyas dadaab camp for example dadaab is the largest refugee camp in the world but in a move that could displace as many as  people  kenyan authorities are in the process of closing it down it puts the recent british media frenzy over the socalled jungle camp in calais france with its  migrants into some perspective doesnt it 
snip 
yet europes refugee crisis continues to suck up all the oxygen of global publicity the unhcr fundraises for a whole host of special situations involving refugees as of the end of october the  central african republic situation  was  percent funded the  somalia situation   percent funded and the  south sudan situation   percent funded the  crisis in europe  however fiftysix percent funded 
the double standard is as brazen as it is shameful remember the european union accounts for  percent of global gdp  subsaharan africa accounts for a little more than  percent  
snip 
this is not just navelgazing hyperbole but white privilege plain and simple how else to describe a collective tendency to obsess over a refugee crisis in rich white europe rather than in poor black africa in what warped world are thousands of penniless and homeless refugees considered to constitute a crisis only when they wash up on the shores of western europe",amren.com,Fake,english,16.093066489392562,11.326876277819148,20,4,2735,444,5.076576576576577,444.0,-1.2829046114927765,-1.141531470845462,-0.0645019229753224,-0.0819045806386157,-0.0123811913185692,-0.0722220584812452,0.0135135135135135,0.0,0.0,0,6,0.0,0.033472521781069,-0.9902,0.042,0.119,0.838,Negative,Very Strong
Letsbereal,no title,"the most interesting books of the bible for those who arent believers in god are the wisdom books of job and ecclesiastes written from a philosophical point of view they attempt to help people live with suffering and pain while putting existence into context
book of job 
job is a devout believer in god who follows all of his rules he has been blessed with incredible wealth and numerous children satan then challenges god by arguing that job is only faithful because of what he has gained and that he would immediately curse god if everything was taken away from him god allows satan to destroy him taking his wealth and killing all of his children
once the misfortune befalls job his wife implores him to curse god but job refuses instead he openly laments at why god is allowing him to suffer he even asks god to allow him to die
i would rather be strangled
rather die than suffer like this
i hate my life and dont want to go on living
oh leave me alone for my few remaining days job 
why make me your target
am i a burden to you
why not just forgive my sin
and take away my guilt
for soon i will lie down in the dust and die
when you look for me i will be gone job 
what do you gain by oppressing me
why do you reject me the work of your own hands
while smiling on the schemes of the wicked job 
he then has a series of poetic dialogues with priestly men in an attempt to explain gods justice job asks some pointed questions implying that those who are eager to sin seem to experience more prosperity than those who closely follow gods words
the godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine
its branches spreading across the garden
its roots grow down through a pile of stones
it takes hold on a bed of rocks
but when it is uprooted
its as though it never existed job 
when a plague sweeps through
he laughs at the death of the innocent
the whole earth is in the hands of the wicked
and god blinds the eyes of the judges
if hes not the one who does it who is job 
just like how there are so many laws in the legal code that you are always on the hook for something illegal there are also so many possible sins that it may be impossible to live a clean life
whatever happens i will be found guilty
so whats the use of trying
even if i were to wash myself with soap
and clean my hands with lye
you would plunge me into a muddy ditch
and my own filthy clothing would hate me job 
the men that job spills his guts to state that hes sinning in some way and knows nothing about how god works and that he must grin and bear it instead of questioning gods actions
pay attention to this job
stop and consider the wonderful miracles of god
do you know how god controls the storm
and causes the lightning to flash from his clouds
do you understand how he moves the clouds
with wonderful perfection and skill
when you are sweltering in your clothes
and the south wind dies down and everything is still
he makes the skies reflect the heat like a bronze mirror
can you do that job 
god appears and asks job how dare he question his actions even though those actions amounted to an agreement with satan
who is this that questions my wisdom
with such ignorant words
brace yourself like a man
because i have some questions for you
and you must answer them
where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth
tell me if you know so much
who determined its dimensions
and stretched out the surveying line
what supports its foundations
and who laid its cornerstone
as the morning stars sang together
and all the angels shouted for joy job 
god goes on to describe his powers and then serves a how dare you argument to job who then accepts his utter impotence
then the lord said to job
do you still want to argue with the almighty
you are gods critic but do you have the answers
then job replied to the lord
i am nothinghow could i ever find the answers
i will cover my mouth with my hand
i have said too much already
i have nothing more to say job 
you asked who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance
it is iand i was talking about things i knew nothing about
things far too wonderful for me
you said listen and i will speak
i have some questions for you
and you must answer them
i had only heard about you before
but now i have seen you with my own eyes
i take back everything i said
and i sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance job 
other parts of the bible channel job by asking why bad on earth is allowed to continue
wake up o lord why do you sleep
get up do not reject us forever
why do you look the other way
why do you ignore our suffering and oppression
we collapse in the dust
lying face down in the dirt
rise up help us
ransom us because of your unfailing love psalm 
and the usual response is to not question god
what sorrow awaits those who argue with their creator
does a clay pot argue with its maker
does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it saying
stop youre doing it wrong
does the pot exclaim
how clumsy can you be
how terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father
why was i born
or if it said to its mother
why did you make me this way isaiah 
after job stopped questioning god he was rewarded with even greater prosperity than before
so the lord blessed job in the second half of his life even more than in the beginning for now he had  sheep  camels  teams of oxen and  female donkeys he also gave job seven more sons and three more daughters he named his first daughter jemimah the second keziah and the third kerenhappuch in all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of job and their father put them into his will along with their brothers job lived  years after that living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren then he died an old man who had lived a long full life job 
you have to be patient with god
those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy they weep as they go to plant their seed but they sing as they return with the harvest psalm 
the lesson of this story seems to be one of stoicism accept your fate dont question it and understand that what you have now can be taken from you at a moments notice if god wants to no matter how cleanly you have lived in his honor ironically this book did more to make me question gods wisdom than any other
book of ecclesiastes 
the next wisdom book is ecclesiastes purportedly written by kings david son solomon who amassed onethousand wives during his reign as king of israel his wife collection led to him serving other gods and he was punished for it when god broke up the kingdom of israel ecclesiastes is the book that solomon wrote at the end of his life sharing all that he learned
everything is meaningless says the teacher completely meaningless what do people get for all their hard work under the sun generations come and generations go but the earth never changes the sun rises and the sun sets then hurries around to rise again the wind blows south and then turns north around and around it goes blowing in circles rivers run into the sea but the sea is never full then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea everything is wearisome beyond description no matter how much we see we are never satisfied no matter how much we hear we are not content history merely repeats itself it has all been done before nothing under the sun is truly new ecclesiastes 
what is the point of accumulating wisdom in life why work hard
for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow ecclesiastes 
i thought wisdom is better than foolishness just as light is better than darkness for the wise can see where they are going but fools walk in the dark yet i saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate both will die so i said to myself since i will end up the same as the fool whats the value of all my wisdom this is all so meaningless for the wise and the foolish both die ecclesiastes 
so what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety their days of labor are filled with pain and grief even at night their minds cannot rest it is all meaningless ecclesiastes 
all is vanity
for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is vanity all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again ecclesiastes 
promiscuous and bad women are sent forth as a punishment from god
i discovered that a seductive woman is a trap more bitter than death her passion is a snare and her soft hands are chains those who are pleasing to god will escape her but sinners will be caught in her snare ecclesiastes 
solomon tries to convince himself that evil will not prosper but he cant help coming back to the fact that it does
when a crime is not punished quickly people feel it is safe to do wrong but even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time i know that those who fear god will be better off the wicked will not prosper for they do not fear god their days will never grow long like the evening shadows and this is not all that is meaningless in our world in this life good people are often treated as though they were wicked and wicked people are often treated as though they were good this is so meaningless ecclesiastes 
at this moment it seems that solomon goes off the rails by seemingly promoting a life of debauchery
so i recommend having fun because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat drink and enjoy life that way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work god gives them under the sun ecclesiastes 
one interpretation of this is that if you live in sin like solomon you will eventually come to the conclusion that life is meaningless all is for naught and the only purpose is to have fun the book may have been included in the bible to serve as an example of what will happen to you if behave as solomon and come to the end of your life thinking that it wasnt worth it i hope this was the intended result because otherwise it would cause you to lose faith in gods own wisdom in justice just like with job
the wisdom books of the bible raise questions of gods justice and plans for his human subjects why do people suffer or prosper why does life feel like its not being guided by god these questions vexed the jews enough that they honored other gods to get more immediate results and then jesus christ came along to say that it will all be worth itnot necessarily now but in the eternal afterlife as long as you accept him as your savior

No Author,kellyanne conway loses it on jake tapper when he calls out trumps bigoted fans video,"on november    am  
donald trumps deplorable supporters arent waiting for the election results to start spilling blood 
theyve been threatening bloody violence ever since trump began claiming that the election is rigged in favor of hillary clinton and trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places 
in texas last week a trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of trumps stupid hats and a deplorables tshirt to vote 
election code prohibits any person from electioneering within  feet of a polling place 
of course trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules dont apply to them 
well now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down 
at collin college in plano texas a trump sign was discovered ziptied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places 
but when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside the blades sliced into the volunteers hands and drew blood requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal 
it just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody whos probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other local democratic party campaign chair steve spainhouer said in response  i think most people have already made their minds up at this point how theyre going to vote and so theres nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful 
heres the video via ktvt  
frankly this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism trumps supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as election day approaches and if trump loses his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup 
clearly these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger but you wont hear donald trump condemning this act of violence after all he is the one inciting it

the death of john kennedy by michael rivero
there have been two official investigations one concluded oswald acted alone the other that there was a conspiracy after half a century many of the key documents which could tell the whole story remain classified john f kennedys brain is still missing from the national archives why if it is an open and shut case why the secrecy if oswald was just a crazed lone gunman 
the house select committee on assassinations concluded that john f kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy based on the recording of the gunshots fired in dealey plaza captured over a police radio a total of  impulses were caught on the tape but citing budgetary constraints the hsca only had  of them analyzed the analysis concluded that all  were gunshots two of them occurring within  a second of each other too close to be fired by one man comparisons of the echoes with test shots fired in dealey plaza confirmed that at least one of the recorded shots had indeed been fired from the grassy knoll needless to say the existence of  rather than just  gunshots destroyed the oswald as lone gunman coverup warren supporters quickly tried to dismiss the audio record of the gunshots by claiming that the recording was actually of gunshots in another part of the city and confused for dealey plaza shots because of a timing error without explaining just where the other shots had occurred or why the echo patterns exactly matched the test shots fired in dealey plaza the warren supporters declared victory new research has shown that the report that dismissed the audio recording of the gunshots was itself deeply flawed and ignored evidence that confirmed both the location and time of the recording as being in dealey plaza at the time of the jfk assassination this means that the original house select committee on assassinations conclusion is the correct one there were at least five gunshots in dealey plaza two of them within  second of each other and at least one of the shots came from the grassy knoll update the deathbed confession of cia agent e howard hunt to his son on the jfk assassination update numerous witnesses had reported a large obvious exit wound in the back of kennedys head consistent with the reports of a gunshot from the grassy knoll the warren commission dismissed the exit wound and reports of a shooter on the grassy knoll and published in their report photographs of the back of kennedys head that showed no damage now it has been revealed that the warren commission did not publish the actual autopsy photos but substituted photos taken after morticians had reconstructed kennedys head an anticipation of a possible open casket viewing prior to the funeral  as had been done with lincoln 
although described as a mixup the simplest explanation is deliberate deception by the warren commission dan rathers fib 
dan rather at the time an unknown newscaster from a small market texas tv station viewed the zapruder film then described it to america on the cbs network as this recording of that broadcast shows rather lied to all of america in claiming that the head shot pushed john f kennedys head forward 
rather makes the claim that kennedys head rocketed forward at  in the above video he also makes a point of saying there were only three shots in total rathers meteoric rise to network status and stardom soon followed this broadcast when the zapruder film was finally shown publicly during jim garrisons trial of cia agent clay shaw rathers lie was revealed for all to see a revealing wink 
most americans who lived through the kennedy assassination are very familiar with the above photo of vice president lyndon johnson being sworn in as president aboard air force one

were still waiting on trumps state and defense picks but hes already out of the gate with senator jeff sessions for attorney general its november  
the media are so eager to bury trumps administration that they are falling all over themselves to do so instead of soberly covering potential problems with top level picks  steve bannon for example is a rotten pick  but not because hes a racist or antisemite  the media keep proclaiming the end is near this sort of alarmism doesnt convince americans who dont really see why theres any giant rush to appoint people who arent going to be formally considered by the senate until january  anyway

Luke Stranahan,what to do in an ammo panic,"leave a reply 
steve taylor phd  from the standpoint of ordinary consciousness separateness seems to be a basic part of the human condition most human beings experience themselves as egos trapped inside their own mindspace observing a world which seems to be out there on the other side of their skulls as a result the normal human state is one of aloneness were always onlookers rather than participants we can communicate with other people by speaking writing or gesturing but they will never be able to truly know us or to share our thoughts and feelings our inner being will always be sealed off from them 
egoseparation also creates a sense of incompleteness because were separate from the world were like fragments which have broken off from the whole and so feel a sense of insufficiency there s a kind of hole inside us which we spend most of our lives trying to fill but very rarely manage to like cats who were taken away from their mother at birth and who are always hankering for affection and attention to try to compensate for a sense of lack bornagain christians mean something close to this when they say that there is a godshaped hole inside us although in my view traditional religion cant fill the hole either only provide the same ultimately incomplete consolation as wealth or success 
as a result of this aloneness and incompleteness we dont feel completely at home in the world were not completely rooted here and so feel somehow adrift as if we dont fully belong like people who have travelled around the world so much that they no longer feel at home anywhere whereas traditional indigenous peoples seem to perceive the world as a benign and benevolent place to us it seems indifferent and even vaguely malevolent 
in addition our egoisolation generates a basic sense of insecurity and insignificance our own ego is so tiny and so flimsy in the face of the enormous world out there  like a tiny wooden beach shack at the edge of a vast ocean we feel dwarfed by the sheer weight of the phenomena and events taking place out there  how can we possibly have any significance in relation to them how can this fragile entity inside our heads stand up to the might of the world the wider effects of separateness 
however the effects of this separateness reach far beyond the individual in fact i would go so far as to say that the sense of separateness is the root cause of the constant conflict warfare and oppression which have blighted human history the human sense of incompleteness generates a craving for possessions power and status as a way of trying to complete ourselves and compensate for our inner discord we try to complete ourselves  and make ourselves significant  by gaining power over other people or by collecting wealth and possessions 
this desire for wealth and power is the root cause of warfare and oppression too coupled with the reduced empathy which separateness causes the separate self walls us off from other human beings makes it difficult for us to feel with them and to experience the world from their perspective this makes it possible for us to be violent and cruel to other people since we cant sense the suffering we cause them so we oppress and exploit them in the service of our own desires oppress women members of lower classes or castes different races so that we can gain more power status and wealth 
the sense of separateness is also the root cause of our abuse of the environment it means that we experience a sense of otherness to nature and that we cant sense its aliveness and as a result we dont feel any qualms about exploiting and abusing it why separateness 
i wouldnt exactly say that separateness is an illusion as many nonduality teachers would not an illusion but an aberration  something which exists but shouldnt children dont experience separateness they exist in a state of natural relatedness to the world this is one of the reasons why childhood is so wonderful because the child feels connected to everything around them in a participatory flow with all experience with no in here or out there 
there are also many other peoples in the world who even as adults dont exist in a state of separateness most of the world s indigenous peoples dont see themselves as separate to their environment they feel a strong sense of connection to nature an awareness that they are a part of the web of creation and one which is no more important than any other 
as tim ingold writes of the batek negritos of malaysia for example they see themselves as involved in an intimate relationship of interdependence with the plants animals and hala spirits including the deities which inhabit their world or as the cherokee indian scholar rebecca adamson points out for indigenous peoples the environment is perceived as a sensate conscious entity suffused with spiritual powers through which the human understanding is only realised in perfect humility before the sacred whole the hopi use the term novoitti for the concept of living in harmony with nature while the tlingit also of north america call it shogan 
the anthropologist lucien levybruhl believed that essential characteristic of native peoples was that the limits of their individuality are variable and illdefined he noted that rather than existing as selfsufficient individual entities indigenous peoples sense of identity was bound up with their community and their land he cites reports of native peoples who used the word i when speaking of their group and others who see their land as an extension of their self so that being forced away from their land would be tantamount to death this is why native peoples are often prepared to commit suicide rather than leave their lands 
the naming practices of certain peoples suggest this too for us a name is a permanent label which defines our individuality and autonomy but australian aborigines for example do not have fixed names which they keep throughout their lives their names regularly change and include those of other members of their tribe other native peoples use tekonyms terms which describe the relationship between two people instead of personal or kinship names 
the sense of separateness seems to be a quirk of our psychological development for us it slowly develops as we move into adolescence becoming firmly established in our late teens the ego develops as a structure creating a sense of innerness and walling us off 
witness the massive change which occurs when a child enters adolescence especially with boys the freshness and joy of childhood gives way to dullness and confusion after being a part of the glorious flow of experience were suddenly outside the world alone inside our own mental space this is why adolescents have such a strong need for belonging 
their new sense of separation makes them feel so vulnerable that they need to reinforce their identity by being a part of groups or gangs or by following fashions more bleakly this is also why most murders are committed by young men in response to perceived slights or insults with their new fragile sense of identity young men are liable to take offence at any kind of trivial affront making them feel belittled and creating an instant desire to take revenge and regain their lost status 
i remember this transition clearly from my own adolescence after a carefree childhood i suddenly felt locked inside myself alone with thoughts and feelings which no one else would ever be able to experience along with that i felt an acute selfconsciousness i was aware of every movement i made and every word i spoke so that i couldnt do anything naturally anymore i felt exposed when i walked down the street aware that people could have been looking at me from their windows 
as they grow into adulthood most people deal with the fragility and vulnerability of the self by taking on roles and attachments they take on the roles of their jobs attach themselves to certain beliefs strengthening their identity with labels such as socialists atheists or muslims or attach themselves to ambitions to knowledge theyve accumulated to their selfimage as important or powerful people or emotionally attach themselves to other people these roles and attachments become the scaffolding of the ego propping it up and at the same time they reinforce separation making the individual walled off awakening from the sleep of separateness 
however no matter how far into separateness we fall in a sense its never more than superficial no matter how strong the ego becomes its never more than a construct everyone experiences moments when separateness temporarily fades and we become part of the unity again these are what i refer to as awakening experiences they frequently occur when were walking amongst natural surroundings when were dancing or running during or after sex listening to or playing music in these situations the normal chattering of the ego which is the normal fuel of the ego maintaining it as a structure becomes quiet leading to a softening of its boundaries separateness dissolves and were afloat on the ocean of being again immersed in the glorious isness and aliveness of the world 
tellingly in these moments there is always an identity shift we feel that weve become someone else a deeper more grounded self which seems more authentically you the egoself we identified with before seems like an imposter a limited and shallow trickster who somehow deluded us into thinking it was our identity 
there are also many cases of extreme loss or intense turmoil when all of the egos building blocks its roles and attachments are broken away a person might be diagnosed with cancer and told they only have a few months left to live an alcoholic might reach rock bottom and be on the point of suicide a person might become seriously disabled through injury or illness or they might suffer from the trauma of bereavement depression the destruction of hopes and beliefs and so on in most cases these forms of loss simply bring sadness and suffering but for a minority of individuals they can trigger a spiritual awakening with all its scaffolding broken down the normal egoself dissolves away and our deeper truer self emerges in its place like a butterfly from a caterpillar the person feels reborn like a different person inhabiting the same body with a new sense of meaning and connection 
in all of these experiences there is a sense of coming home back to our original oneness the harmony which both as an individual and as a species we fell away from it was always there it is always here its just that our separate selves deluded us into thinking we were asleep

originally published by the jerusalem post  
prime minister benjamin netanyahus upcoming trips to australia singapore kazakhstan and azerbaijan might be the most significant diplomatic visits he makes in his tenure in office the trips will take place against the backdrop of two major international shifts that cast israel into uncharted waters as a small state with a dizzying array of strategic threats arrayed against it the states that he will visit are all wellpositioned to help israel navigate its next moves the first shift is the uss political crackup 
next week american voters will choose their next president the major candidates democratic nominee hillary clinton and republican nominee donald trump are the weakest candidates to have ever stood for the highest office in the land their rise is a testament to the weakening if not the unraveling of the glue that has held america together since the civil war the unraveling of the us electorate comes against the backdrop of the diminution of us military power the uss multitrillion dollar investment in inconclusive if not failed wars in the middle east over the past  years has come at the expense of military modernization the f program has sucked up the majority of the remaining research and development funds and it has yet to produce a reliable airplane worse the fs long and problematic gestation period has given russia and china the time and opportunity to develop air defense systems capable of neutralizing the fs stealth systems those systems were supposed to be its chief advantage as the next generation fighter for the us and its allies the deterioration of the uss military capabilities has gone hand in hand with the uss apparent loss of strategic rationality this is apparent worldwide but is nowhere more obvious than in the middle east president barack obamas decision to effectively abandon the uss major allies in the middle east in favor of cultivating ties with iran has made the region far more dangerous to the us and its spurned allies than it was eight years ago true in theory obamas decision to prefer the shiites to the sunnis makes sense given the totalitarian and imperial nature of sunni jihadism but in light of the genocidal totalitarian and imperial nature of the current iranian regime his move made no sense and its impact has been massively destructive moreover obamas willingness to rack up the uss national debt in an unprecedented manner and repress economic growth through overregulation has left a large question mark over the possibility of a military buildup in other words even under the best circumstances it is hard to imagine that the us will be capable of reestablishing its global primacy over the next four years or even over the next decade the implications for israel are far reaching for decades israels strategic posture has been predicated on its ability to depend on us power this strategic posture is no longer tenable the second major international shift is russias sudden rise as the primary global power in the middle east as channel  reported sunday night russia has deployed sophisticated naval and air systems in the region that can detect all of israels air and naval operations in a matter of months israel has lost the air and naval supremacy it has enjoyed for the past four decades the air force reportedly is convinced that the fs stealth systems will be able to neutralize russias detection capabilities but given the welldocumented current problems with the fs stealth systems this conviction is unwise and even under the best circumstances in which israel has the opportunity to develop its own electronic warfare systems and apply them to its f without american interference it will take israel years to surmount the challenge that rapidly improving russian systems present to our air force according to channel s report air force and naval commanders are in a panic over the sudden turn of events rather than panicking though israel needs to roll with the punches and figure out how best to cope with this new situation the obvious answer is that we need to quickly expand our capabilities in areas that russias military primacy does not reach specifically israel needs to expand massively its capacity for undertheradar operations the first area that needs to be massively strengthened is our intelligence capabilities particularly human intelligence capabilities israel should be investing massively in developing and expanding our cultivation and direction of proxies on the ground throughout the region second israel needs to adapt its cyber technology capabilities in a manner that diminishes our enemies ability to strike us israel needs to be able to disrupt and disable command and control and other systems israels reach needs to extend as low down the line of its enemies military chain of command as possible if our offensive capabilities are being checked so must the capabilities of our enemies indeed our enemies need to be subverted part of the intelligence and cyber capabilities that israel must develop and deploy must be geared toward destabilizing with the goal of overthrowing the regime in iran at the same time israel should be empowering antiregime sectors in iran in a manner that expands the prospect of developing close ties with a successor regime along the lines of the strategic alliance israel built with the regime of the shah in the decades which preceded the  islamic revolution third israel needs to expand and diversify the capabilities of our ground forces israel needs to be capable of using new means to deploy its fighters at home and on distant shores it needs to align its both its special and regular forces with the new threat environment and it needs to be able to utilize its ground forces in manners that can extend the reach and diminish the compromised positions of its air and naval assets in the era of russian regional primacy fourth israel needs to expand its economic growth and diversify its economic ties in a manner that positions it as a regional economic power it needs to use it natural gas resources specifically as a means to expand and deepen its ties with asia such economic growth and power will positively influence russias willingness to allow israel to carry out air and naval operations against its enemies  and russias allies in lebanon syria and beyond in other words the more economically powerful israel is the more russia will be willing to side with israel against hezbollah and others that are currently operating under the russian umbrella this then brings us to netanyahus upcoming trips each state that he will visit has something to offer israel in expanding its intelligence cyberwarfare and economic capabilities australia a major western economy is moving toward china as america has become less engaged in the pacific israel has an acute interest in using australia as a platform for expanding its ties to china and other asian countries both because of the economic advantages such ties convey and due to chinas strategic importance to russia as for singapore israel effectively built the singaporean military in the s and s the country remains extremely supportive of israel like australia singapore has close ties to china it has technological and other capabilities that can be extremely advantageous for israel today azerbaijan and kazakhstan are critically important to israel today their strategic proximity to iran and their ties to russia along with their ethnic composition and their natural resources make securing good relations with both critical to israels ability to advance and security its strategic interests in every sphere israel has tremendous assets to offer each of the four countries that netanyahu will visit these assets must be deployed wisely to ensure that israel gains as much as possible from his trip and from its future ties with all of them given the dramatic changes in the global power balance and their implications for israel netanyahus decision to fly to visit these four countries just after the us

the buzz aldrin syndrome is where a man achieves such greatness such accomplishments in life that he is truly unrivaled and peerless while exhilarating at first perhaps even earning one fame riches and fortune the success also unintentionally alienates the person from the rest of society at the time buzz aldrin only had three or four other astronauts who he could really talk to confide in and relate to the remaining  billion people on the planet at the time were just starstruck wideeyed sheep alas buzz aldrin could be surrounded by scores of fans at a party but still be completely alone mentally 
the syndrome is also exacerbated as ones pinnacle achievements in life are likely correlated with retirement you typically progress in your career right up until the day you retire however here you leave the environment and network youve come accustomed thrived in and derived your entire agency from thus in a very short period of time you go from the center of attention the life of the party the engine of the machineto a retiree in california drinking scotch and eating kfc longing for the days you could go back to the office again without the environment you derived all your worth and value from you lose purpose in life you lose mental stimulation you lose your peers and very likely sink into a crippling depression the perfect storm 
there are seven factors that when combined create the perfect storm for the buzz aldrin syndrome to form and most rok readers either have these traits are affected by them  technological advancements 
technology has always advanced but in this particular case it affects us in two specific ways making living expenses cheaper and allowing for more and easier ways to make money 
as opposed to the s most of a mans life was spent toiling in the field he didnt have time to contemplate loftier or heavier subjects much like the purpose of life what is mans reason for being etc you had to worry about the plague tetanus your wife dying in labor and whether thered be enough crops to survive the coming winter but today through economics capitalism agricultural technology etc a single man can basically eat for nearfree at walmart or the local grocery store 
technology has also freed us from work not so much from the fact we have to work but in terms of how much time we need to spend on it in order to survive no more than a decade ago a young man had to work  hours a week  for a commute and likely for an inept baby boomer boss who was never going to let you get past the cubicle plantation now with the internet not only can a man give the proverbial finger to rush hour and a commute but his boss as well making whatever minimalistic modicum of money he needs to survive through online entrepreneurship in short it has never been easier to satisfy maslows first three and vital hierarchy of needs freeing a mans mind to pursue his own excellence not to mention ponder his point and purpose in being here  minimalism 
it is no secret that red pill men practice or at least pursue minimalism we know that material things do not matter as it is the love and friendship from our fellow man friends family and loved ones that matter most you know that it would be nice to have that shelby super snake mustang but youd never trade it in for a lifetime of conversations and cigars with your best friend additionally we value our freedom above all else and refuse to subjugate ourselves to becoming debt slaves by buying things we plain dont need 
jettisoning these material desires liberates more of our finite lives from work and a commute to once again pursue our passions our fields our adventures and our lives in simply refusing to buy a mcmansion and take on a car loan we guarantee we will live more interesting and rewarding lives than  of our peers  avoiding divorce and unwanted children 
further saving us more time is the disproportionate number of us refusing to have children or marry in fear of divorce and for those of us who do marry we are fully aware of what to look for more or less immunizing us from divorce  knowledge of women 
to be blunt and honestly assess the good the manosphere and red pill community have done we have saved the lives of millions of young men and prevented older ones from wasting what remains of theirs if i were to estimate it every boy born today will save at least a decade of time that would have otherwise been wasted at nightclubs chasing tail dating the wrong girls and perhaps even marrying the wrong ones 
being a product of the s i have often talked with my gen x peers where we estimated what we could have done had we not wasted the s and s chasing women we were either never going to get or would regret catching we could have easily had doctorates houses built by our own hands much better careers not to mention better mental health as we would have avoided all the batshit insane women we sifted through young men today especially those who consume the red pill will easily have a decade of time on us by simply learning from our mistakes   selfimprovement 
unless you are in the virgintow community you know how important selfimprovement is to a mans life you have this one finite life on this planet and not only is it imperative you enjoy it but you must ensure it is a masterpiece of art in whatever endeavors you choose to excel in this may not land you on the moon but you will achieve greatness and excellence in some capacity or another music literature innovation philosophy being a good dad something you will not idly stand by sitting on your ass majoring in sociology or collecting a welfare check as you knock up baby mama after baby momma you will be notable and leave a positive legacy on this world  entrepreneurship or stem 
most of you know not to major in stupid worthless shit  you also know that for the majority of us entrepreneurship or selfemployment is the only form of employment that we can tolerate because of this two things will happen in your life one you will save an inordinate amount of time spent trying to make a go at a career that just isnt in demand in the real world you will work as an engineer a programmer a doctor or some real professiontrade which will not only pay you a handsome wage but make your life incredibly easier two at some point in time you will come up with an idea that will either cement your success in your career or outright launch a successful entrepreneurial endeavor this will free you from your dependence on traditional employers ensure your financial future is sound but it will also likely lead towards you achieving your legacy in excellence 
in the veritable sea of liberal arts majors not one of their millions will ever make anything of themselves they will simply waste away doubling down on masters degrees and doctorates in their hopelessly worthless fields worse they will be crippled until death with student loans and inadequate compensation as they beg and vote for other peoples money they will die like most unmentionable irrelevant and forgotten 
you will not  a high intelligence 
to make all of this a reality you need the raw intellectual capacity to bring this to fruition while no studies have been done if you have the independent mindedness to be reading rok id estimate the average iq of rok readers to be  however keep in mind while being highly intelligent is an asset it is also a curse  like rok you are on the fringe and because of that you are not only going to receive an inordinate amount of flak from the rest of normie society but relating to the rest of it let alone finding a healthy and rewarding social life in it is going to prove next to impossible 
when you combine these traits and conditions you have what is arguably the perfect environment for a great life to form you need very little to survive because you wont waste your resources on frivolous material things in life you also have very little liabilities or responsibilities not only because youre a minimalist but are likely not going to marry or have children the lions share of your time and energies can be dedicated towards achieving excellence and greatness in your life 
and if youve done it right youll be two decades ahead of your gen x peers since you avoided worthless degrees and leapfrogged your philosophical understanding of life you will be accomplished you will be successful you will have paid a fraction of the mental toll to get there and you will indeed be an amazing man the worlds most interesting perhaps you have reached the so called finish line much earlier and faster than buzz aldrin 
and thats when your real problems start you werent meant to be here 
understand that while the goal of man was to secure unlimited food resources and security so that he may pursue an unlimited and happy life the human mind has no experience being here the entire existence of humankind has been struggle suffering fighting and striving for such a life but also   of the time failing  and over the course of human history the human brain has had  million years experience and conditioning in failure not success 
this leads to an ironic and perhaps the most tragic instances in human experiences a man finally gets what he wants wealth health success excellence legacy everything but upon attaining it he cant enjoy it because the human mind is not programmed to he not only realizes this rare success doesnt result in happiness or a perpetual lifelong glee that will see him to his grave but theres nothing left to conquer theres nothing left to do the game of life is over and like red dead redemption it gets mighty boring just riding your horse around after you conquer the game 
worse because of the unique characteristics required to attain this excellence any man lucky enough to be this successful is in one way or another ostracized from the rest of his peers professionally romantically intellectually some way or another to be in that   you have to be a statistical freak alas you get to suffer the true symptoms of the buzz aldrin syndrome 
peerlessness  while your friends are pumping out children or your colleagues are trying to get out from underneath their mcmansion mortgage and impending divorce you may be avoiding these dreaded fates but you are also alone no longer are these the college days where your intellectual peers in equal lifecircumstances can hang out chat philosophize and in numbers that seem endless slowly but surely they will get picked off like german messerschmitts in wwii by the forces of life and you will be left alone 
understand this has nothing to do with your pursuit of greatness or achieving excellence in life but is outside of your control as these people fall within the bell distribution curve of averageness they choose these lives meaning its not the statistical freak leaving them but them leaving the statistical freak no matter how loudly they claimed in college they were going to live life differently and dont think that you can simply recoup your former social life by joining them by being average putting on a sports jersey ordering some buffalo wild wings cheering on the local sportsball team your mind wont tolerate it 
you are peerless get used to it 
boredom  without people you get bored no matter how intelligent you are you are still human and humans are indeed social creatures as they derive their entire life value from others not things but the paradox those suffering from the buzz aldrin syndrome face is that while you would like to be social with people the vast majority of people are either too common too stupid or just too boring especially when compared to being by yourself 
go to that same buffalo wild wings to hear loud drunk divorced swpl men in their s cheer on the local swingystick team 
or read marcus aurelius  
go to a movie where jason bourne discovers another mole in the ciaagainwho set up his fatheragainwhere he drives around europe shooting the place upagain 
or binge on some history podcasts  
i know how about you go to a party where youll hear the same conversations from men about the sportsball game they just saw at buffalo wild wings as they lament their inability to get out from underneath their mortgage while the wives gossip about their painfully pointless governmentmakework careers while talking about how great the cake is 
or road trip out west and do some hiking in the desert 
the larger point is not only are the vast majority of people not intellectually stimulating enough but good luck finding enough of them who have the freedom and finances to do anything besides hit up happy hour when wifey lets them out of the house 
and then theres 
frustration  being unencumbered by the daily scourge of chores children finances mortgages and commutes your mind will be unshackled to pursue whatever intellectual pursuits it wishes to pursue youll solve world problems in an afternoon that politicians are taking eons to not solve youll come up with some and many viable business ideas discarding most of them because you have not the time to put them all into execution youll see the obvious solutions to making your friends and love ones lives infinitely better but theyll have the horseblinders on so tight theyll ignore your wisdom or youll make a great scientific discovery at work while your boss dismisses it away and threatens to fire you for having an independent thought it is simply the real world telling you you dont control everything and matter of fact most of this world was not meant for you 
obviously you can see where depression alcoholism and ennui set in you can see where the pursuit and successful attainment of excellence in life can lead to unintentional alienation and ostracization from the rest of society and since society is where all humans  geniuses or not successful or not  get their value you can see the downside to zooming past the finish line of life especially at increasingly earlier ages as technology and minimalism permit it 
the solution is in part to find quality people who can be lifelong friends colleagues peers and comrades perhaps even get married if you find the right girl and no matter what keep yourself and your mind occupied hobbies interests pursuits etc inactivity is death but ultimately what is going to best prepare you for whats coming is to simply know its coming 
nirvana and heaven are not at the other side of that finish line an active and rewarding social life full of close friends and loved ones are the not the reward for success and it certainly isnt a lifelong party until you die it is a mentallybarren landscape much like the moon a place buzz has been to both literally and metaphorically",returnofkings.com,Real,english,99.2,82.22642928926737,98,12,17079,3008,4.649268617021277,3008.0,1.101948457267672,0.3616742515005802,3.7305141045953425,3.937628965084965,-0.4340922410295011,4.041286604787894,0.0016622340425531,0.0,0.0009973404255319,0,1,0.0,0.0030915328389744,0.9998,0.172,0.118,0.71,Positive,Very Strong

us republican presidential nominee donald trump will win the november  election says an american professor who has correctly predicted almost every presidential election in the united states 
professor helmut norpoth of new yorks suny stony brook university said his model shows trump performed comparatively better in the primaries so he will triumph next month the independent reported on thursday 
norpoth developed a model which when applied retroactively successfully predicted every presidential election in the united states since  all but one which was the  election when it said democratic nominee al gore would beat republican candidate george w bush but instead bush won the election 
al gore won the popular vote but bush was awarded more votes in the electoral college following a disputed result in florida so bush was declared winner 
the political scientists model suggests that the person who emerges as the strongest candidate in the primaries will go on to win the presidency 
i think he was the strongest candidate in the primaries and that he will prevail professor norpoth told the new york post  
the model predicted a trump win in february and nothing has changed since then whatever happens in the real world doesnt affect the model he stated us democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton professor of political science at stony brook helmut norpoth new york 
recent polls show that democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton clintons national lead over trump is shrinking as election day is approaching 
the former secretary of state has the support of  percent of likely voters while the billionaire businessman has  percent support according to the cnnorc survey released on monday 
in addition preliminary figures suggest the us presidential race remains tight in socalled swing states despite boasting by clintons campaign that she is far ahead

trump has also potential advantages of his own in some battleground states

 i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system  
 hillary clinton 
the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy 
those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition ms clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however was representative of this tactic 
while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president and the lgbt community accounts for less than  percent of the american population clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress 
womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion even lateterm abortion which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values primarily christians leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the us at least not at present however judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result 
let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties rather than allowing it to perform its designated function the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see despite being conveniently ignored by the press 
clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization citizens united was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy clinton is quite wealthy and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark unaccountable money the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america someone with whom the clintons also have a long association 
one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power are fundamentally malignant 
in recent days weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign the democratic national committee and the white house 
the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality what all americans  not just voters and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and yes even vote for their candidates 
the burning question is this in the end are we to be governed by the will of the people or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government

when judith gait met father x it was a lopsided grief that drew them together he had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago gait is a married mother of five and longterm american resident in britain her support of the prolife movement is driven by thankfulness and praise for life and her christian faith 
witnessing abortions heavy toll on the living and dead gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing subtle and working entirely with symbolism these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion rather they mourn in color symbol and tone with single shoes broken cord dead flowers and other lonely and broken things troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x 
when a friend first visited gaits studio he was struck by her abortion paintings confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child he wrote i realize your work comes from a place of great love for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture 
gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child it happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby five years to the day father x remembers every detail 
their conversation grew into a joint effort culminating in a book  troubadours sailing hibiscus seas meditations on post abortion trauma  father x wanted to remain anonymous as a placesetter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion he wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of gaits  paintings in this book which have also been shown together in art exhibits 
time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion gait claims rather the past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence guilt and remorse has not abated you can see that in the words of father x which run the gamut of human emotions on abortion shoe pot and crossesfrom troubadours sailing hibiscus seas

 troubadours  runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities this includes moonlighting for angels celestial games interstellar windjammers and a baby steamer sailing on childrens seas among other delightful prospects lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their limbos 
father x occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters these are not theological statements but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion 
in gaits pink rose and stardust we see empty fields withered plants and other tokens father x takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children he places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles which is reflected in the painting children are disfigured or missing eyes or arms and singing in low mournful tones so as not to disturb their parents music is intense equivalent to the sound created by hildegard von bingen a thcentury nun and composer troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x

postabort guilt isnt rationalized or downplayed but emotionally reacted to in art and word father x describes bats as whirling about in circles at the pitiful sound the aborted children make because they are tuned to such distressing signals this contrasts with many parents who are still stone deaf to such mournful sounds at another point fatherx imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus a roar of unwanted thoughts troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x 
father x elaborates on what gait hints in her paintings the injustice and evil of abortion he cites a world built on slavery before christs advent and the works of such men as william wilberforce and john brown in furthering christs gospel of justice and peace all this is contrasted to abortion throughout 
ruminating on gaits palms of our lord father x claims the face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion palms is murky with a single red hand print to look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the tarot of ruins he continues 
suicide advances this dark theme where gait and father x criticize the death industry and its euphemistically named clinics he takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings  a caricature of a woman who made a mistake who got herself in trouble who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart 
but all isnt baleful and sad here in cloud children father x muses on paper dolls in gaits paintings with this lovely thought where children go  is a mystery  some say they take their daytime rest in christs tomb in jerusalem and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled star ships 
 troubadours sailing hibiscus seas  is a work of meditation grief counseling poetry social commentary and visual art father x may not reveal his identity here but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child gait and father x describe their efforts as a silent prayer of witness for all the ghost families those phantoms of sorrows who will never laugh or cry together as a family because of an abortion they hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way

for some people fishing is a long boring day of sitting and staring endlessly at a rod and reel that may never get a bite but what if you could get down with those mocking waterbreathers and have highnoon shootout with them the way nature intended 
well thats just what some florida boys thought when they decided to take their modified glock mm pistol into the gulf of mexico to help deal with the infestation of lionfish 
thesickest provides some more details on the lionfish overpopulation problem and the boys creative way to address it 
lionfish are an invasive species with no natural predators whos females lay a staggering two million eggs a year the intersection between ammunitionhappy americans and the determent of an overpopulated species is where the the use of this new sporting phenomenon was birthed 
lionsfish were never intended to be in the gulf of mexico and while its speculated that their transplant may be linked to a hurricanes back in the s because of their rapid reproductive nature the waters have become flooded by their presence 
a single lionsfish consumes  reefs edible baitfish within five weeks of arriving on that reef  incredibly damaging to plant that is the cornerstone of the underwater ecosystem the issue has gotten to a point where entering the florida coast at any time can mean running across thousands of lionsfish just posted up chilling 
the good news is that the introduction of the gun has the potential of bringing hunters and otherwise uninterested fishers to the gulf for a fun filled time of shooting underwater an activity that actually looks like a blast 
the video below shows just how fun it can be 


shooting invasive lionfish over ft underwater with customized glock mm handgun in the gulf of mexico the video description states the project started to see if we could shoot a gun underwater and it evolved into much more with the right people involved lionfish are an invasive species that need to be eradicated all weapons modifications done under supervision of airborne arms inc license holder manufacturer of firearms other than destructive devices with support of lone wolf glock parts wwwlonewolfdistcom

No Author,trump hillary clinton may be most corrupt person ever to run for president,"email 
the second presidential debate flew off the rails on sunday night when donald trump invoked accusations of sexual misconduct against bill clinton and suggested that hillary clinton could be in jail if hes elected in november threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to look into her private email server 

abcs martha raddatz one of the debate moderators asked trump whether his behavior exposed in the shocking  video released friday in which he bragged about groping and kissing women without permission was consistent with his current behavior 
as i told you that was lockerroom talk trump said i am not proud of it i am a person who has great respect for people for my family for people of this country and im not proud of it 
trump then said if you look at the history of politics in this country no one had been so abusive of women as former president bill clinton the husband of the democratic nominee whom trump suggested intimidated those women 
three women who had previously accused bill clinton of sexual misconduct held a press conference with trump earlier sunday and each was seated in the front row at the debate 
mine were words  his were actions trump said 
so dont tell me about words he continued i am absolutely i apologize for those words but it is things that people say bill clinton he was impeached he was no longer allowed to practice law he had to pay an  fine to one of the women paula jones who is here tonight that when hillary brings up a point like that brings up words i say  years ago i think its disgraceful and i think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth

i am reminded of what my friend michelle obama advised us all she said when they go low you go high 
and look if this were just about one video maybe what hes saying tonight would be understandable she said but everyone can come to their own conclusions about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women but he never apologizes to anyone for anything 
she mentioned that trump had not apologized to the khans a couple who lost a son a muslim us soldier during the iraq war trump engaged in a lengthy backandforth with the khans after they appeared at the democratic national convention in july 
clinton also said trump had not apologized to a reporter whose disability he mocked in front of a camera a federal judge who trump said couldnt do his job fairly because he was of mexican descent and president barack obama whose birthplace trump tried to discredit in a multiyear campaign 
he owes the president an apology he needs to apologize to our country and he needs to take responsibility she said 
trump responded by repeating the false claim that the clinton campaign started the rumors casting doubt on obamas birthplace in  he added that she owed an apology for the  emails you deleted 
if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation trump said because there have never been so many lies so much deception and were going to have a special prosecutor 
clinton said everything trump said was absolutely false but she was not surprised 
oh really trump interjected

No Author,charlotte area counties report voting machines picking wrong candidates,"email 

an email published by wikileaks on friday reveals the extent to which democrats and their allies manipulate polls to serve their ends 
the  email appears shows democratic operatives plotting to intentionally oversample seniors in a poll in order to get their desired results 
fyi we are going to try to do an oversample of seniors on the poll sample too small otherwise operative tom matzzie wrote to clinton adviser paul begala campaign chairman john podesta media matters for america founder david brock and operative susan mccue good begala responded 
trump and his supporters have claimed often that many polls showing a significant hillary lead over trump have been manipulated through selective sampling there is ample evidence that this occurs in democratfriendly newsrooms 
hillary clinton has opened up a point lead over donald trump in an online poll that seems to reflect a bounce for the former secretary of state after she wrapped up the democratic nomination last week the daily mail reported in june 
but the weekly tracking poll from nbc news and the surveymonkey company included the opinions of  percent more selfidentified democrats than republicans  the same margin as the polls topline result the article noted 
the email released by wikileaks friday proves that democratic operatives themselves engage eagerly in such tactics 
polls are a powerful propaganda tool and people exposed repeatedly to polls suggesting their candidates loss is a foregone conclusion will often be influenced to stay home on election day

press tv 
experts say the outlook for saudi economic recovery will remain murky for many months to come with some even warning that the worst of the economic slump for the kingdom is yet to come 
reuters in a report quoted several riyadhbased experts as saying that there would be a high degree of uncertainty over the status of the saudi economy in  that would mainly be a result of the remaining challenges from the private sector 
the saudi economy may appear to have escaped a fiscal and currency crisis that loomed at the start of  however experts said threats from certain basic problems still remain and will haunt the kingdom next year 
the government owes its success to temporarily escape crisis to unpaid bills rather than sustainable spending cuts 
the government has reduced or suspended payments that it owed to construction firms medical establishments and even some of the foreign consultants who helped to design the economic reforms reuters added quoting the experts the estimated unpaid dues for construction firms alone totaled  billion riyals 
experts further warned that this could store up obligations for riyadh in the future 
reuters elsewhere emphasized that signs of the economic slump could be seen in riyadh and other major cities where discounts of  percent or more are offered by stores selling clothes and consumer electronics and there is a surge in people offering secondhand cars for sale 
the biggest uncertainty may be how authorities can push through a key part of their reform drive added the report the most important issue for the saudis may be determining how they plan to foster a vibrant private sector that does not depend on oil revenues while at the same pushing ahead austerity policies that are suppressing private demand 
experts also warned that the status of the saudi job market over the next few years between  million and  million of saudi arabias  million foreign workers may leave over the next couple of years as the economic slowdown causes layoffs and the government seeks to steer saudi citizens into jobs previously held by foreigners reuters added",amtvmedia.com,Fake,english,16.496481406625215,12.22722258602208,38,7,2154,357,4.985994397759104,357.0,-0.7325539033172883,-0.5778293249656962,-0.2182180629654616,-0.2182928093741662,-0.1017769183580895,-0.211798990503248,0.0084033613445378,0.0,0.0028011204481792,0,2,0.0,0.0188366829019954,-0.9846,0.037,0.124,0.839,Negative,Very Strong

good morning its tuesday 
whos up for another silly attempt to claim that hillary clinton is only being investigated for her rogue email setup because shes a woman this gem comes from robin lakoff a berkeley professor in sustained incoherence and special pleading 
hillary clintons emailgate is an attack on women 
its not about emails its about public communication by a woman 
i am mad i am mad because i am scared and if you are a woman you should be too emailgate is a bitch hunt but the target is not hillary clinton its us 
the only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female can you imagine this happening to a man 
his name was general petraeus thank you have a nice day 
clinton is guilty of swf speaking while female and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what shes doing and must be punished for the sake of all decent women everywhere there is so much of that going around 
that escalated quickly and incoherently also im pretty sure its not the s or whatever decade robin is parodying or channeling but yes hillary clinton is only in this mess because shes a woman it has nothing to do with anything else that must be why albright and rice werent in the center of similar scandals 
if the candidate were male there would be no scolding and no scandal those very ideas would be absurd men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech in theory so do women but that as the creationists like to say is only a theory 
emailing classified information on your server to avoid transparency regulations is not free speech its illegal for both public officials of both genders 
but heres hillary rodham clinton the very public standin for all bossy uppity and ambitious women here are her emails and since its a woman doing what decent women should never doengaging in highlevel public communicationwell there must be something wrong with that even if we cant quite find that something

i am honored to be considered for that job and other jobs so well see what happens ingraham said on fox news

its a big decision but im at the point where if my country needs me and if i can do something to actually you know advance the trump agenda which is stuff i have written about now for  years with trade immigration and just renewing america then i obviously have to seriously consider that she told foxs tucker carlson

Bob Smith,hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts,"why we are still in the danger zone until january th    th  
donald trump is not the president yet and barack obama could still do an extraordinary amount of damage during his last two months in the white house prior to the election i described the period of time ending on january th as the danger zone and my outlook has not changed just because donald trump was victorious on election night as you will see the next two months are an absolutely critical time and if we can get through january th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier at least for a while on the other hand the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos a lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of trumps victory but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard 
and the truth is that donald trump has not even won the presidency yet as i detailed shortly before election night  the next president will not be determined until december th when the electoral college meets 
on monday december th the members of the electoral college will gather in all  state capitals to cast their votes for president it is then and only then that the next president of the united states will be elected 
throughout our history electors have followed the will of the people more than  perfect of the time but there have been faithless electors before and if democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in december it is still possible though not probable that hillary clinton could win the election 
one petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than  million people the petition claims that donald trump is unfit to serve as president and that since hillary clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead the following comes from a usa today article entitled  could the electoral college elect hillary clinton instead of donald trump  
a changeorg petition now signed by more than  million people encourages members of the electoral college to cast their votes for hillary clinton when the college meets on dec  the petition argues that donald trump is unfit to serve and that secretary clinton won the popular vote and should be president 
if they all vote the way their states voted donald trump will win the petition states however they can vote for hillary clinton if they choose even in states where that is not allowed their vote would still be counted they would simply pay a small fine  which we can be sure clinton supporters will be glad to pay we are calling on the electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for secretary clinton 
personally i dont believe that this is going to happen they may be able to flip a few electors but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the democrats to overcome 
however that is not the only concern we are facing ever since his victory on november th there have been a multitude of violent threats against donald trump and his family and without a doubt there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep donald trump from getting to inauguration day so let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family 
if donald trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the electoral college vote on december th mike pence would take his place 
but if something were to happen to him before december th his electors would be free to vote for another candidate  including hillary clinton 
if everything goes smoothly and donald trump successfully makes it to inauguration day he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in united states history 
in an article for the most important news  i showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon washington dc on january th in order to disrupt the inauguration festivities as much as possible 
this giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects and they have already put up facebook pages  websites  and the hashtag disruptj is being widely used all over social media 
traditionally inauguration day is a day of joy and celebration but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot 
let us hope that they are not successful 
another reason why we will be in the danger zone over the next two months is because of what barack obama may choose to do at the united nations 
now that it looks like donald trump is going to be our next president the international pressure on barack obama to do something at the united nations regarding the israelipalestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense 
and this is something that trump and his advisers are actively concerned about in fact i came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the trump team is warning obama against making moves on the israelipalestinian conflict in his last months in office  
saying that pushing agendas contrary to the presidentelects position would not be in the spirit of the transition trump national security advisor for donald trump last week warned the obama administration against making moves on the israelipalestinian conflict in his last months in office 
on big transformative issues where president obama and presidentelect trump are not in alignment i dont think its in keeping with the spirit of the transitionto try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the presidentelects positions the advisor told politico  
specifically the concern is that obama may decide to support a un security council resolution that would officially recognize a palestinian state set the parameters for a two state solution and establish east jerusalem as the capital for the new palestinian state 
just a few weeks ago an article in the wall street journal entitled  obamas israel surprise  reported that this is one of the options that the obama administration is strongly considering right now a un security council resolution would be legally binding on both israel and the palestinians and it would be something that president trump would not be able to undo 
the rest of the un security council is eager to support such a resolution and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of barack obama and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do the following comes from an article by leo hohmann  
the wall street journal reported one week before tuesdays election that obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decadesold israelipalestinian conflict 
israeli diplomats according to the wsj story are preparing for the possibility that a lameduck president obama may try to force a diplomatic resolution for israel and the palestinians at the united nations 
the president is presumably now reviewing those options which number about half a dozen 
he may be preparing to recognize a palestinian state at the un before he leaves office  wsj reported 
if barack obama decides to divide the land of israel at the united nations it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency i have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in america if it happens and it will also mean that many of the events that i warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating 
but if we can get to january th and the land of israel has not been divided yet we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while because trump has already said that he would not support a un security council resolution that forces a solution on the israelis and palestinians 
when politicians are going to do something that they know people wont like they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people arent paying attention for example yesterday i discussed how the legislation that created the federal reserve was rushed through congress right before christmas in   
so keep an eye on the period around thanksgiving and the period around christmas if barack obama is going to stab israel in the back it may happen during one of those times 
my hope is that we can get through january th without anything going seriously wrong if that happens i know that i will be very thankful 
and as i detailed in a previous article  donald trump will be  years  months and  days old on his first full day in office on january st and that will happen in year  on the hebrew calendar 
could that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe 
or will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation 
i believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions

i am a political atheist just to set the record straight although i visit this site fairly often it is showing signs of paranoia and provoking fear when george w as elected there were many protesters they were just hidden away in free speech zones of course there are many unhappy people as there were in  and every election trumps votes were less than  of the  million people in the country will trump bring jobs no not unless they are govt employees or funded by taxes there is only one way jobs are created and that is when there is demand for products and services a lot of people with their low paying jobs can hardly afford the basic necessities let alone keep playing the consumerism game i cannot see obama doing anything that requires legislation as he is lame duck status now perhaps this site needs to focus on the swamp getting filled with more careerists especially lobbyists i have been an expat for over  years it is a lovely peaceful warm day here think i will go for a bicycle ride then a dip in  degree seawater i do have faith that not much will change and the sun will continue to rise even when it is obscured by clouds peace and loveit is the only way df nj 
obamas big political move will be to appoint an ultra liberal judge to the bench during the recess i just cant imagine that he doesnt leave office without punishing the republicans for not taking garland and given all the threats to taking away all of obamas legacy this is the only thing left he has to make his mark on history rick 
i dont think he can do that with a phone and pen sorry heyahuman

yes there is still a possibility that hillary clinton could still get in the oval office but a trump presidency is pretty much a done deal knock on wood the secret service had better guard him and his family very closely from what ive seen and heard president obama is trying to make trumps transition to the presidency very peaceful and orderly even though they hate each other lets hope that trumps presidency will be a successful one and that it heals the many divisions and other issues that plague our country back in  i bought a brand new book called the art of the deal at my college bookstore it was written by some guy named donald trump yes i actually did read it df nj 
not a chance hillary is dead and gone mondobeyondo

the liberty tree is getting mighty thirstyjust saying df nj 
there are many forms of freedom you criticize the left but you just dont understand it heres how the left thinks 
an old english judge once said necessitous men are not free men liberty requires opportunity to make a living  a living decent according to the standard of the time a living which gives man not only enough to live by but something to live for 
for too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality a small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other peoples property other peoples money other peoples labor  other peoples lives for too many of us life was no longer free liberty no longer real men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness 
against economic tyranny such as this the american citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government  
you many not agree with this approach but all the evidence shows wealth inequality is at all time highs most of you right wingers claim we have too much socialism and communism in this country the sad fact is we cannot be further way from communism and still have a currency with any shred of value 
but do not fear every year the top  become richer and richer every year the middle class is driven deeper and deeper into poverty wages marx said laissez faire capitialism is always followed by communism because unfettered greed would result in a governments currency collapse once the currency collapses people in bread lines will demand more government not less

anything is possible in the next two months and with the huge amounts of  invested into continuing an evil empire the underworldshadow gov will use any and all means to make their plans come to fruition

Letsbereal,no title,"home this month popular  tips for having sex with croatian girls  tips for having sex with croatian girls february    comments travel day game 
 croatian girls are extremely receptive to day game they want to be opened even if she has headphones and seems focused on her music it can still go well same goes for girls on rollerblades excuse me where can i buy rollerblades like yours 
 croatia is one of those places where both indirect and direct game work pick one that suits the venue and your personality what i did was open indirect chat for a couple minutes and then hit her with a compliment about her positive energy to see how shed respond if she smiled i knew i was in 
 girls will give you their number even if they have a boyfriend it may not come out until the first meeting to avoid this when i was getting a number id jokingly say youre not married right if she had a boyfriend she would then announce it with a guilty look on her face 
 always go for the instadate especially if youre doing street game not only will this weed out flakey girls but it gives you an opportunity to find out what she wants in life croatia has a lot of good girls who dont drink at all and want a serious relationship you want to dump those prospects if youre not staying long 
 a common issue youll find on the first date is girls who want to bring their friends along dont let them or youll get stuck in a hellish group chat its either a on date or nothing night game 
 you need to push the interaction as far as you can go if you dont at least get a kiss the odds that number will lead to a date is  or less if you get a passionate kiss with some handholding at the end over  its easy to get a number from a croatian girl but you should resist push for the kiss its similar to what you should do in america 
 absolutely do not add a croatian girl to facebook they are accomplished attention whores and will string you along if you didnt at least get a phone number you got nothing 
 cockblocking is a huge problem the best way to fight it is to be more selective about the venues you choose large clubs have the hottest girls but they are harder to approach and you will end up getting cockblocked incessantly hipster bars have the ugliest girls but youll rarely get cockblocked experiment in the city to find something in the middle that has the best balance between beauty and attitude so much of a successful croatian experience will be based on the venue going from the best venue to the worst you may even feel like youre in a different country as a general rule if youre in a club where the girls arent genuinely excited youre a foreigner you should go somewhere else 
 since so many girls go out in pairs its better to roll with a wingman than solo dolo a problem youll face if you re going out solo is that a girl doesnt want to leave her friend alone what i did was approach girls whose friend was already getting hit on by another guy 
 dont compliment at night  croatian girls already have an elevated perception of themselves and get compliments all the time they are not insecure as girls from the baltics or ukraine  
 dont call a girl before you bang her they rarely answer text instead 
 croatia is slowly embracing onenight stands with the right logistics you should be able to get them they are far easier than a place like ukraine the key here is having tight logistics it should be so tight that you can take a walk with her and be at your place to hop in for a quick drink the girls who are most likely to go for this will be  and who want a taste of the american sexual culture older women will be able to resist your logistical game 
 similar to the above point all your dates should be close to your apartment if your date venue is more than half a mile away youre already shooting yourself in the foot even if a croatian girl is playing aloof she can turn on a dime once in a private room 
 the less snobby the club the more acceptable it is to buy a girl a drink without getting punished for it croatia isnt like other eastern european countries where girls are generally upfront and honest with their intentionsthey will play you if you give them the opportunity especially the higher end venues generally speaking as long as she didnt have a bitch face when you first approached her you should be in the clear to buy a drink  
 the best game for zagreb the capital is to have the best logistics possible sadly croatian girls flake more than average so you want the proximity of your apartment to act as bait for casual hangouts that turn into bangs unless youre dealing with an older croatian girl who is into you youll have to play the numbers game and not get hung up on any one girl get ready to meet some hardcore female players 
 if you put x hours a day into day game and x hours into night game youll be rewarded with night game first you can get surprisingly fast bangs at night that day game doesnt provide mostly because aggressive night game easily screens out day girls who are simply bored but not really hankering for dick if i go back to croatia ill just move right next to a good bar",prisonplanet.com,Fake,english,20.8,8.476806513105332,8,2,5125,970,4.24020618556701,970.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,0.5678243671734429,0.7426955149349426,-0.837796743855548,0.7716568638586796,0.0030927835051546,0.0,0.0010309278350515,0,0,0.0,0.0049390881171147,0.999,0.18,0.064,0.756,Positive,Very Strong

back when i was a bluepill high school greenhorn clueless about women and with a mind set on neutral i was destined to be just another cog in the big government machine simply put i would have been the dogs bollocks 
but having all these resources served on a silver platter would not have given me the hunger that i have for life today i would take this things as granted instead of considering every opportunity as the last one 
dwelling on those thoughts is not good what i can do is to keep writing so other young people and lost men turn their life around for the better if i must condense the most useful things i have learnt on game logistics are key

Ike Mclean,missing california mother found safe on thanksgiving day,"home  news  for sale hillarys state department for sale hillarys state department fisher  mins ago news comments off on for sale hillarys state department for sale hillary s state department 
as new revelations continue to unfold regarding hillary s time as secretary of state it has become clear that her state department was highly influenced by donors to the clinton foundation before hillary became secretary of state she had to sign an agreement with the obama administration restricting the ability of the clinton foundation to accept foreign donations in february of this year the clinton foundation admitted that the agreement had in fact been broken 
now it has been discovered that over half of nongovernment officials who met with hillary while she was secretary of state gave money to the clinton foundation what they received in return is just one of the questions hillary has refused to answer byavoiding the press for the past eight months in newly released emails there are details of donors being granted access to ambassadors due to their interest in the region the foundation putting pressure on hillary s staff to hire a former employee and the clinton global initiative leader demanding a top foundation donor be connected with the state department 
this is beyond the appearance of a conflict and americans have seen through the facade a majority of voters say they believe clinton gave special treatment to foundation donors while she was secretary of state as the president of judicial watch accurately pointed out there was no daylight between the two under mrs clinton and this was contrary to her promises 
after ignoring previous ethics guidelines the clintons are now trying to reassure americans by saying the foundation will change if hillary is elected the last ditch effort to gloss over ethics violations and possibly cover up corruption within hillary s state department is much too little and far too late americans are tired of being lied to by the clintons since the american people have a right to a full view of hillary s record before they head to the polls the clinton foundation should immediately release all of hillary s state department emails",dennismichaellynch.com,Fake,english,12.27796038572514,5.755236223263406,56,8,2189,362,5.030386740331492,362.0,-0.1822031951418003,-0.3899286096724409,-0.2089580545323206,-0.2104544054238472,-0.0579660298251169,-0.2037773277433628,0.0027624309392265,0.0,0.0027624309392265,0,0,0.0,0.0048916093160612,0.1779,0.077,0.073,0.85,Positive,Weak

well donald trump certainly has cause for celebration today 
despite having a multibilliondollar net worth an international real estate company and a primetime television show donald trumps ambitions were still set higher the one trophy hed spent his entire life trying to claim for his mantle of accomplishments had always evaded himuntil today by winning the  presidential election donald trump is finally able to kick the nations most powerful black family out of their house 
one can only imagine the immense joy donalds wife and children feel for him today 
trump has been preparing for this moment ever since the trump organization first started buying buildings throughout new york city and raising rent for africanamericans until he could toss them out for no longer being able to afford it now after decades of practice and determination the presidentelect will see his magnum opus arrive in the form of booting the incredibly influential and powerful obama family out of the home theyve lived in for the past eight years 
ejecting black people from their residences has been a lifelong passion for donald from practicing discriminatory housing policies that prevented black people from moving into trump buildings to tagging black peoples rental applications with a separate sheet of paper marked c for colored donald has never lost focus on his goal but that was all just warmup for trump who clearly wanted to challenge himself by attempting to evict a wealthy black family of international renown and when he sends president obama michelle malia sasha and all their boxedup belongings packing from their house in january trump will have done just that 
what a truly stunning feat with the biggest item on his bucket list now firmly checked off trump would be more than justified in resting on his laurels to soak in the consummation of all his dreams its hard to imagine an even more powerful and famous black family donald could evict but knowing trump he will continue to push himself whatever his plans are now the world will be watching in anxious anticipation",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,124,20,2084,345,5.023188405797101,345.0,1.8968994801878212,1.8648799738466224,-0.2367380798317434,-0.2371049788549318,-0.0650700800652006,-0.2310509811269725,0.0028985507246376,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0043770331901262,0.9902,0.141,0.015,0.844,Positive,Very Strong

Samantha Clove,how to heal hemorrhoids fast,"at a donald trump rally in north carolina a proud ginger glover waved a lyin hillary doll with a special edition noose on it 
watch a clip with glover at the wednesday rally here via nbc news  
glover said the noose was her way of making a point that hillary clinton should be incarcerated at the very least but when asked said she doesnt think clinton should be killed 
yet her employees put the noose on the doll for her and she brought it out in public and waved it around for effect 
where is all of the trump rallies violent rhetoric and imagery going 
donald trump seems to attract people who are angry and want someone to blame 
the washington post did an incredible story on melanie austin a trump supporter who said trump sees the world like she does she realized this days after she had been injected with something intended to calm her after she was involuntarily committed for homicidal ideation against president obama 
the first time she had seen him at a rally in june she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did that she was one among millions at the time her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her she had gotten them in february during a difficult time in her life when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a rant a series of online postings that included one saying that obama should be hanged and the white house fumigated and burned to the ground on her discharge papers in a box labeled medical problem a doctor had typed homicidal ideation 
donald trump and the altright and indeed way too many elected republicans have already pointed these folks at hillary clinton and barack obama as evil people who must be harmed when you attract unstable people who are easily manipulated out of anger and fear and then direct them to harm someone as trump and his advisers have done suggesting hillary clinton might be shot and saying she should be executed with a firing squad you are responsible for inciting violence 
things are not going well for trump supporters and even buoyed as they are with unscientific online polls and delusions fed by the altright media and fox news they smell defeat 
perhaps thats not connected to this specific woman who brought a hillary clinton doll in a noose to wave at a trump rally last night but it is a trend were seeing in general  angry trump fans using more and more violent rhetoric 
there will be more of this not less as trumps likely defeat becomes reality outside of tinfoil circles 
this is political intimidation that mimics donald trumps despotic promises to jail clinton even though shes been cleared of wrongdoing in all of the relentless republican investigations into her activities as secretary of state 
of which there will be plenty more republicans promise us should she win  because just like the trump camp doesnt want you to vote republicans only want government to work when theyre not in power 
the potent mixture of tinfoil and rage is creating a toxic brew of violent fantasies and rhetoric among trump supporters

Alex Ansary,suspect captured in ambushstyle killings of two iowa cops,"warning or threat hillary hints at second civil war if trump wins  
while speaking to supporters in cincinnati on monday democrat hillary clinton hinted at a second civil war if gop nominee donald trump wins breitbartcom reported 
charlie spiering wrote 
he has a dark and divisive vision for america that could tear our country apart clinton said to supporters in cincinnati ohio on halloween 
clinton specifically referred to the civil war suggesting that the country faced a similar threat of divisiveness from donald trump 
abraham lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand and that was over the greatest of challenges  the challenge posed by slavery  and we fought a civil war she said 
she warned voters that it was time for the country to take the divisions in the country seriously 
but we also have to take stock of how divided we are today the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together she added failing to admit that her side is the one that has divided america by race class and gender 
she also claimed that trump would start a nuclear war if a foreign leader got under his skin 
i know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fearmongering but i dont think so she said at a rally in kent ohio earlier in the day 
a post at barracuda brigade observed 
liberals especially the clinton are always projecting anything that they accuse the other side of is what they are doing she suggests that her message is one of hope and change when in fact it is just more of the same 
moreover trump has spent a great deal of time talking about policies and issues while clinton  co have done absolutely nothing but engage in fearmongering and fingerpointing 
still we have to ask  was clintons hint a warning or a threat

brooding and bearded face shadowed by an odd hat cutlass scars on his arms and a dark patch where his eye ought to be the pirate is a familiar stereotype countless movies have worn him down to a smooth and unremarkable cliche 
but what if that cliche has depths that have yet to be mined by the movie industry 
that is the question that israeliamerican director arnon z shorr blood and stone a legend of the golem a modest suggestion glimpse has chosen to tap into with the pirate captain toledano  beneath the pirates hat hides another sort of hat a jewish one for the pirate captain toledano is a jewish pirate what sort of jew becomes a pirate and why 
touching on true history that is one of the questions that shorrs film proposes to answer 
recent years have seen growing interest in the history of jewish pirates and what initially seems absurd quickly becomes a fascinating exploration of how much of history is lost when legend becomes cliche as a pioneering filmmaker arnon z shorr has chosen to tackle this ambitious project with the aid of two vessels at the ocean institute a dedicated cast and support from the public 
though the process of bringing the pirate captain toledano from vision to reality has only begun the journey has already been marked by fortuitous coincidences including the discovery that cast member stephen decordova captain toledano hailed from ancestors who were jewish pirates and a treasured kiddush cup in his possession which likely dates back from those days will play a key role in the story

democratic us vicepresidential nominee tim kaine announced saturday that he believes the catholic church will change its position on samesex marriage the virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue the catholic church is also likely to follow suit speaking at the th annual human rights campaigns national dinner in washington the roman catholic senator reportedly said i think its going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who in the first chapter of genesis surveyed the entire world including mankind and said it is very good 
and besides he continued we are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value by definition that means that every single person and every single citizen is able  no scratch that  encouraged to practice his civil religious and above all sexual liberties to the best of their abilities and im sorry that some people dont like it but to deny samesex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless and the catholic church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it which is what its doing right now 
kaine also added that if all else fails there are ways of making the catholic church listen to the voice of reason which is how he dubbed all those who advocate lgbt equality at the end of the day you know were a civilized people of course the first thing well do is act nicely and ask nicely he said then if that doesnt work well use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are or rather the lbgt community will do that  and it has the supreme courts ruling on samesex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works it actually functions 
so what im saying here he argued is that while i respect the catholic church as im sure millions of americans do you know at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the christian faith and were talking about an institution thats supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it so when that happens and thats whats happening with condemning lgbt rights well state an ultimatum the united states of america more precisely the future president of the united states of america hillary clinton will state an ultimatum and that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on samesex marriage or pack its bags and get out of america and yes  the president of the country can do that 
and in case anybodys wondering  no donald trump wont do the same because he doesnt care about anyone other than donald trump on the other hand hillary clinton is a shining example of honesty integrity and democracy and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout america are loved respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term what happens after that is not our problem kaine concluded",awdnews.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,56,9,2937,525,4.575238095238095,525.0,-0.1822031951418003,-0.2020278943791856,-0.0110584457326234,0.0450775633565519,-0.5071531058079708,0.0577288782288952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.9975,0.166,0.032,0.802,Positive,Very Strong

Alex Ansary,kremlin nato was created for agression,"janet reno first female us attorney general dies at   
npr 
janet reno the first woman to serve as attorney general of the united states died early monday from complications of parkinsons disease renos goddaughter gabrielle dalemberte and sister margaret hurchalla confirmed her passing to npr 
reno spent her final days at home in miami surrounded by family and friends dalemberte told the associated press she was  
reno served longer in the job than anyone had in  years and her tenure was marked by tragedy and controversy but she left office widely respected for her independence and accomplishments 
she was not president bill clintons first choice to head the justice department nor his second but after his no  pick went down in confirmation flames and his second choice also proved controversial clinton finally turned to reno 
she was an unexpected pick she had no connections to clinton or washington but clinton wanted a woman and reno was a bigtime prosecutor holding the top prosecutors job in miamidade county a position she had been elected to four times over  years 
jamie gorelick who would later become deputy attorney general was assigned to prep reno for her confirmation hearing she was the least airbrushed candidate we have ever had for a cabinetlevel position says gorelick she was herself and she didnt change herself for washington 
reno arrived at the justice department knowing no one and was immediately plunged into the siege at the branch davidian compound outside waco texas four federal agents had been killed and  wounded while serving a warrant to search for illegal guns seven weeks into the siege pressed by the fbi reno authorized a raid on the compound resulting in  deaths including as many as  children and the davidian leader david koresh who ordered his followers to set fire to the compound 
in two sets of waco congressional hearings over the next two years reno would successfully quell critics on the right and left 
what haunted me reno explained at one hearing was that if i did not go in i might be sitting there  days later  when koresh came out with explosives blew himself some agents and the entire place up 
years later however in an interview with npr shortly before leaving office her regret was palpable well never know whether it was a mistake or not in one sense reno admitted but knowing what i do i would not do it again i would try to figure another way 
waco didnt make her hesitant it made her insistent about getting her own information observes walter dellinger who served in two top justice department jobs under reno 
dellinger believes for instance that it may have been the waco experience that led reno to go personally to miami in april  to see if there was a way to avoid a forcible removal of yearold cuban refugee elián gonzález from the home of a greatuncle so the boy could be returned to his only living parent in cuba 
elián had been rescued at sea after his mother and eight others drowned trying to get to the united states rescued by fishermen and brought to the us he was soon turned over to his greatuncle the cuban community in miami was in an uproar over the idea of returning the boy to his father who lived in cuba and the furor soon bled over to congress 
but when negotiations with the greatuncle failed armed federal agents acting on renos orders raided the home removed elián and turned him over to his father who had come to the us to receive his son when the us supreme court refused to intervene the two returned to their home in cuba

over the course of time reno would become embroiled in many controversies she sought the appointment of a series of independent counsels to investigate four fellow cabinet members and president clinton himself but she refused to authorize an independent counsel investigation of contributions to the clintongore campaign after justice department lawyers concluded no crime had been committed by either the president or vice president 
the decision so infuriated republicans that some called for her impeachment this is the most politicized justice department in the history of the united states railed dan burton the republican chairman of a key house oversight committee 
at  feet  inches however reno stood tall in the political crosswinds gorelick observes that when members of congress like burton were unhappy with a government official they threatened to call that official to testify but reno who had served as a staffer in the florida state legislature always said fine ill be there as a result says gorelick eventually all those who were threatening her with a hearing stopped doing that because she prevailed in every outing that i can recall  she just went in there and laid out her views and bested those who would challenge her 
the controversies that the justice department faced during renos reign often eclipsed the many things that went well the quick apprehension and successful prosecution of the oklahoma city bombers for example the pursuit of bombers of womens health clinics that provide abortions and the solving of the socalled unabomber case 
after nearly two decades of fruitless pursuit the fbi still had no idea as to the identity of the man dubbed the unabomber who had killed three people and injured  then in  the bomber sent a letter to the new york times offering to cease his terror campaign if the times or the washington post would publish his word manifesto against modern industry and technology neither newspaper was inclined to do that initially but reno the daughter of two newspaper journalists persuaded the newspaper owners to jointly publish the essay in the interests of public safety 
it paid off the unabombers brother recognized the style and ideas in the essay and tipped off the fbi ending the bombers long reign of terror theodore kaczynski aka the unabomber is now serving a life term in a maximum security federal prison 
in  reno was diagnosed with parkinsons disease she did not slow down but her hands sometimes shook so hard you could hear them knocking against the table at a congressional hearing she even joked about the disease claiming that shaking sometimes helps as in playing a steel drum or balancing her kayak 
that combination of toughness and selfdeprecating humor plus her determination to protect the justice department from improper influence made her a hero to many who worked for her 
janet reno led with her values says former deputy attorney general gorelick the departments no  official and that meant that if she decided that a certain path was the right thing to do the people around her believed her and would charge up any hill behind her  id never seen that before in quite the same way 
florida gubernatorial candidate and former us attorney general janet reno speaks at the florida democratic party state conference on april   in lake buena vista fla she lost the democratic primary 
reno won enormous respect inside the department as well because of her work ethic and dedication to understanding issues in the many parts of the justice department  from national security to environmental questions to the generally obscure field of indian law 
us attorney general loretta lynch called her one of the most effective decisive and wellrespectedleaders in the departments proud history who never shied from criticism or shirked responsibility and former attorney general eric holder said that in a city where too many compromise their values for short term political gain janet reno stood out as a person of integrity and of enduring values 
former solicitor general dellinger believes that reno was prepared for the attorney generals job early in life by her intellect and ungainly height this is a woman that went to cornell and harvard law school at a time when very few women went to harvard law school went through junior high and high school being twice as tall as anybody else and probably twice as smart  and thats really really tough 
there were of course ups and downs in the eight years of renos reign but she said she always took the long view of her job 
if the end brings me out right what people said about me wont make any difference and if the end brings me out wrong  angels saying i was right wont make any difference she said in an interview with npr in  
president clinton made little secret of his frequent displeasure with reno and the wall of separation she erected between the justice department and the white house still he never asked her to resign reno was the last cabinet member he reappointed after his reelection in  
it was actually quite wonderful said dellinger she just decided to stay and it turns out that nobody could fire her 
the tension between clinton and his attorney general was apparent even as clintons time in office drew to a close in an interview with cbs news  minutes  clinton went out of his way to praise friends and foes alike but when it came to his evaluation of reno he was tepid to say the least 
good woman he said tried really hard to do a good job shes a good person 
at least he didnt say i was a bad person replied reno with a laugh ill take what i can get 
indeed by the end of her tenure janet reno had outlasted her critics and earned such a reputation for integrity and independence that comedian will ferrells parody of her became one of the iconic skits on nbcs saturday night live  the recurring skit was inspired by reports that reno had cut quite a figure dancing at a justice department party 
on the last episode of the janet renos dance party parody ferrell wearing a blue dress and pearls reminisces about past glories and laments that the end of the party is near then suddenly the real janet reno comes crashing through the wall of the set wearing the same blue dress and pearls as ferrell to deliver one of ferrells signature lines its reno time

EdJenner,texas officer shot dead outside police hq,"snowflake colbert didnt want to write jokes about trump winning by hank berrien november   
conversing with fellow daily show comic john oliver at the montclair film festival on saturday night late show unfunny host stephen colbert admitted that he couldnt even conceive that donald trump would win the presidency so much so that he couldnt write jokes bout trump winning for election night 
in the roughly twohour discussion and qa titled wow that was weird montclair film festival executive director tom hall set the somber tone by allowing when we planned this evening i think we all thought wed be looking back with laughter instead of looking forward with deep concern about the uncertainty we face 
speaking of the late show s election night special on showtime colbert admitted that the staff was prepared for every result of the election except the one that actually transpired 
there was not a bear big enough in the world that we werent loaded for we were so loaded for every possible eventuality we had so many guests we had so many pretaped pieces all based on a different eventuality we had three shows hillary clinton wins and we know hillary clinton wins and we dont know because its not called before the shows over donald trumps going to win and we dont know because everyone said he had such a narrow path to victory thats not wishful thinking thats what everyone was saying 
and then there was the last show which is the show we did which is donald trump is going to win and we know hes going to win my execs and my writers were like you dont want to write something for that and im like no there is nothing you can write you dont understand i have  people in my theater if we know donald trump is going to win its going to be like doing standup comedy for one of those chilean soccer stadiums where the villagers watch you execute one of the natives there will be no laughter we only did about  minutes of material before we went f it its going to be him lets just talk for another hour so i think we have two and a half whole shows that you will never see of material that we had to kill that night 
colbert moaned that the special was the hardest thing ive ever done in my life adding i was tying my tie at  and i went oh he took ohio oh well we expected that he took it by  points wow thats not expected and then over my guests shoulders people kept holding up signs that said florida iowa nebraska he revealed that numerous fake commercials were prepared but none of them were appropriate once we knew we were playing to an audience of the condemned our audience was sobbing openly and those are people who work for me like my cameramen 
as daily wire editorinchief ben shapiro pointed out years ago  colberts manipulative act has been laced with hatred of conservatives 
he engages in conservativeface he needs no makeup or bulbous appendage to play a conservative  after all conservatives come in every shape and size instead he acts as though he is a conservative  an idiotic racist sexist bigoted brutal conservative he outarchie bunkers archie bunker his audience laughs and scoffs at brutal religious colbert who wishes to persecute gays they chortle at evil sexist colbert who thinks men are victims of sexism this is the purpose of colberts routine his show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks in order to justify their racism racists had to create a false perception of blacks in the same way colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives 
on saturday night colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a trump presidency arguing im all for giving him a chance but dont give him an inch because i believed everything he said and i remember everything he said and its horrifying its possible the job changes a man thats the cliche of the presidency he pontificated 
every president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say well there are levers of power in washington that can slow him down but two things one is theyre cowards second is that the levers in washington are apparently merely attached to blinking red lights that make the people happy when they pull because they tried to stop trump everybody tried to stop trump do not delude yourself 
everyone except the people hes going to appoint tried to stop him and they didnt he owes them nothing he goes out on the balcony and he says to the crowd shall i do it and they say yes and he says it shall be so and the balcony is twitter he goes onto twitter and he goes what do you think do you think im right thats what scares me that he owes the checks and balances of washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldnt and hes a vindictive person so its all going to be fine merry christmas no there is nothing you can write stephen colbert 
colbert concluded the next person who says to me you must be happy on a certain level is going to have their eye carved out

No Author,life  people who came to my garage sale who seem to be sticking around for dinner,"email 
the cruelty of factory farms is a daily nightmare for billions of animals but that might soon start to change thanks to a forwardthinking initiative by one of the biggest names in the meat industry in a humane act of compassion for their livestock the oscar mayer company now requires its pork suppliers to give their pigs one thrilling sexual experience before sending them to slaughter 
its pretty difficult to overstate what a huge leap forward this is for animal rights 
the details of the new policy are extremely promising once a pig reaches sexual maturity factory workers must lather it in a warming lubricant and place it in an outdoor pen where it will encounter dozens of sows in heat and boars specially bred to produce voluptuously potent pheromone levels the pigs will then be encouraged to partake in any variety of sowonboar sowonsow boaronboar or autoerotic swineplay they prefer only after theyve bellowed long guttural squeals of satisfaction will these pigs be killed processed and separated into their desirable parts for human consumption 
conscious consumers can rest assured oscar mayer pork will have been treated to full prostate and teat stimulation via doubleprodded toys clamps and strategically placed ice cubes before being sent to the slaughterhouse farmers will even have to install sprinklers emitting warm hog urine for any pig who might be into that 
wow it seems like oscar mayer is truly dedicated to setting a new bar for ethical animal treatment 
to put this in perspective not even freerange operations keep pig behavior specialists onsite to spot hogs nearing ejaculation and pull them away in order to temporarily evade orgasm thereby extending the hogs arousal and making their eventual climaxes that much more explosive for a household meat brand like oscar mayer to endorse this kind of practice is a really really big deal 
before slaughter we intend to treat our pigs to nothing less than the absolute highest order of hoofshattering orgasms said oscar mayer president mark magnesen in a press release our commitment to the wellbeing of animals means ensuring that no pig reaches an abbatoir without first experiencing a flesh romp so sensational it causes their numbing limbs to buckle under fullbodied tailtosnout pleasure 
just yes even peta has to admit that this is a great new direction for pork producers 
taste tests held by the company revealed that customers unanimously preferred meat from sexually gratified pigs over meat from pigs raised under typical factoryfarm stresses interested in trying some yourself or just want to support the cause look for the special label theyve created to specify that their products came from a pig they made squeal in wanton rapture 
well it looks like oscar mayer is finally getting on the right side of animal rights history this is exactly the thoughtful kind of action consumers want to see food companies enact they could have easily just asked suppliers to masturbate a few pigs to completion and called it change but the level of care theyre pouring into these bacchanalian thrills shows that theyre truly making animal welfare a priority 
any progress for farm animals is welcome progress and hopefully this is a sign of even better living conditions to come one blowout circus of carnal delights is the least they can do for these pigs",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,81,16,3346,554,5.021660649819495,554.0,0.5821727884352664,1.1132771126736014,0.0971513671003661,0.0905403062684021,-0.0665778253870732,0.1042545222362295,0.0054151624548736,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0099225983988921,0.9992,0.246,0.032,0.722,Positive,Very Strong

republican presidential candidate donald trump signaled thursday plans to seek nationwide changes to school curricula with the goal of promoting american pride and patriotism in americas schools 
in a trump administration i plan to work directly with the american legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to americas children trump said speaking at the american legions annual convention in cincinnati 
we want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of americas history its institutions and its heroes many of whom are with us today he told the veterans group 
the comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools which is prohibited under federal lawwe will stop apologizing for america and we will start celebrating america we will be united by our common culture values and principles becoming one american nation one country under one constitution saluting one american flag and always saluting it trump said 
last year a denverarea school board sought to change the content of the ap us history course because some board members thought it failed to promote patriotism 
that sparked a political proxy war in jefferson county colorado and the  school board election drew nearly  million in campaign funding from outside interest groups 
public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money most schools receive little federal funding

    taksim square  gezi park protests istanbul credit alan hilditch  flickr
democracy grants people the right to protest to show their opinion on matters that affect their lives and their nations protesting is a universally acknowledged fact belonging to the modern world it serves to give voice to those who are disturbed by the faulty policies drawbacks and negligence of their governments and who wish to raise public awareness on these matters demonstrations rallies strikes pickets boycotts and so on are all ways of protesting as long as they are within the limits defined by the law protests and acts of similar nature are in essence an indisputable part of democracy freedom of opinion and expression
however in some cases protesting is exploited and used as a means of opposing democracy itself protests that give way to riots are now methods of staging coups to shut down administrations and overthrow democratically elected governments
legitimacy of protests and feasibility of demands
democratic protests are welcomed by societies and addressed by governments to the extent that their demands are tangible justified and feasible  protests lacking those qualities are most likely to fail in having their demands met
the antigovernment movement in bulgaria in  confirmed the validity of these qualities the protests took place in three separate cycles january and february witnessed rallies that objected to the high prices of electricity and demanded the government resign they were successful as the requests were sensible a later demonstration was against a government officer and resulted in his resignation yet another cycle of protests called for a change of the system along with some other illegal demands and faced defeat after turning into riots that were not supported by the overall society
more gruesome video shows turkish soldiers execute female kurdish pkk fighters by shooting in their heads  bombers stopped by police blew themselves up in turkey dispute over kurds and coup attempt threatens usturkey alliance the attempted coup détat made turkey band together the gezi park protests in turkey in the same year followed the same pattern set in motion with a good willed and environmentalist approach it was likely to succeed considering its solid and feasible calls and legitimate ways at first the government heeded the nature lovers voices and took a positive step by postponing a construction project that required the destruction of gezi park yet the humanist approach of young people changed course in the wake of provocations of separatist and terrorist gangs and turned into a totally different nature demonstrations that began in gezi park in istanbul and that demanded the preservation of gezi park as a recreational area spread to other cities of the country and transformed into armed and bloody uprising imposing the fall of government it was a quite clear coup detat attempt that did not refrain from using violent methods and openly rejected the validity of a democratically elected government the protests were contradictory considering people took to streets using their democratic rights but then appealed to nondemocratic methods to lay their claims ignoring the will of the nation
though justified at the beginning these two cases of protests demonstrate that they are open to hostile manipulations and may lose their legitimacy if left at the hands of illminded people recently some dark powers have been using this latest technique to manage countries internal affairs as they see fit and stage coups to overthrow governments they bring in professional teams of brutal killers amidst peaceful protests which then lead to violent antidemocratic clashes these protests sometimes end up in civil wars where fellows of the same nation kill one another it all happens in the wake of a governments nonyielding to some dark powers demands and a democratically elected government faces antidemocratic attempts
methods of provocations and otpor
such dramatic outcomes come by the employment of social media social media becomes an instrument for organizing stirring and agitating the masses that are presumed to join the demonstrations various provocative organizations undertake the organization of some agents and provocateurs who take part in demonstrations by inciting them to get violent these illegal subcontractors organize the public relations part of the riots and channel intellectual circles of the country such as its authors academicians journalists and members of nongovernmental institutions to act against democratically elected government in the name of democracy and to lead the public
one of the most common groups among these  professional revolutionary organizations  is a serbiabased resistance organizationotpor  independent observers state that otpor organizes coup attempts and civil disturbance by providing training and logistic support for the usbacked dissident organizations in many countries such as the former yugoslavia serbia georgia bulgaria ukraine egypt brazil and turkey there is a consensus that the cia has been creating riots and social disturbances in fifty countries otpor its offshoot canvas
a relevant source puts forward the following interesting findings otpor 
the otpor s  fistlogo would turn up  years later in the streets of cairo  illustrating further the preposterous foreignbacked nature of the egyptian uprisings serbias otpor would continue receiving funds from the west and become a ciacoup college of sorts under the name of canvas center for applied nonviolent action and strategies 
the research article penned by carl gibson and steve horn and published on occupycom deals with the international financial intelligence and political connections of otpor and features the following information based on wikileaks documents
serbias srdja popovic is known by many as a leading architect of regime changes in eastern europe and elsewhere since the lates  and as one of the cofounders of otpor popovic and otpors offshoot canvas have also maintained close ties with a goldman sachs executive and the private intelligence firm stratfor as well as the us government 
such examples are easy to find the internal public opinion on otpor is that it is being employed as leverage to overthrow those governments which conflict with the interests of the us no wonder some media organizations that act on behalf of the us administration speak highly of otpor at every turn moreover the british media rigorously advocates that the executives of otpor have nothing to do with the organization of coups
likewise some turkish media organizations disseminated similar statements during the  gezi park demonstrations the attempt to occupy the prime ministers residence by armed groups which is an act of rebellion against the state and treason by law was orchestrated by otpor according to reports yet the media deliberately defined it as the exercise of legitimate democratic rights and freedom of expression by the people and thus desired to create misapprehension to display the members of the marxist and separatist terrorist organizations who are far from representing even a slightest portion of the nation as the representatives of the nation these media organs called the nations security forces who risked their lives to preserve public order and peoples lives as the socalled enemies of freedom and democracy
in truth such mass demonstrations that aim to topple governments divide countries and organize bloody conflicts  and even civil wars  can no longer be called innocent rallies but subtle projects of deep states and shadow organizations to take over countries from within",ahtribune.com,Fake,english,18.28557971467266,2.2264292892673696,8,2,7678,1196,5.40133779264214,1196.0,-1.6498050836097684,-1.5173329014319723,1.2432758394536931,1.0969913734893613,0.3081262793939753,1.1342360206054911,0.0050167224080267,0.0,0.0,0,4,0.0,0.0108093807260732,-0.9972,0.075,0.138,0.786,Negative,Very Strong

No Author,life  ways they truly were the greatest generation,"email 
for friends and family who loved him dearly the death of robert harkin in early august was sudden and unexpected but despite their sadness they can take comfort in knowing that his legacy will live on his sister karen has taken over his facebook page and honors her brother by continuing to share islamophobic rhetoric in his memory 
absolutely beautiful 
they rarely chose to talk about politics while he was alive but karen has been able to reconnect with her brother since his death by discovering his fear and hatred of islam its been a steep learning curve but in time shes been able to understand so much about what he cared about most and she now feels closer to him than ever the threat syrian refugees pose to our freedom the politicians who willingly turn a blind eye to the rising threat of islamic terrorismall of the bigoted beliefs that made robert who he was 
since picking up the mantle of his facebook account karen has committed to maintaining the xenophobia that exemplified her brothers life when time magazine ran a story about a muslim woman who felt unsafe in america karen understood right away that robert would want to share the article with the comment maybe shed feel more safe if she moved to saudia arabia where she can practice sharia law with the rest of them sometimes a sister just knows 
for those who were close to robert seeing a backwards misinformed post decrying the spread of radical islam is like being with him again his page is a place where those who knew him can come share a memory and talk about the spread of sharia lawexactly what robert would have wanted whenever she posts about the inherent violence in the muslim faith karen takes comfort in knowing that with every like and share her brother remains a vibrant part of peoples lives 
in the wake of roberts death i think everyone was just looking for a place to see hateful rhetoric says karen who remembers her brother by spending two to three hours per day scouring the internet for signs of a larger islamic conspiracy i miss him every day but as long as i continue to invite his facebook friends to like a group whose mission is to block the construction of mosques in america its like hes still here

David Risselada,the deceptive nature of hillary clinton is right in line with communism,"posted on october   by claire bernish 
censorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising hillary clinton  and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted 
facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown 
and facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case 
recent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of phan th? kim phúc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang 
that photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image 
ultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader rosa parks arrest 
but taking down of the image of kim phúc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  
trainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters 
in the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division justin osofsky admitted it had been a mistake 
according to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives 
in addition to osofsky global policy chief monika bickert government relations chief joel kaplan vice president for public policy and communications elliot schrage and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals 
all five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others 
company spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand 
for those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors 
indeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification 
although three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error 
in fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences 
earlier this year an exposé by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots 
however considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative 
in a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part 
and i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids 
after a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives 
senior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  
in the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards 
while the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility  and grave importance  of free speech dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter please help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks share this",dcclothesline.com,Fake,english,15.763775383339585,2.2264292892673696,71,12,6831,1078,5.287569573283859,539.0,0.2764223950044397,0.3616742515005802,1.019183635371683,0.9120050402618328,0.195848204210788,0.0801895339565738,0.0009276437847866,0.0,0.0,0,1,0.0,0.0022977426825594,-0.9724,0.084,0.102,0.814,Negative,Very Strong
Activist Post,voters in arkansas north dakota legalize medical marijuana despite federal prohibition,"on october    am  
conservatives claim that voter id is necessary to catch illegal voters but it turns out theyre the only ones creating fake ids to use on election day 
trump supporters are taking trumps call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake id badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them confusing them and filming them  all of which are illegal 
but trumps deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a rightwing group known as vote protectors 
the group which is affiliated with top trump ally roger stone is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on election day they are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes 
according to the huffington post  
stones group created an officiallooking id badge for its volunteers to wear and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake exit polls efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters or at least thats what the group was planning to do before the huffington post asked stone about it on tuesday the controversial trump ally long known for his bareknuckled political tactics said that key proposals on his groups websites were there without his knowledge and assured huffpost that he would operate within the confines of election law 
in fact after huffpo confronted stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website he acknowledged that vote protectors had a bad idea and ordered them taken down 
campaign legal center deputy director danielle lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme 
its inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy she told huffpo in reference to the videotaping when thats being live streamed to the internet it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls objectively intimidating voters is unlawful no matter where you do it 
indeed but thats exactly what donald trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him 
as it turns out hes right about the election being rigged only its conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of trump 
earlier this week a wisconsin city clerk in green bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the wisconsin ethics commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the university of wisconsingreen bay because she has merely heard that students lean democrat 
i was reading the statutes and read no site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party republican appointed clerk kris teske wrote 
uwgb is a polling location for students and residents on election day but i feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole i have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat i have spoken with our chief of staff and others at city hall and they agree that budget wise this isnt going to happen i would like to know your thoughts on this do i have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats 
so not only are trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods they are using voter suppression tactics as well 
and that is likely going to cause a lot of election day chaos voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what trumps deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it

admin,condell americas moment of truth,"newsbusters october   
on wednesdays morning joe  cohost joe scarborough once again was forced to actually tell the truth about the liberal bias in media coverage throughout this entire election 
scarborough a former florida republican congressman began the discussion stating that 
as a republican theres a natural reaction to press bias and it has been so overwhelming even if it is has been earned the media has taken sides theyve aggressively taken sides and theyve admitted that were aggressively taking sides and i think you get some republicans that see that every four years its so funny they do that every four years every four years its like the end of the world if a republican gets elected president because theyre all racist its the boy that cried wolf 
in a sense what was articulated is that the mass medias historic liberal bias against conservatives is reflected in every election so much so that in this one their usual partisan attacks against trumps controversial personality are not as effective also scarborough stated the fact shared by many conservatives that there is an overwhelming and aggressive agenda by the press to defend liberals 
furthermore in conversation with frequent panelist mike barnicle scarborough added also its such a confounding election where we go back and forth on what its about mike barnicle said all along that its about hillary clinton people say im going to vote for hillary clinton as a protest against and then after sitting on that for a couple of weeks that thought for a couple weeks they go ehmaybe not 
in a way they were all trying to explain how trump is still almost tied to clinton in a number of battleground state polls despite the disproportionate amount of negative coverage later on in response to cohost willie geists remarks about the race being almost over scarborough proved his earlier point about the medias disconnect 
i got to say willie everybody that is saying its over and youre a fool if youre suggesting that the american people may have the final say at the voting booth are the same people that were saying in august september october november december january february that there was no way in a million years that donald trump would ever win the republican nomination stating it just as emphatically as theyre stating now that we need to avert our eyes this race is over

Ronald Nelson,comment on nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails  fbi can access them any time by ronald nelson,"theres a reason david brock founder of the liberal group media matters for america chooses to house an unregistered professional solicitor in his office to raise money for his conglomerate of super pacs and nonprofits
professional solicitors are required to disclose their active solicitation contracts brock wants his unregistered solicitor the bonner group to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason
david brock is laundering money 
 
related stories consumers need protection from new consumer protection bureau rule heres what the markets are telling us exposed profiteers of governing  and these are the ones who got caught brock has seven nonprofits three super pacs one  committee one llc one joint fundraising committee and one unregistered solicitor crammed into his office in washington 
uncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations
the bonner group his professional solicitor works off a commission every time money gets passed around bonner receives a  percent cut
 
follow the money 
nonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants
but they arent required to disclose who gives them cash grants
this weak system of oneway verification is being abused by brock hes been cycling money between his organizations for years and the bonner groups  percent commission gets triggered after every pass
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias hannity proposes a sendoff for obama in the event of a trump presidency in  media matters for america raised more than  million
the bonner group was credited for raising these funds media matters paid it a  million commission

that same year media matters gave a  cash grant to brocks franklin education forum  an organization that shares office space with media matters

in  the franklin education forum reported  in total contributions and  percent of that total came from media matters
surprisingly though the franklin education forum gave full credit to bonner for raising that money it paid the fundraiser a  commission in 

notice what happened 
brocks media matters gave a  cash grant to brocks franklin education forum brocks franklin education forum credited the bonner group for raising those funds triggering the  percent commission brock paid the bonner group a  commission to solicit a cash grant  from himself it doesnt stop there 
after the franklin education forum retained  it sent a  cash grant to brocks franklin forum  

note the franklin education forum is a c and the franklin forum is a c they are not the same company 
the franklin forum c paid bonner a commission in   so its safe to assume the fundraiser received a  commission in  unfortunately its hard to tell for sure it still hasnt filed its taxes for 
lets recap 
say for example you donate  to media matters for america this is how david brock would have used your charitable donation in 
media matters would receive your  donation the bonner group would earn a  commission media matters would retain  next media matters would give whats left of your entire donation   to the franklin education forum the bonner group would earn a  commission the franklin education forum would retain  the franklin education forum would then forward the remaining  to the franklin forum the bonner group would earn a  commission the franklin forum would retain  in the end brocks solicitor would have pocketed  almost a third of your initial donation thats a far cry from the advertised  percent commission
as bizarre as that scenario may sound this is exactly what brock did in 
how can we be sure this is intentional 
brock is the chairman for each of these organizations how could he not know whats going on
hes a handson chairman according to their tax returns brock allocates time weekly to his organizations
media matters  hours per week franklin education forum three hours per week the franklin forum one hour per week furthermore the new york times reports that brock shares a summer rental in the hamptons with mary pat bonner the president of the bonner group
brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this these transfers are intentional he vacations with his solicitor case closed
still not convinced 
brock didnt even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers they all share the same number

what if  
we even located the bonner groups solicitation agreement with media matters on floridas gift givers guide  clarification on the commission can be found on page 

in english contractually brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission in spite of this option he intentionally chooses to trigger the  percent commission for money grants between his organizations
note yes we are making the assumption that all of brocks organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the bonner group given that his organizations share the same address board members and telephone number we feel its safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement 
this barely scratches the surface 
utilizing publicfacing tax returns along with records submitted to the federal election commission we mapped out all the significant money transfers from  that took place in brocks office

summary 
this is all from just one year no further commentary required
we understand this may be hard to believe we first came across this in july and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it
all of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources check for yourself  we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in brocks office these data have been sitting out in the open gathering dust for years 
if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck
weve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity but there arent any loopholes david brock has something to hide just last month the daily caller reported the following
brocks former longtime livein boyfriend william grey whom brock has thanked in several of his books threatened to go to the irs with damaging information about how brock was running his media matters empire what did brock do he paid grey  to keep quiet brock reportedly had to sell his home in rehoboth delaware to come up with the money this certainly seems to indicate that brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover
adding to this fox news reported the following
grey accused brock of financial malfeasance and threatened to undermine brocks fundraising efforts
next step is i contact all your donors and the irs grey wrote in an email dated may   this is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now
we believe that the information presented in this article is what has brock so terrified we feel confident in saying with close to absolute certainty that david brock is laundering money through his media matters conglomerate

Jason Easley,new polls suggest that republicans are on the cusp of a total election disaster,"by jason easley on sun oct th  at  pm fox news sundays chris wallace tried to blame hillary clinton for the email scandal that republicans created and got destroyed by clinton campaign manager robbie mook share on twitter print this post 
fox news sundays chris wallace tried to blame hillary clinton for the email scandal that republicans created and got destroyed by clinton campaign manager robbie mook 
this exchange between fox news sunday host chris wallace and clinton campaign manager robbie mook highlighted why the email scandal isnt working for the gop 
video 
transcript via fox news sunday wallace the last question i want to ask you is that youre acting as if it was the director who brought this into the election when the fact is that it was hillary clinton who brought this into the election 
i want to go back to the email exchange on march nd  when the new york times broke the story about hillary clinton using private emails were going to put it up on the screen 
clinton adviser neera tanden why didnt they get the stuff out like  months ago so crazy 
campaign chairman john podesta unbelievable tanden i guess i know the answer they wanted to get away with it 
robby it was clinton who delayed and it was clinton who brought this into the presidential campaign 
mook and it is secretary clinton who has said this was a mistake it is secretary clinton who cooperated fully with the investigation and it was secretary clinton who accepted the outcome of that investigation and what secretary clinton is doing now is saying if theres new information get it out on the table lets get it out these could be duplicates 
again its been reported these emails may not have been sent or received by secretary clinton we dont know anything and this close to an election this unprecedented announcement of new information when  when again its been reported by yahoo news that  that the fbi may have not even seen it that  that  that director comey sent this unprecedented letter shortly before the election when he doesnt even know what the information is thats disturbing and were just asking him get everything out there that he knows 
fox news has no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of clinton so they have been reduced to whining about why she didnt release the emails sooner what wallace left out was that the release of clintons emails represented an unprecedented level of disclosure 
hillary clinton didnt cause this email scandal house republicans misused their benghazi select committee to go on a fishing expedition for hillary clintons emails 
robbie mook destroyed fox news with facts because unlike donald trump hillary clinton hasnt worked to keep information hidden from the public trump has not released his tax returns medical records or an accounting of his business dealings with russia trump has been the least transparent nominee in more than  years 
republicans and conservative media are blaming clinton for the scandal that they created as justification for continuing the investigations of her after the election

its time to get excited because marvel comics just announced a new superhero that advances diversity in comics in a major way the series is called luminary  and it tells the story of a mildmannered caucasian man named percy pendleton who gains incredible superhuman powers and constantly expresses his regret that he was blessed with those abilities instead of a latina woman who could be a role model for young hispanic girls in addition to merely fighting crime 
yes marvel deserves major kudos for this massive step toward inclusive representation in comics 
while working as a nuclear physicist at stark industries percy is caught in a particleaccelerator explosion a surge of neutrinos floods his nervous system and transforms him into the incredible luminary a hero whose amazing powers of flight super strength and energy manipulation make him concerned that as a white man he does nothing to reflect the face of a changing america which is increasingly hispanic and female 
wow what a longoverdue breath of fresh air to see a bigname publisher like marvel feature a white male superhero who thinks its a shame he isnt latina 
for a glimpse of the groundbreaking work you can look forward to in luminary  check out these sample panels marvel released earlier this week 
awesome thanks marvel for proving that white men who wish latinas had better opportunities can be superheroes too we cant wait to read the first issue",clickhole.com,Fake,english,20.0,47.88118811881188,118,21,1434,239,4.97071129707113,239.0,1.7134492441293252,2.052780689139878,-0.4087096650186461,-0.4032791426016945,-0.1168598399134722,-0.4011102316365392,0.0167364016736401,0.0,0.0,0,0,0.0,0.0252732460350386,0.9945,0.254,0.058,0.689,Positive,Very Strong
